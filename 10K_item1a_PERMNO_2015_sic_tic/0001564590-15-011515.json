{"cik": "1122051", "company": "XTERA COMMUNICATIONS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business, prospects, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the risks and uncertainties described below, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of significant operating losses, anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nAs of September 30, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $384.7 million. We experienced a net loss of $16.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and $26.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. We expect to continue to make significant expenditures related to the development of our business, including expenditures to hire additional personnel related to the sales, marketing and development of our products and to maintain and expand our research and development operations. In addition, as a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur when were a private company. As a result of these increased expenditures, we will have to generate and sustain increased revenue, manage our cost structure and avoid significant liabilities in order to achieve future profitability. We also may incur losses in the future for a number of other unforeseen reasons. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, and we may continue to incur significant losses in the future.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investor or analyst expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indicator of our future performance. Fluctuations in our revenue can lead to even greater fluctuations in our operating results. Our budgeted expense levels depend in part on our expectations with respect to long-term future revenue and global customers. Given relatively fixed operating costs related to our personnel, any substantial adjustment to our expenses to account for lower levels of revenue will be difficult and take time. Consequently, if our revenue does not meet projected levels, our inventory levels and operating expenses would be high relative to revenue, which would impair our operating results.\nIn addition to other risks discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to fluctuations in our revenue and our operating results include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand, sales cycles, product mix and prices for our solutions and our services;\n\u2022\nreductions in customers\u2019 budgets for solutions purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles;\n\u2022\norder cancellations or reductions or delays in delivery schedules by our customers;\n\u2022\ntimeliness of our customers\u2019 payments for their purchases;\n\u2022\npreparedness of customers for the installation of our solutions;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new product announcements or upgrades by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nany significant changes in the competitive dynamics of our market, including any new entrants, technological advances or substantial discounting of products;\n\u2022\navailability of third-party suppliers to provide products and services for us;\n\u2022\nthe timing of recognizing revenue in any given quarter, including the impact of revenue recognition standards in United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses, the costs of, and the lead times associated with, obtaining the components we purchase and the costs of warranty or repair work; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and adverse geopolitical conditions in domestic and international markets.\nIf our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may in the future provide to the market, the price of our common stock may decline substantially.\nOur gross margin may fluctuate from period to period and may be adversely affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur gross margin fluctuates from period to period and varies by product configuration. Our gross margin may continue to be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nmix of products and services sold during the period;\n\u2022\nprice discounts negotiated by our customers;\n\u2022\nincreased price competition, including competition from lower-cost suppliers in China and other markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in the price or availability of components for our products;\n\u2022\ncharges for excess or obsolete inventory;\n\u2022\nincreased warranty or repair costs;\n\u2022\nsales volume from each customer during the period; and\n\u2022\nthe period of time over which ratable recognition of revenue occurs.\nFor example, our gross margin percentage for the year ended September 30, 2015 was 16.8%, as compared with 33.7% for the year ended September 30, 2014. The decrease in gross margin percentage in the 2015 period was primarily driven by the mix of products sold during the period. In particular, our turnkey solutions have lower gross margins than our equipment sales, and to the extent we have a greater proportion of revenue from turnkey solutions in any period, our gross margin percentage will be lower. As a result of our relative size and the often large, complex nature of the projects in which we make product installations, we have limited ability to control the scheduling of the installation of our products and are often requested to reschedule installations. This rescheduling may cause us to redeploy our personnel and could result in us being unable to meet commitments to our other customers, which may negatively impact our gross margins. Further, this rescheduling could cause revenue to be recognized later than forecasted. As a result of our relatively fixed operating costs associated with our personnel, if our revenue does not meet projected levels in a particular quarter, our gross margin for that quarter will be adversely affected. Fluctuations in gross margin may make it difficult to manage our business and achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe may have difficulty acquiring new customers due to the high up-front costs of switching optical network providers or equipment, and if we are unable to acquire new customers, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nTelecommunications service providers typically make substantial investments when deploying an optical network. Once a network operator has deployed an optical network for a particular portion of their network, it is often difficult and costly to switch to another vendor\u2019s infrastructure. Unless we are able to persuasively demonstrate that our solutions offer performance, functionality and cost advantages that materially outweigh a customer\u2019s expense of switching from a competitor\u2019s product, it may be difficult for us to procure new customers and generate sales once that competitor\u2019s equipment has been deployed. In addition, many telecommunications service providers base their deployment decisions primarily on price, and if we are unable to establish better pricing terms for our solutions, we may be unable to acquire new customers.\nAggressive business tactics by our competitors may harm our business.\nIncreased competition in our markets has resulted in our competitors engaging in aggressive business tactics, especially when we compete for large customers. These tactics include:\n\u2022\nselling equipment or inventory at a discount, including at or below cost;\n\u2022\nannouncing competing products prior to market availability combined with extensive marketing efforts;\n\u2022\noffering low pricing on products competitive to ours as part of a larger, bundled product offering;\n\u2022\nproviding financing, marketing and advertising assistance to customers; and\n\u2022\nasserting intellectual property rights irrespective of the validity of the claims.\nIf we fail to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, or if our current or future competitors continue or expand aggressive business tactics, including those described above, demand for our solutions could decline, we could experience delays or cancellations of customer orders, we could be required to reduce our prices or we may experience increased expenses.\nThe markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to compete.\nCompetition in the optical networking industry is intense, and we expect such competition to increase. A number of very large companies historically have dominated the optical networking industry. Our primary competitors in the submarine market include Alcatel-Lucent Submarine Networks, SAS, Coriant GmbH, Huawei Marine Networks Co., Limited, NEC Corporation and TE Subcom, a TE Connectivity Ltd. company. In the terrestrial market, our primary competitors include Alcatel-Lucent S.A., Ciena Corporation, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Infinera Corporation and Coriant GmbH. Many of our competitors are substantially larger, have greater name recognition, as well as technical, financial and marketing resources, and may have established relationships with our potential customers. Many of our competitors have more resources to develop or acquire, and more experience in developing or acquiring, new products and technologies and in creating market awareness for those products and technologies. In addition, many of our competitors have the financial resources and product portfolios to offer products competitive with ours at below market pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively.\nIn addition, some of our foreign competitors are able to compete more effectively by obtaining financing for their customers from government-sponsored sources. We also compete with low-cost suppliers in China that have the ability to increase pricing pressure on us.\nOur ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide a better solution than our competitors at a competitive price. We may be required to make substantial additional investments in research and development, sales and marketing and customer support in order to respond to competition, and there is no assurance that these investments will achieve any returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future. Increased competition could lead to fewer customer orders, price reductions, reduced margins and loss of market share, any of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDemand for our solutions depends in part on the rate that telecommunications service providers expand and enhance their optical networks and the rate that telecommunications service providers and content service providers build out new optical networks. If such service providers do not continue to expand and enhance their networks or build out new networks, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur future success as a provider of high-capacity optical transport solutions ultimately depends on the continued growth of the optical networking industry and, in particular, the continued demand for bandwidth. The amount of data transmitted over optical networks will be impacted by the growth of bandwidth demand. Increased demand by subscribers for bandwidth-intensive applications delivered over network systems will be necessary to justify capital expenditure commitments by telecommunications service providers and content service providers to invest in the improvement and expansion of their networks, or alternatively to build out new networks. Demand for improved optical networking infrastructure might not continue to increase if there is limited availability or market acceptance, if the content offered through networks does not attract widespread interest or if the quality of service available through networks does not meet user expectations. If long-term expectations for bandwidth-intensive and cloud-based applications are not realized, these service providers may not commit significant capital expenditures to upgrade their networks to improve capacity or to build out new networks, the demand for our solutions and services will decrease and we may not be able to sustain or increase our levels of revenue or achieve profitability in the future. Broad macroeconomic weakness and market conditions have in the past and could in the future affect spending levels of our customers and demand for our solutions.\nOur concentrated customer base increases the potential adverse effect on us from the loss of one or more customers.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. For the year ended September 30, 2015, Cable & Wireless Communications plc, Defense Information Systems Agency and GlobeNet Inc. accounted for 16.2%, 43.8% and 24.9% of our revenue, respectively, and 95.6% of our revenue was generated by six customers, and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, Cable & Wireless Communications plc, Gulf Bridge International, Inc. and OCI Group Inc. accounted for 25.9%, 22.1% and 24.1% of our revenue, respectively, and 88.7% of our revenue was generated by six customers. Our business and financial results are correlated with the spending of a limited number of customers and can be significantly affected by market, industry or competitive dynamics affecting their businesses. The timing of customer purchases and of their requested delivery of purchased product is difficult to predict, and our ability to continue to generate revenue from key customers will depend on our ability to maintain strong relationships with these customers and introduce new products and services that are desirable to these customers at competitive prices. In addition, in certain circumstances our customers can terminate or reduce their contracts for convenience. We expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to contribute materially to our revenue for the next few years. The loss of, or a significant delay or reduction in purchases by, a small number of customers could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe must respond to technological change and comply with evolving industry standards and requirements for our products to be successful, and if we do not, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe optical networking industry is characterized by technological change, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. The introduction of new communications technologies and the emergence of new industry standards or requirements could render our products obsolete. Further, in developing our products, we have made, and will continue to make, assumptions with respect to which standards or requirements will be adopted by our customers and competitors. If the standards or requirements adopted by our prospective customers are different from those on which we have focused our efforts, market acceptance of our solutions would be reduced or delayed and our business would be harmed.\nIn response to market changes, we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their existing products and to introduce new products and technologies. To be competitive, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, sales and marketing and customer support. We may not have sufficient resources to make these investments, we may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive and we may not be able to effectively sell our products to targeted customers who have prior relationships with our competitors.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast demand for our solutions, we may have excess or insufficient inventory, which may increase our operating costs, decrease our revenue and harm our business.\nWe are required to generate forecasts of future demand for our solutions several months prior to the scheduled delivery to our prospective customers. This requires us to make significant investments before we know if corresponding revenue will be recognized. Lead times for materials and components that we need to order for the manufacturing of our products vary significantly and depend on factors, such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for each component at a given time. In the past, we have experienced lengthening in lead times for certain components. If the lead times for components are lengthened, we may be required to purchase increased levels of such components to satisfy our delivery commitments to our customers. If we overestimate market demand for our solutions and, as a result, increase our inventory in anticipation of customer orders that do not materialize, we will have excess inventory, which could result in increased risk of obsolescence and significant inventory write-downs. Furthermore, this will result in reduced production volumes and our fixed costs will be spread across fewer units, increasing per unit costs. If we underestimate demand for our solutions, we will have inadequate inventory, which could slow down or interrupt the manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and our ability to recognize revenue. In addition, we may be unable to meet our supply commitments to customers, which could result in a loss of certain customer opportunities or a breach of our customer agreements.\nWe are susceptible to shortages, price fluctuations and quality control risks in our supply chain. Any shortages, price fluctuations or quality concerns in components used in our products could delay shipment of our products, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nShortages in components that we use in our products are possible and our ability to predict the availability of such components may be limited. Furthermore, some of these components are available only from single or limited sources of supply. In addition, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantity requirements and delivery schedules. Any growth in our business or the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to project overall component demand accurately and to establish appropriate component inventory levels. In addition, increased demand by third parties for the components we use in our products may lead to decreased availability and higher prices for those components. We generally rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with our suppliers. As a result, even if available, we may not be able to secure sufficient components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products in a timely manner, which would seriously impact our ability to deliver products to our customers, and our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. If we are unable to pass component price increases along to our customers or maintain stable pricing for components, our gross margin and operating results could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, poor quality in sole-sourced components or certain other components in our products could also result in lost sales or lost sales opportunities. If the quality of such components does not meet our standards or our customers\u2019 requirements, if we are unable to obtain components from our existing suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or if any of our sole source providers cease to continue to manufacture such components or to remain in business, we could be forced to redesign our products and qualify new components from alternate suppliers. Further, if components we obtain from our suppliers contain technology that infringes on a third party\u2019s intellectual property, we could be forced to redesign our products or find alternate sources of such components. The development of alternate sources for those components can be time-consuming, difficult and costly, and we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner. Even if we are able to locate alternate sources of supply, we could be forced to pay for expedited shipments of such components or our products at dramatically increased costs.\nWe provide turnkey solutions to our customers, which subject us to additional risks inherent with being the prime contractor on a project that, if realized, may adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition to providing our hardware and software products to customers, we also provide turnkey solutions for customers. We oversee project planning, partner management and installation of the projects in which our products are utilized. We anticipate turnkey solutions will represent a significant percentage of our product revenue for our fiscal years ending September 30, 2016 and 2017. As the prime contractor, we are ultimately responsible for the project, including any performance issues, damages or cost overruns. Our actual costs and any gross profit realized on a turnkey solution could vary from the estimated amounts on which our bid was originally based. This may occur for various reasons, including errors in estimates or bidding, changes in availability and cost of labor, equipment and materials and unforeseen technical and logistical challenges, including with managing our geographically widespread operations and the performance of third party subcontractors, suppliers and manufacturers. In particular, if the third party subcontractors, suppliers and manufacturers we engage are unable to perform to our requirements, we may be forced to pursue alternative strategies to obtain these goods or services, which could result in delays, interruptions, additional expenses to us and loss of customers. These variations and the risks inherent in our turnkey solutions may result in reduced profitability or losses on these projects. Depending on the size of a project, variations from estimated contract performance could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, and may dilute your ownership of our common stock.\nWe have historically relied on outside financing to fund our operations, capital expenditures and expansion. We may require additional capital from equity or debt financing in the future to take advantage of strategic opportunities, including more rapid expansion of our business or the acquisition of complementary products, technologies or businesses and developing new products or enhancements to existing products.\nWe may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of any additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense, which may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nOur sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use and benefit of our solutions, including their technical capabilities and potential cost savings. Customers typically undertake a significant evaluation process before making a purchase, in some cases over six months. We spend substantial time and resources in our sales efforts, and in limited cases, order inventory for potential sales without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, product purchases are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. Our long sales cycle may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nWe depend on contract manufacturers and logistics providers to manufacture and deliver a majority of our products, and changes to these relationships or their inability to obtain necessary parts may result in delays or disruptions that could harm our business.\nWe depend primarily on Foxconn Technology Group, as well as MC Assembly and Surface Technology International Ltd., each an independent contract manufacturer, to manufacture and assemble a majority of our products, and CEVA Logistics, an independent logistics and freight management provider, to coordinate the delivery of a majority of our products. Our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and logistics processes and exposes us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, and product supply and timing. Our reliance on contract manufacturers could also increase the potential for infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. While we rely on a combination of purchase orders and supply contracts with these manufacturers, their ability to timely perform under their agreements with us is subject to the performance of third-party suppliers from whom our contract manufacturers order many of the components and parts necessary for the manufacturing of our products. If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third-party suppliers effectively, or if any of these suppliers suffers from increased manufacturing lead times, capacity constraints or quality control problems, work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output, they may be unable to meet our customers\u2019 delivery schedules, which would result in lost revenue, additional product costs and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships.\nThese contract manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders. We do not have long-term contracts with our manufacturers that guarantee capacity, the continuation of particular pricing terms, or the extension of credit limits. Accordingly, they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements, which could result in supply shortages, and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice. In addition, our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of the overall orders received by our contract manufacturers from their customers. As a result, fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority by one or more of our contract manufacturers in the event the contract manufacture is constrained in its ability to fulfill all of its customer obligations in a timely manner.\nIt is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement a contract manufacturer relationship. If we are required to change contract manufacturers, whether due to an interruption in their business, quality control problems or otherwise, or if we are required to add additional contract manufacturers, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales to existing or potential customers, delayed revenue or an increase in our costs that could adversely affect our gross margin.\nFurthermore, if our logistics provider incurs any interruptions, delays or problems in its business, our ability to ship our products in a timely and efficient manner would be impaired, which could harm our business and customer relationships and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nA portion of our sales are to countries outside of the United States, and are in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and therefore subject to foreign currency fluctuation. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency rates could have a material impact on our revenue in future periods. We also have exposure to currency exchange rates as a result of the growth in our non-U.S. dollar denominated operating expense in Europe, Asia and Canada. We may in the future enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Any such hedging programs, if implemented, would reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on certain transactions, but would not cover all foreign-denominated transactions and would not entirely eliminate the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that may adversely affect our operating results.\nOver the last several years, we derived a significant portion of our revenue from customers outside the United States, and we continue to expand our international operations. As of September 30, 2015, approximately 37% of our employees were located abroad, and we expect to continue to add personnel internationally. Any continued expansion into international markets will require significant resources and management attention and will subject us to additional regulatory, economic and political risks, and we cannot be sure that any further international expansion will be successful. Furthermore, in some countries, our success in selling our products and growing revenue will depend in part on our ability to form relationships with local partners. Our inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements for international sales of our products could impact our ability to maintain or increase international market demand for our products. In addition, many of the companies we compete against internationally have greater name recognition and a more substantial sales and marketing presence. Among the risks we believe are most likely to affect us with respect to our international operations are:\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements or in foreign policy, including adoption of domestic or foreign laws, regulations and interpretations detrimental to our business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, and longer payment cycles, especially in emerging markets;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of managing and staffing international offices and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in exchange rates;\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions, and continued economic uncertainty as a result of sovereign debt issues in Europe and Latin America;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers, import/export controls, and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022\ncertification requirements;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nlocal laws and practices that favor local companies, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nOur international operations are subject to increasingly complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act and equivalent laws in other jurisdictions, antitrust or competition laws, and data privacy laws, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Additionally, the costs of complying with these laws, including the costs of investigations, auditing and monitoring, could also adversely affect our current or future business.\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, adversely affecting our business, operating results and financial condition.\nProduct performance problems, including undetected errors in our hardware or software, could cause us to incur additional expenses and harm our business and reputation.\nOur products are highly technical and complex and when deployed, they are critical to our customers. Our products have contained and may contain undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by service providers. In particular, in a submarine cable network, any errors that are detected after deployment can be extremely costly and time consuming to correct. In addition, because we outsource the manufacturing of certain components of our products, we may also be subject to product performance problems as a result of the acts or omissions of third parties. Any errors or defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty, including claims relating to changes to our products made by our system integrators or distributors. Our contracts with customers generally contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may be ineffective, and provisions requiring us to indemnify our customers for product failures. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention away from the business and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our solutions. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to adequately expand our direct sales force with qualified and productive personnel, we may not be able to grow our business effectively.\nWe primarily sell our products through our direct sales force. To grow our business, we intend to focus on growing our customer base for the foreseeable future. Our ability to add customers and to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend upon our ability to grow and develop our direct sales force and on their ability to productively sell our products. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our solutions require significant time, expense and attention. The amount of time it takes for our sales representatives to be fully trained and to become productive varies widely. If our sales organization does not perform as expected, our revenue could suffer. In addition, if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel, if our sales force becomes less efficient as it grows or if new sales representatives are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to grow our customer base and revenue and our sales and marketing expenses may increase.\nWe might not be able to continue as a going concern absent our ability to raise additional equity or debt capital.\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which contemplate that we will continue to operate as a going concern. Our financial statements do not contain any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern will be determined by our ability to fund our expansion plans and realize our business objectives. We have had recurring operating losses and negative cash\nflows from operations since inception, and we may continue to generate operating losses and consume cash resources in the future. If we are unable to grow our revenue substantially to achieve and sustain profitability, or if we are unable to obtain adequate funding in the future, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nOur customers include departments and agencies of the U.S. and international governments. To the extent those relationships are not positively maintained or such contracts are not renewed or extended, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have in the past and may in the future sell our solutions to various departments and agencies of the U.S. and international governments. The revenue associated with these customers may be significant in any given period. Future general political and economic conditions, which cannot be accurately predicted, may directly and indirectly affect the quantity and allocation of expenditures by these federal or international departments and agencies. Any reductions or reallocations in the budgets for these government entities could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Obtaining government contracts may also involve long purchase and payment cycles, competitive bidding, qualification requirements, delays or changes in funding, budgetary constraints, political agendas, extensive specification development, price negotiations and milestone requirements. If our relationships with these governmental customers deteriorates, if we were to lose one or more of these customers or if we are subject to unanticipated changes or delays in contract performance with these customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled personnel that we need to support our business.\nOur future depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key technical personnel, each of whom would be difficult to replace. Our industry has experienced periods of intense competition for highly skilled technical personnel. During such periods it may be difficult to identify and hire qualified personnel in many critical areas of our business. Further, we may not be able to hire and retain such personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Many of the companies with which we compete for hiring experienced employees have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to retain our current management team or our employees, we could incur significant expenses replacing employees and the quality of our products and services and our ability to provide such products and services could be impaired, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to manage future growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\nWe have expanded our operations significantly since inception and anticipate that further expansion will be required. The growth of our business has placed significant demands on our management, as well as our financial and operational resources. If we do not effectively manage our future growth, the efficiency of our operations and the quality of our products could suffer, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. To effectively manage this growth, we will need to continue to:\n\u2022\nimplement appropriate operational, financial and management controls, systems and procedures, including continued implementation of our enterprise-wide financial system;\n\u2022\nexpand our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and capabilities; and\n\u2022\nprovide adequate training and supervision to maintain high quality standards.\nCompliance with environmental matters and worker health and safety laws could be costly, and noncompliance with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, expenses and financial condition.\nSome of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products. We could be subject to increased costs, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims if we violate or become liable under environmental or worker health and safety laws.\nExamples of these laws and regulations include the European Union, or EU, Restrictions of Hazardous Substances Directive, or the RoHS Directive, and the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, or the WEEE Directive, as well as the implementing legislation of the EU member states. Similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in China, South Korea, Norway and Japan and may be enacted in other regions, including in the United States. The RoHS Directive and the similar\nlaws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead, mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment, including our products. The WEEE Directive requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection, recycling and treatment of such products. If we fail to comply with these directives, we may suffer a loss of revenue, be unable to sell our products in certain markets and countries, be subject to penalties and fines or suffer a competitive disadvantage. In addition, the scope of any new legislation with respect to currently unregulated substances is uncertain. Costs to comply with WEEE or RoHS related legislation or similar future legislation, if applicable, could include costs associated with modifying our products, recycling and other waste processing costs, legal and regulatory costs and insurance costs. The costs to comply with current and future environmental and worker health and safety laws may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, expenses and financial condition.\nWe are subject to government regulations that could adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to export control laws that limit which products we sell and where and to whom we sell our products. U.S. export control laws also limit our ability to conduct product development activities in certain countries. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technologies and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in import and export regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the import and export of our products to certain countries altogether. Any change in import and export regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. In addition, our product or manufacturing standards could also be impacted by new or revised environmental rules and regulations or other social initiatives. Failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely basis, or at all, decreased use of our products or any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has jurisdiction over the entire U.S. communications industry and, as a result, our products and our U.S. customers are subject to FCC rules and regulations. Current and future FCC regulations affecting communications services, our products or our customers\u2019 businesses could negatively affect our business. In addition, international regulatory standards could impair our ability to develop products for international customers in the future. Delays caused by our compliance with regulatory requirements could result in postponements or cancellations of product orders. Further, we may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining any regulatory approvals that may, in the future, be required to operate our business. Any failure to obtain such approvals could harm our business and operating results.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products.\nAs a public company, we are subject to requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that require us to diligence, disclose and report whether or not our products contain conflict minerals. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of the materials used in our products. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. It is also possible that we may face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to alter our products, processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. If we are unable to satisfy customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free, these customers may discontinue or materially reduce purchases of our products, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are not able to integrate future acquisitions successfully, our operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nWe have made strategic acquisitions of businesses, technologies and other assets in the past, and may continue to make acquisitions in the future. The success of our acquisitions will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions and, if necessary, to obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing to fund those acquisitions. If we finance an acquisition with debt financing, we will incur interest expense and may have to comply with financing covenants or secure that debt obligation with our assets. Further, mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky, and any mergers and acquisitions we complete may not be successful. Any mergers and acquisitions we do would involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating and managing the operations, technologies and products of the companies we acquire;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our business;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nuncertainty of entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nour dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and partners of the companies we acquire;\n\u2022\nchallenges in integrating and auditing the financial statements of acquired companies that have not historically prepared financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles;\n\u2022\nimpairment of goodwill or other intangible assets such as trademarks or other intellectual property arising from acquisitions;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenue to offset our increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated revenue;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain internal standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the companies we acquire.\nSecurity incidents, such as data breaches and cyber-attacks, could compromise our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential information and cause significant damage to our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including data related to our intellectual property and data related to our business and that of our customers and business partners that is considered proprietary or confidential information. We believe that companies in the technology industry have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. While the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation, our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such security incidents or data breaches and the damage caused as a result. Accordingly, a data breach, cyber-attack, or unauthorized access or disclosure of our information could compromise our intellectual property and reveal proprietary or confidential business information. In addition, these security incidents could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs and expenses, disrupt key business operations, subject us to liability and divert attention of management and key information technology resources, any of which could cause significant harm to our business and reputation.\nAny future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nWe may become subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes or employment claims made by our current or former employees. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which might seriously harm our business, overall financial condition and operating results. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby harming our operating results and financial condition.\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations.\nA terrorist attack aimed at our nation\u2019s energy or telecommunications infrastructure could hinder or delay the development and sale of our products. In the event that an earthquake, terrorist attack or other man-made or natural catastrophe were to destroy any part\nof our facilities, or certain of our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities, destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time, our business, financial condition and operating results would be harmed.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 and Section 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income, and tax credits to offset tax. Future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Code, which could limit our ability to utilize our NOLs and tax credits. Our net operating losses and tax credits could also be impaired under state laws. As a result, we might not be able to utilize a material portion of our state NOLs and tax credits.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could incur significant expense to enforce our rights.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the United States. This is likely to become an increasingly important issue as we expand our operations and product development into countries that provide a lower level of intellectual property protection. In addition, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims, and even if patents are issued, they may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with a competitive advantage, and, as with any technology, competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our products, trademarks and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult, time consuming and, in some cases, impossible. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation, whether or not resolved in our favor, could result in substantial cost and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Such litigation could also provoke third parties to assert counterclaims against us, which could result in our need to license our intellectual property to competitors. An adverse decision in such litigation could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property, and could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights, limit the value of our technology or otherwise negatively impact our business. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nClaims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could harm our business.\nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents. In particular, many leading companies in the optical networking industry, including our competitors, have extensive patent portfolios with respect to optical communications technology. We expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps in patented technology occur. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. From time to time, third parties may assert exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are important to our business or seek to invalidate the proprietary rights that we hold. Competitors may assert claims or initiate litigation or other proceedings against us or our manufacturers, suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights, or seeking to invalidate our proprietary rights, with respect to our products and technology. In the event that we are unsuccessful in defending against any such claims, or any resulting lawsuit or proceedings, we could incur liability for damages and/or have valuable proprietary rights invalidated.\nAny claim of infringement from a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claims, and could distract our management from running our business. Furthermore, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. A judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering a particular product. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which would require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any\nof these events could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Competitors and other third parties have and may continue to assert infringement claims against our customers and sales partners. Any of these claims would require us to initiate or defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf, regardless of the merits of these claims, because we generally indemnify our customers and sales partners from claims of infringement of proprietary rights of third parties. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or sales partners, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our unpatented proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how. We generally seek to protect this information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the availability of licenses for intellectual property from third parties, and if these licenses are not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, product sales and development may be delayed.\nWe depend on an exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications owned by the Regents of the University of Michigan for use in the telecommunications, data communications, computer and data processing industries. This license is revocable in the event that we cease to do business, fail to make the royalty payments due thereunder or commit a material breach of the agreement that is not cured within 60 days of receiving written notice thereof. In such an event, our ability to compete in the market may be diminished.\nWe also incorporate certain other third-party technologies, including software programs, into our products and may need to utilize additional third-party technologies in the future. However, licenses to relevant third-party technology may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, we could face delays in product releases or be unable to make changes to our products until alternative technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our current products. These delays or an inability to make changes to our products, if they occur, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The inability to obtain certain licenses to third-party technology, or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license agreements and related intellectual property issues, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the risk factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other factors beyond our control. Furthermore, our common stock has limited trading history, and the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of customers;\n\u2022\nany major changes in our board of directors or senior management;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by our directors and executive officers or other sales of large blocks of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports or news stories about us, our competitors, or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by security analysis;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC; and\n\u2022\nadoption or modification of regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or operating results. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Each of these factors, among others, could harm the value of your investment in our common stock. Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class action lawsuits filed against them. If a suit were filed against us, regardless of its merits or outcome, it could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nAs of December 1, 2015, we had 17,110,331 shares of common stock outstanding. The 5,000,000 shares sold in our initial public offering were freely tradeable immediately after the offering, subject in certain instances to lock-up agreements executed in connection with the offering. All remaining shares outstanding are currently restricted as a result of lock-up agreements with us or the underwriters of our initial public offering. The shares currently restricted as a result of lock-up agreements will be available for sale into the public market on May 11, 2016, subject in some cases to volume and other limitations. Needham & Company, LLC may, in its sole discretion, permit our officers, directors, employees and current stockholders who are subject to contractual lock-up agreements with the underwriters to sell shares prior to the expiration of such lock-up agreements. If our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after the contractual lock-up and other legal restrictions on resale lapse, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nSome of our existing stockholders have contractual demand or piggyback rights to require us to register with the SEC shares of our common stock. If we register these shares of common stock following the expiration of the lock-up agreements, the stockholders would be able to sell those shares freely in the public market.\nOn November 13, 2015, we registered 3,995,085 shares of our common stock that we have issued or may issue under our equity plans. With the registration of these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject, if applicable, to the lock-up agreements described above and in some cases, to volume and other limitations. As of December 1, 2015, there were stock options to purchase 836,574 shares of our common stock and unvested restricted stock units representing 0 shares of our common stock outstanding, as well as 67,418 shares subject to outstanding warrants, which will be eligible for sale in the public market upon exercise and to the extent permitted by Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act. If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock.\nInsiders continue to have substantial control over us, which may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control over us.\nAs of December 1, 2015, our directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 30% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control over us.\nThe issuance of additional stock in connection with acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.\nAs of December 1, 2015, we had an aggregate of 78,827,166 shares of common stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for issuance under our stock option plans or otherwise. We may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders. We intend to continue to actively pursue strategic acquisitions. We may pay for such acquisitions, partly or in full, through the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities. Any issuance of shares in connection with our acquisitions or otherwise or the exercise of stock options issued in connection with our acquisitions would dilute the percentage ownership held by current investors.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and, beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, provide a management report on our internal controls over financial reporting, which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm to the extent we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined by the JOBS Act. If we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404, if we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which apply to us, may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d convertible preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;\n\u2022\nrequire that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a supermajority stockholder vote;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, may be filled by a majority vote of directors then in office rather than by stockholders;\n\u2022\nprevent stockholders from calling special meetings; and\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe currently do not plan to declare cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our credit facilities currently restrict our ability to pay cash dividends while these facilities remain outstanding. For more information, see the section titled \u201cDividend Policy.\u201d Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit. There is no guarantee that the price of our common stock will ever exceed the price that you pay.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management are required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur when were a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Global Market impose additional requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased and we expect, will continue to increase, our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations, and the risks associated with our status as a public company, could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For example, we will not include all of the executive compensation related information that would be required in our periodic reports and proxy statements if we were not an emerging growth company. In addition, for so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:\n\u2022\nhave an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\ncomply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis); and\n\u2022\nsubmit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as \u201csay on pay\u201d and \u201csay on frequency.\u201d\nBecause of these exemptions and the other reduced disclosure obligations for emerging growth companies set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our stock may appear less attractive to investors and could cause our stock price to decline.\nAlthough we intend to rely on certain of the exemptions provided in the JOBS Act, the exact implications of the JOBS Act for us are still subject to interpretations and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies. Also, as our business grows, we may no longer satisfy the conditions of an emerging growth company. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenue of $1 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. We will be deemed a large accelerated filer on the first day of the fiscal year after the market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million, measured on March 31. If investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on certain of the JOBS Act exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to \u201copt in\u201d to such extended transition period. Therefore, we are electing to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may choose to not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result of such election, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies.", "PERMNO": 15858, "SIC": 3661, "TIC": "XCOMQ"}
