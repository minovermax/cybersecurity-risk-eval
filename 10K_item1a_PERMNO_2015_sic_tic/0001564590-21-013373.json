Risk Factors.\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. In connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Should any of these risks materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities. You should read these Risk Factors in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8.\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and we expect it to continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide, including workforces, liquidity, capital markets, consumer behavior, supply chains, and macroeconomic conditions, which in turn has materially impacted our business. While we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to impact our business in the near term, particularly in regions where we derive a significant amount of our revenue or profit or where our suppliers and customers are located, the extent and duration of the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operation is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and outside our control. These developments include the scope, duration and severity of the pandemic (including the possibility of further surges or variations of COVID-19), the timing and efficacy of the vaccination program in the U.S., further actions taken by governmental authorities, including future stimulus programs, in response to the pandemic and changing consumer and supplier behavior. It is also possible that the pandemic and its aftermath will lead to a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the U.S. economy. The current COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our industry and cause disruptions to our operations, including as a result of decreased demand for our products and services or disruption to our supply chain, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we have taken significant precautions to ensure the health and safety of our team members and customers throughout the pandemic, our operations could be disrupted if any of our employees or employees of our suppliers or customers were suspected or confirmed of having COVID-19 or other illnesses and such illness required us or our suppliers or customers to quarantine some or all such employees or disinfect our locations. Also, a number of our administrative employees are working remotely. Remote working may heighten cybersecurity, information security and operational risks and affect the productivity of our employees.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may continue to cause disruptions in our supply chain. The inability of our suppliers to meet our supply needs in a timely manner or our quality standards could cause delays to delivery date requirements of our customers. Such failures could result in the cancellation of orders, customers\u2019 refusal to accept deliveries, a reduction in purchase prices, and ultimately, termination of customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In that case, we may be required to seek alternative sources of materials or products. Although we believe that we can manage our exposure to these risks, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify such alternative materials or sources without delay or without greater cost to us. Our inability to identify and secure alternative sources of supply in this situation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy customer orders. While we have largely been able to manage these supply chain disruptions to date, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future.\nWe also have faced, and will continue to face, business interruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While only some of our locations were temporarily closed in the states or counties where construction activities were temporarily prohibited or where more broad business closures were mandated, we could be adversely affected if government authorities impose further mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on our operations. Even if such measures are not further implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic or when or how our business, financial conditions and results of operations will be impacted by it, including as a result of the recent deterioration in the U.S. economy and any related impact on the residential homebuilding industry, and based on the duration and scope, such impact could be material. Historically, in times of an economic recession, new home construction in the United States has slowed considerably. Any significant downturn in new home construction as a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial conditions and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe industry in which we operate is dependent upon the U.S. residential homebuilding industry, repair and remodel activity, the economy, the credit markets, and other important factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe building products supply and services industry in the United States is highly dependent on new home construction and the R&R market, which in turn are dependent upon a number of factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, wage rates, foreclosure rates, housing inventory levels, housing demand, the availability of land, local zoning and permitting processes, the availability of construction financing, skilled construction labor and the health of the economy and mortgage markets. Unfavorable changes in demographics, credit markets, consumer confidence, health care costs, housing affordability, housing inventory levels, a weakening of the national economy or of any regional or local economy in which we operate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes and adversely affect our businesses.\nWe also rely on home R&R activity. High unemployment levels, high mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates, lower home prices, limited availability of mortgage and home improvement financing, and significantly lower housing turnover may restrict consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items such as home improvement projects, and affect consumer confidence levels leading to reduced spending in the R&R end market. Furthermore, with even a slight decline in the economy, nationally or in any of the markets in which we operate, consumer preferences and purchasing practices and the strategies of our customers may adjust in a manner that could result in changes to the nature and prices of products demanded by the end consumer and our customers and could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our, and in particular RDS\u2019s, business is in the state of California. A slowdown in the economy or a decline in homebuilding activity in California, or the occurrence of a natural disaster, could have a disproportionately negative effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nA significant portion of RDS\u2019s business is in the state of California. In 2020 and 2019, we derived approximately 36% and 39%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenue, and RDS derived approximately 50% and 52%, respectively, of its net revenue, from customers in California, and we expect this trend to continue in the future. As such, we are more susceptible to adverse developments in California than competitors with more diversified operations or if RDS had a more geographically diverse business. A slowdown in California\u2019s economy, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and government responses thereto, a decline in the state\u2019s homebuilding activity, or the occurrence of a natural disaster within the state, such as an earthquake, wildfire, drought or mudslide, all of which could be made worse by climate change, or civil disturbance, could have a disproportionately negative effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur businesses are cyclical and significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions.\nThe building products supply and services industry is subject to cyclical market pressures. Demand for our products and services is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions over which we have no control, including changes in (i) the number of new home and commercial building construction starts, (ii) the production schedules of our homebuilder customers, (iii) short- and long-term interest rates, (iv) inflation, (v) employment levels and job and personal income growth, (vi) housing demand from population growth, household formation and other demographic changes, (vii) availability and pricing of mortgage financing for homebuyers and commercial financing for developers of multi-family homes and subcontractors, (viii) consumer confidence generally and the confidence of potential homebuyers in particular, (ix) U.S. and global financial and political system and credit market stability, (x) private party and government mortgage loan programs and federal and state regulation, oversight and legal action regarding lending, appraisal, foreclosure and short sale practices, (xi) federal and state personal income tax rates and provisions, including provisions for the deduction of mortgage loan interest payments, real estate taxes and other expenses, (xii) federal, state and local energy efficiency programs, regulations, codes and standards, or (xiii) general economic conditions in the markets in which we compete.\nUnfavorable changes in these conditions could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes, and adversely affect our businesses generally. Any deterioration in economic conditions or increased uncertainty regarding economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe building products supply and services industry is seasonal and affected by weather-related conditions.\nOur industry is seasonal. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can adversely affect our businesses and operations through a decline in both the use of our products and demand for our services. Although weather patterns affect our operating results throughout the year, our first and fourth quarters have historically been the most adversely affected by weather patterns in some of our markets, causing reduced construction activity. To the extent that severe weather conditions, such as unusually prolonged cold conditions, hurricanes, severe storms, earthquakes, floods, fires, droughts, other natural disasters or similar events occur in the markets in which we operate, construction or installation activity could be reduced, delayed or halted and our businesses may be adversely affected. Furthermore, climate change could increase the frequency and severity of these weather events.\nIn addition, the levels of fabrication, distribution, and installation of our products generally follow activity in the construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during the second half of the year typically result in higher activity and revenue levels during those periods. Markets in which we operate that are impacted by winter weather, such as snow storms and extended periods of rain, experience a slowdown in construction activity during the beginning and the end of each calendar year, and this winter slowdown contributes to traditionally lower sales in our first quarter.\nOur industry and the markets in which we operate are highly fragmented and competitive, and increased competitive pressure may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe building products supply and services industry is highly fragmented and competitive. We face significant competition from local, regional and national building materials chains, design centers, fabricators, and subcontractors, as well as from privately-owned single-site enterprises. Competition varies depending on product line, type of customer and geographic area. Any of these competitors may (i) foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, (ii) offer products and services that are deemed superior to ours, (iii) have the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost, (iv) install building products at a lower cost, (v) develop stronger relationships with suppliers, fabricators, homebuilders, and other customers in our markets, (vi) develop a superior network of distribution centers in our markets, (vii) adapt more quickly to new technologies, new installation techniques, or evolving customer requirements, or (viii) have access to financing on more favorable terms than we can obtain. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors. If we are unable to compete effectively with our existing competitors or new competitors enter the markets in which we operate, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to warranty, casualty, construction defect, contract, tort, employment and other claims, and legal proceedings related to our businesses, the products we distribute, the services we provide, and services provided for us by third parties.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims and litigation. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources. As a subcontractor, we are regularly subject to construction defect claims on various housing tracts. We may not always be able to successfully defend or be excused from the lawsuits related to these claims and could be subject to substantial losses.\nWe are also from time to time subject to casualty, contract, tort and other claims relating to our businesses, the products we have distributed in the past or may in the future distribute, and the services we have provided in the past or may in the future provide, either directly or through third parties. If any such claim were adversely determined, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected if we were unable to seek indemnification for such claims or were not adequately insured for such claims.\nIn addition, we are exposed to potential claims arising from the conduct of our employees, builders and their subcontractors, and third-party installers for which we may be liable. We and they are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of third-party installers. If we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nProduct shortages, loss of key suppliers or failure to develop relationships with qualified suppliers, our dependence on third-party suppliers and manufacturers, or the development of alternatives to distributors in the supply chain, could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate product supply from manufacturers and other suppliers. Generally, our products are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities to meet our operating needs. However, the loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In prior downturns in the housing industry, manufacturers have reduced capacity by closing plants and production lines within plants. Even if such capacity reductions are not permanent, there may be a delay in manufacturers\u2019 ability to increase capacity in times of rising demand. If the demand for products from manufacturers and other suppliers exceeds the available supply, we may be unable to source additional products in sufficient quantity or quality in a timely manner and the prices for the products that we install could rise. These developments could affect our ability to take advantage of market opportunities and limit our growth prospects.\nOur ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers\u2019 non-compliance with applicable laws, tariffs and import duties, supply disruptions, shipping interruptions or costs, and other factors beyond our control, including disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAlthough in some instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party without notice or on limited notice. Many of our suppliers also offer us favorable terms based on the volume of our purchases. However, the failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on favorable terms, commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could put pressure on our operating margins or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, our larger customers, such as homebuilders, fabricators, and dealers, could begin purchasing more of their product needs directly from manufacturers, which would result in decreases in our net sales and earnings. Our suppliers could invest in infrastructure to expand their own sales forces and sell more products directly to our customers, which also would negatively impact our businesses. These changes in the supply chain could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA material disruption at one of our suppliers\u2019 facilities or loss of a supplier relationship could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and negatively affect our overall financial results.\nAny of the following events could cease or limit our or our suppliers\u2019 operations unexpectedly: fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, on-site or off-site environmental incidents or other catastrophes; utility and transportation infrastructure disruptions; labor difficulties; other operational problems; war, and acts of terrorism; pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and other global health crises; or other unexpected events. Any downtime or facility damage at our suppliers could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make more expensive purchases from a competing supplier. If our suppliers were to incur significant downtime, our ability to satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in customers seeking products from other distributors as well as decreased customer satisfaction and lower sales and operating income. In addition, a loss of a supplier relationship could harm our operations. Because we purchase from a limited number of suppliers, the effects of any particular shutdown or facility damage or loss of a supplier relationship could be significant to our operations.\nIn addition, our suppliers\u2019 inability to produce or procure the necessary raw materials to supply finished goods to us may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\nIf we fail to qualify for supplier rebates or are unable to maintain or adequately renegotiate our rebate arrangements, our gross margins and income could be adversely affected.\nMany of our products, such as flooring, tile and finish carpentry, are purchased pursuant to rebate arrangements that entitle us to receive a rebate based on the volume of our purchases. Such arrangements generally require us to purchase minimum quantities in certain geographies or product categories and result in higher rebates with increased quantities of purchases. These rebates effectively reduce the cost of our products and we manage our businesses to take advantage of these programs. When assessing the desirability of acquisitions, we consider the effects of such acquisitions on our ability to qualify for rebates. Rebate arrangements are subject to renegotiation with our suppliers from time to time. In addition, consolidation of suppliers may result in the reduction or elimination of rebate programs in which we participate. If we are unable to qualify for these rebates, are unable to renew rebate programs on desirable terms or are unable to obtain the expected rebate benefits of our acquisitions, or a supplier materially reduces or stops offering rebates, our costs could increase and our gross margins and income could be adversely affected.\nChanges in product mix or the costs of the products we install can decrease our profit margins.\nThe principal building products that we distribute and install have been subject to price changes in the past, some of which have been significant. Our operating results for individual quarterly periods can be, and have been, adversely affected by a delay between when building product cost increases are implemented and when we are able to increase prices for our products and services, if at all. Our supplier purchase prices often depend on volume requirements. If we do not meet these volume requirements, our costs could increase and our margins may be adversely affected. In addition, while we have been able to achieve cost savings through volume purchasing and our relationships with suppliers, we may not be able to continue to receive advantageous pricing for the products that we supply, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur profitability is also impacted by the mix of products that we install and sell. Recent trends indicate more of our homebuilder customers are moving to entry- to mid-level homes with fewer upgrades. There can be no assurance that the current product mix will continue, and any shift to options with lower profit margin could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nPolitical and economic uncertainty and unrest in foreign countries where our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operating results.\nA significant number of our suppliers are located in foreign countries and therefore, we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in these or other foreign countries in which we source, or in the future may source, any of our products, such as (i) increased import duties, tariffs, trade restrictions, and quotas, (ii) work stoppages, (iii) economic uncertainties (including inflation), (iv) adverse foreign government regulations, government control, or sudden changes in laws and regulations, (v) wars, fears of war, and terrorist attacks, (vi) pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and other global crises, and (vii) organizing activities and political unrest.\nWe cannot predict if, when, or the extent to which, the countries in which we source our products will experience any of the above events. Any event causing a disruption, delay or cessation of imports from foreign locations would likely increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us, and cause us to seek alternative sources for our products, which may only be available on less advantageous terms, and would adversely affect our operating results.\nThe importation of building materials into the United States could expose us to additional risk.\nA significant portion of the building materials that we distribute and/or install come from foreign jurisdictions outside North America. Such materials may be imported because they may not be available for domestic purchase in the United States or because there may be a shortfall of inventory available locally. Despite our efforts to ensure the merchantability of these products, such products may not adhere to U.S. standards or laws. In addition, pricing of these products can be impacted by changes to the relative value of the U.S. dollar over the applicable foreign currency in the long-term, which could negatively impact our margins. Importation of such building materials could subject us to greater risk, including currency risk, and lawsuits by customers or governmental entities.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage our inventory and working capital as our sales volume increases or the prices of the products we distribute fluctuate, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe purchase certain materials, including wood and laminate flooring, natural and engineered stone, and tile for wall and flooring applications, from manufacturers or quarries, which are then sold to customers as an installed product or as a prefabricated and installed product. We must maintain and have adequate working capital to purchase sufficient inventory to meet customer demand. Due to the lead times required by our suppliers, we order products in advance of expected sales. As a result, we are required to forecast our sales and purchase accordingly. In periods characterized by significant changes in economic growth and activity in the commercial and residential construction and home R&R end markets, it can be especially difficult to forecast our sales accurately. We must also manage our working capital to fund our inventory purchases. Excessive increases in the market prices of certain products can put negative pressure on our operating cash flows by requiring us to invest more in inventory. In the future, if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and working capital as we attempt to expand our\nbusinesses, or if we make changes to how we manage our payments to suppliers, our cash flows may be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to significant pricing pressures from homebuilders, contractors, fabricators, dealers and other customers.\nLarge homebuilders, contractors, fabricators, and dealers have historically been able to exert significant pressure on their outside suppliers and distributors to keep prices low in the highly fragmented building products supply and services industry. In addition, continued consolidation in the residential homebuilding industry and changes in builders\u2019 purchasing policies and payment practices could result in even further pricing pressure. For example, there has been a recent trend of large publicly-traded homebuilders acquiring other large homebuilders, which increases their market share and buying power. Our homebuilder customers may be acquired by other homebuilders that we do not currently have relationships with, which may make it difficult for us to maintain our current market share and margins. A decline in the selling prices of the products we distribute and the services we provide could adversely impact our operating results. To the extent that our inventory at the time was purchased at higher costs, this could result in lower margins. Alternatively, due to the rising market price environment, our suppliers may increase prices or reduce discounts on the products we distribute and we may be unable to pass on any cost increase to our customers, thereby resulting in reduced margins and profits.\nThe loss of any of our significant customers or a reduction in the quantity of products they purchase could affect our financial health.\nOur ten largest customers generated approximately 30% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. No one customer generated more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. We cannot guarantee that we will maintain or improve our relationships with these customers or that we will continue to supply these customers at historical levels.\nContinued consolidation among homebuilders could also result in a loss of some of our present customers to our competitors. The loss of one or more of our significant customers or deterioration in our existing relationships with any of our customers could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Furthermore, our customers are not required to purchase any minimum amount of product from us. Should our customers purchase the products we distribute or install in significantly lower quantities than they have in the past, or should the customers of any business that we acquire purchase products from us in significantly lower quantities than they had prior to our acquisition of such business, such decreased purchases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRDS\u2019s customers may be affected by shortages in labor supply, increased labor costs or labor disruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur customers require a qualified labor force to build homes and communities, and we require a qualified labor force to install our products in those homes. Access to qualified labor and subcontractors by our customers and us may be affected by circumstances beyond their or our control, including (i) shortages of qualified trades people, such as flooring, tile and cabinet installers, carpenters, roofers, electricians and plumbers, especially in key markets, (ii) changes in immigration laws and trends in labor force migration, and (iii) increases in subcontractor and professional services costs.\nLabor shortages can be further exacerbated if demand for housing increases. Any of these circumstances could also give rise to delays in the start or completion of, or could increase the cost of, building homes. Such delays and cost increases would also have an effect on our ability to generate sales from homebuyers and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur backlog estimates for our RDS segment may not be accurate and may not generate expected levels of future revenue or translate into profits.\nOur backlog estimates of potential future revenue for our RDS segment require substantial judgment and are based on a number of assumptions, including management\u2019s current assessment of customer contracts that exist as of the date the estimates are made and the expected revenue to be derived from sales related to remaining housing\nlots to be fulfilled under existing service agreements for active residential developments. A number of factors could result in actual revenue being less than the amounts reflected in our estimates, such as upgrade rates or upgrade amounts being lower than expected, or modification or cancellation of contracts by homebuilders. Actual rates and amounts may differ from historical experiences used to estimate potential future revenue. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will actually generate the specified revenue or that the actual revenue will be generated within the estimated period. If such revenue fails to materialize, we could experience a reduction in revenue and a decline in profitability, which could result in a deterioration of our financial position and liquidity.\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share.\nIt is difficult to accurately predict the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our businesses depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in demographics, consumer preferences, expectations, needs and weather conditions, while also managing inventory levels. In general, the products we sell are affected by style trends, customer preferences and changes thereto. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations, and building product needs could possibly result in obsolete or devalued inventory, and adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\nThe success of our businesses depends, in part, on our ability to execute on our growth strategy, which includes opening new branches and pursuing strategic acquisitions.\nOur long-term business strategy depends in part on increasing our sales and growing our market share through opening new branches, including through our greenfield initiatives, and strategic acquisitions. A significant portion of our historical growth has occurred through acquisitions, and our business plan provides for continued growth through acquisitions in the future. We are presently evaluating, and we expect to continue to evaluate on an ongoing basis, a variety of possible acquisition transactions, including both smaller and larger acquisitions. We cannot predict the timing of any contemplated transactions, and there can be no assurances that we will identify suitable acquisition opportunities or, if we do identify such opportunities, that any transaction can be consummated on acceptable terms. If such transactions are consummated on acceptable terms, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired business into our existing business or may not be able to do so in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner. Our inability to complete the integration of new businesses in a timely and orderly manner could increase costs and lower profits. In addition, our recent growth and our acquisition strategy have placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management\u2019s time, which may divert their attention from our businesses, and may lead to significant due diligence and other expenses regardless of whether we pursue or consummate any acquisition. Failure to identify suitable transaction partners and to consummate transactions on acceptable terms, as well as the commitment of time and resources in connection with such transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, we may not be able to finance acquisitions through acceptable financing terms or at all.\nWe may not be able to expand into new geographic markets, which may impact our ability to grow our businesses.\nWe intend to continue to pursue our growth strategy to expand into new geographic markets for the foreseeable future. Our expansion into new geographic markets may present competitive, distribution and other challenges that differ from the challenges we currently face. In addition, we may be less familiar with the customers in these markets and may ultimately face different or additional risks, as well as increased or unexpected costs, compared to those we experience in our existing markets. We may also be unfamiliar with the labor force in these markets and may have difficulty finding and retaining necessary skilled or qualified workers on acceptable terms, or at all. Expansion into new geographic markets may also expose us to direct competition with companies with whom we have limited or no past experience as competitors. Furthermore, some of our customer and supplier agreements may restrict the markets where we are able to distribute certain products, and these limitations could negatively impact our ability to achieve success in new markets. To the extent we rely upon expanding into new geographic markets and do not meet, or are unprepared for, any new challenges posed by such expansion, our future sales growth could be negatively impacted, our operating costs could increase, and our businesses, operations, and financial results could be negatively affected.\nWe occupy many of our facilities under long-term non-cancellable leases, and we may be unable to renew our leases at the end of their terms.\nMany of our facilities and distribution centers are located on leased premises. Many of our current leases are non-cancellable and typically have initial terms ranging from one to 12 years, and most provide options to renew for specified periods of time. If we close or idle a facility, we would most likely remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which would include, among other things, payment of the base rent, insurance, taxes and other expenses on the leased property for the balance of the lease term. In some circumstances when idling a facility, we may attempt to sublease a facility to assist in partially offsetting these non-cancellable lease costs. The inability to terminate leases when idling a facility or exiting a geographic market can have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a facility, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. In addition, we may not be able to secure a replacement facility in a location that is as commercially viable as the lease we are unable to renew and we may incur substantial costs with respect to such a replacement facility. Additionally, the net revenue and profit, if any, generated at a relocated facility may not equal the net revenue and profit generated at the existing one.\nNatural or man-made disruptions to our facilities may adversely affect our businesses and operations.\nWe currently maintain a broad network of distribution facilities throughout the United States. Any widespread disruption to our facilities or those of our suppliers resulting from fire, earthquake, weather-related events, an act of terrorism or any other cause could damage a significant portion of our facilities and inventory and could materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers. We could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers during the time that it takes for us to reopen or replace a damaged facility. In addition, any shortages of fuel or significant fuel cost increases could disrupt our ability to distribute products to our customers. Disruptions to the national or local transportation infrastructure systems, including those related to a domestic terrorist attack, may also affect our ability to keep our operations and services functioning properly. If any of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nThe implementation of new initiatives related to our operating software systems and related technology could disrupt our operations, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.\nWe have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our operating software systems and related technology. These initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our employees to continue to provide high quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected purchasing experience. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. In the event that we continue to grow, there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep up, expand or adapt our IT infrastructure to meet evolving demand on a timely basis and at a commercially reasonable cost, or at all. In addition, our new and upgraded technology might cost more than anticipated or might not provide the anticipated benefits, or it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the initiatives might fail altogether. Because the success of our growth strategy depends in part on our IT infrastructure, problems with any related initiatives may adversely affect our businesses, operations, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks, and a disruption or breach of our IT systems could adversely impact our businesses and operations.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our IT systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third parties, and our ability to continually update these systems in response to the changing needs of our businesses. We have incurred costs and may incur significant additional costs in order to implement security measures that we feel are appropriate to protect our IT systems. Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, natural or man-made disasters, unauthorized access, cyberattacks and other similar disruptions. Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to\nattacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any attacks on our IT systems could result in our systems or data being breached or damaged by computer viruses or unauthorized physical or electronic access, which could lead to delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders, and adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Such a breach could result in not only business disruption, but also theft of our intellectual property or other competitive information or unauthorized access to controlled data and any personal information stored in our IT systems. To the extent that any data is lost or destroyed, or any confidential information is inappropriately disclosed or used, it could adversely affect our competitive position or customer relationships. In addition, any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our businesses, products and services, which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nAs cyber-attacks become more sophisticated generally, we may be required to incur significant costs to strengthen our systems from outside intrusions and/or maintain insurance coverage related to the threat of such attacks. While we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our IT, they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks, or other security breaches to our computer systems.\nRDS\u2019s business and results of operations are significantly dependent on the availability and skill of subcontractors.\nWe engage subcontractors to perform the installation of the products that we sell to our customers. Accordingly, the timing and quality of our installations depends on the availability and skill of our subcontractors. While we believe that our relationships with subcontractors are good, we generally do not have long-term contractual commitments with any subcontractors, and we can provide no assurance that skilled subcontractors will continue to be available at reasonable rates in our markets. The inability to contract with skilled subcontractors at reasonable rates and on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMoreover, despite our quality control efforts, we may discover that our subcontractors have failed to adhere to proper construction practices or improperly installed materials in the homes of our customers. The adverse costs of satisfying our warranty and other legal obligations in these instances may be significant and we may be unable to recover the costs of warranty-related repairs from subcontractors, suppliers and insurers, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf any of RDS\u2019s subcontractors are characterized as employees, we would be subject to employment and withholding liabilities.\nWe structure our relationships with our subcontractors in a manner that we believe results in an independent contractor relationship, not an employee relationship. An independent contractor is generally distinguished from an employee by his or her degree of autonomy and independence in providing services. A high degree of autonomy and independence is generally indicative of a contractor relationship, while a high degree of control is generally indicative of an employment relationship. Although we believe that our subcontractors are properly characterized as independent contractors, tax or other regulatory authorities may in the future challenge our characterization of these relationships. If such regulatory authorities or state, federal or foreign courts were to determine that our subcontractors are employees, and not independent contractors, we would be required to withhold income taxes, to withhold and pay social security, Medicare and similar taxes, and to pay unemployment and other related payroll taxes. We would also be liable for unpaid past taxes and subject to penalties. As a result, any determination that these subcontractors are employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations\nFinancial and Liquidity Risks\nWe may use additional leverage in executing our business strategy, which may adversely affect our businesses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the principal amount of our total indebtedness was approximately $170.7 million, consisting of (i) $9.9 million under the SIC revolving credit facility, (ii) $152.8 million under the ASG term loan, and (iii) $8.1 million of vehicle and equipment loans and capital leases. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, there was also $0.6 million of outstanding letters of credit. We had the ability to access approximately $67.4 million of unused borrowings available under the SIC revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2020, and, as part of our growth strategy, we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future. Our existing indebtedness is recourse to us and we anticipate that future indebtedness will likewise be recourse. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risk that we now face could intensify.\nOur board of directors will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the purchase price of assets to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and our company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. As a means of sustaining our long-term financial health and limiting our exposure to unforeseen dislocations in the debt and financing markets, we currently expect to remain conservatively capitalized; however, our charter does not contain a limitation on the amount of debt we may incur and our board of directors may change our target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders.\nIncurring a substantial amount of debt could have important consequences for our businesses, including (i) making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt or to our trade or other creditors, (ii) increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, (iii) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited, (iv) requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate requirements, (v) limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, and (vi) placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.\nWe cannot assure you that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us through capital markets financings or under our credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness that we will incur on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to finance our operations or to repay our indebtedness. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional debt or equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. We cannot assure you that any such actions, if necessary, could be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future financing arrangements.\nOur current financing arrangements contain, and our future financing arrangements likely will contain, restrictive covenants relating to our operations.\nOur current financing arrangements contain, and the financing arrangements we enter into in the future likely will contain, covenants (financial and otherwise) affecting our ability to incur additional debt, incur liens, make certain investments, sell our shares, reduce liquidity below certain levels, make distributions to our stockholders and otherwise affect our operating policies. The restrictions contained in our financing arrangements could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants in our financing arrangements, we would be in default under these arrangements, and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable, terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their respective interests against existing collateral. In addition, our financing arrangements may contain cross-default provisions. As a result, if we default in our payment or performance obligations under one of our financing arrangements and, in some cases, if the amount due thereunder is accelerated, other financing arrangements, if any, may be declared in default and accelerated even though we are meeting payment and performance obligations on those other arrangements. If this occurs, we may not have sufficient available cash to pay all amounts that are then due and payable under our financing arrangements, and we may have to seek additional debt or equity financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms. If alternative financing is not available, we may have to curtail our investment activities and/or sell assets in order to obtain the funds required to make the accelerated payments or seek ways to restructure the loan obligations. If we default on several of our financing arrangements or any single significant financing arrangement, it could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nInterest expense on debt we will incur may limit our cash available to fund our growth strategies.\nOur current financing arrangements have, and any additional debt we subsequently incur may have, a floating rate of interest. Higher interest rates could increase debt service requirements on our current floating rate debt and on any floating rate debt we subsequently incur, and could reduce funds available for operations, future business opportunities or other purposes. If we need to repay debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to refinance our then-existing debt on unfavorable terms or liquidate one or more of our assets to repay such debt at times which may not permit realization of the maximum return on such assets and could result in a loss. The occurrence of either or both of such events could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nWe may require additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us.\nThe expansion and development of our businesses may require significant capital, which we may be unable to obtain, to fund our capital expenditures, operating expenses, working capital needs, and potential strategic acquisitions. In accordance with our growth strategy, we may opportunistically raise additional debt capital to help fund the growth of our businesses, subject to market and other conditions, but such debt capital may not be available to us on a timely basis, or at all, to meet our cash requirements. Further, our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenue does not reach expected levels or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated or we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities.\nTo a large extent, our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot assure you that our businesses will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before its maturity or obtain additional equity or debt financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow, refinance our debt or incur additional debt on favorable terms could adversely affect our financial condition and could cause us to be unable to service our debt and may delay or prevent the expansion of our businesses.\nA significant decline in the general economy or the new home construction or R&R markets, and/or a deterioration in expectations regarding the homebuilding market, could cause us to record significant non-cash impairment charges, which could negatively affect our earnings and reduce stockholders\u2019 equity.\nA significant decline in the general economy or the new home construction or R&R markets, and/or a deterioration in expectations regarding the homebuilding market, could cause us to record significant non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill or other long-lived assets, which are not determinable at this time and which could negatively affect our earnings and reduce stockholders\u2019 equity. In addition, as a result of our acquisition strategy, we have recorded goodwill and may incur impairment charges in connection with prior and future acquisitions. If the value of goodwill or other intangible assets is impaired, our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity would be adversely affected.\nOrganizational and Structural Risks\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between the Company and its stockholders, which could increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit the ability of the Company\u2019s stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, (iv) civil action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the provisions of our charter or our bylaws, or (v) action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Company\u2019s amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. The exclusive forum provision in the Company\u2019s amended and restated bylaws will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our Class A Common Stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to as the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, a requirement to present only two years of audited financial statements in the registration statement for the emerging growth company\u2019s initial public offering of common equity securities, an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (which we refer to as the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies, no requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements and not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. Although under the JOBS Act we are exempt from such disclosure requirements, we are required, among other things, to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or if, in the future, we identify other control deficiencies or material weaknesses in our accounting and financial reporting processes, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A Common Stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to litigations or investigations by the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market or other regulatory authorities, or derivative or securities lawsuits from shareholders, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nSection 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nOperation on multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (which we refer to as \u201cERP\u201d) information systems may negatively impact our operations.\nWe are highly dependent on our information systems infrastructure to process orders, purchase materials, track inventory, ship products in a timely manner, prepare invoices to our customers, maintain internal controls, produce financial data, and otherwise carry on our businesses in the ordinary course. Our RDS segment is continuing to implement a system that will further enhance its ability to scale rapidly. While we believe we have the experience, skill and management abilities, as well as access to the necessary experts and consultants, to plan and execute these projects without significant disruption to our businesses, ERP implementations and conversions are very complex and inherently subject to risks and uncertainty. There is no assurance that the projects will succeed or that failures in the design, programming, software or implementation of these projects will not cause significant disruption to our businesses. Such a disruption could cause project cost overruns, which may be significant, losses in revenue, increases in operating costs, and reduced customer satisfaction, all of which would lead to a decline in profitability over the short term and possibly the long term. In addition, as the Company continues to pursue inorganic growth opportunities through acquisitions, our ability to integrate newly acquired businesses onto our existing ERP systems is critical to maximizing the value and realizing the synergies of those newly acquired businesses into our existing segments.\nGeneral Risks\nA trading market for our Class A Common Stock may not be sustained and our Class A Common Stock prices could decline.\nAlthough our Class A Common Stock is currently listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cSIC,\u201d an active trading market for the shares of our Class A Common Stock may not be sustained. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to (i) the likelihood that an active trading market for shares of our Class A Common Stock will be sustained, (ii) the liquidity of any such market, (iii) the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares of Class A Common Stock, or (iv) the price that our stockholders may obtain for their Class A Common Stock.\nIn addition, the securities markets in general and our Class A Common Stock have experienced price and volume volatility over the past year. The market price and volume of our Class A Common Stock may continue to experience fluctuations not only due to general stock market conditions but also due to government regulatory action, tax laws, interest rates and a change in sentiment in the market regarding our industry, operations or business prospects. In addition to the other risk factors discussed in this section, the price and volume volatility of our Class A Common Stock may be affected by (i) actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results, (ii) changes in market valuations of similar companies, (iii) adverse market reaction to the level of our indebtedness, (iv) additions or departures of key personnel, (v) actions by stockholders (vi) speculation in the press or investment\ncommunity, (vii) negative publicity regarding us specifically or our businesses generally, (viii) general market, economic and political conditions, including an economic slowdown or dislocation in the global credit markets, (ix) our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies, (x) changes in accounting principles, (xi) passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or the building products supply and services industry, or (xii) inaccurate or unfavorable research or reports about the Company published by securities or industry analysts, or the cessation of coverage or regular reports by such analysts.\nIf an active market is not maintained, or if our Class A Common Stock continues to experience price and volume volatility, the market price of our Class A Common Stock may decline.\nChanges in legislation and government policy may have a material adverse effect on our businesses in the future.\nDynamic changes in legislation and government policy may have a material adverse effect on our business. Specifically, with the new Biden presidential administration, proposed legislation and regulatory changes could have a material impact on us including, but not limited to, modifications to international trade policy and increased regulation. Furthermore, existing tariffs imposed on goods imported from abroad that are used in our businesses may be removed by executive order or expanded upon the action of President Biden. Similarly, the uncertain geopolitical relationships between the United States and other countries, including India, Turkey, Spain, Vietnam, the European Union, and China could result in additional disruptions impacting the operations of the Company.\nIn addition, actions before the U.S. Department of Commerce (which we refer to as the \u201cDOC\u201d) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (which we refer to as the \u201cITC\u201d) continue to present risk to the operations of the Company. A risk exists that additional future actions before the ITC and DOC could disrupt the operations of the Company.\nWe are currently unable to predict the extent of the changes to existing legislative and regulatory environments relevant to our businesses, or how those and potential future changes would impact our businesses. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on us or the industries we serve, including the imposition of additional duties or tariffs discussed above or otherwise, these changes may materially and adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe depend on key personnel and our inability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled employees could adversely affect our businesses.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of certain key personnel and other members of our management team, each of whom would be difficult to replace. Further, the process of attracting and retaining suitable replacements for key personnel whose services we may lose would result in transition costs and would divert the attention of other members of our senior management from our existing operations. The loss of services from key personnel or a limitation in their availability could materially and adversely impact our businesses, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, in executing our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, such as build tradesmen for finish carpentry and for installation of tile, flooring and cabinets. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than us. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our businesses and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, the employment agreements we have with many of our senior level executives contain severance obligations which may require us to pay significant amounts of severance compensation to such employees upon the termination of their employment under certain circumstances.", "PERMNO": 18055, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "SIC"}
