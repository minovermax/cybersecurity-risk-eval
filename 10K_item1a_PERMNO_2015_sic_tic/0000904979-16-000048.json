In addition to the various risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered. The Company's business could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial to its operations.\nRisks Related to the Company's Business\nA downturn in the global economy could harm demand for passenger cars and commercial vehicles that are manufactured with the Company's products and, therefore, could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe level of demand for the Company's products depends primarily upon the level of consumer demand for new vehicles that are manufactured with its products. The global economic recession that began in 2008 had a significant adverse effect on the Company's business, customers and suppliers, and contributed to delayed and reduced purchases of passenger cars and commercial vehicles, including those manufactured with its products. Demand for and pricing of its products is also subject to economic conditions and other factors (e.g., energy costs, fuel costs, climate change concerns, vehicle age, consumer spending and preferences, materials used in production, commodity prices and changing technology) present in the various domestic and international markets in which its products are sold. If the global economy were to experience another significant downturn, depending upon its length, duration and severity, or any other event that results in a reduction of demand for automobiles, the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nDeterioration in the United States and world economies could harm the Company's customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to access the capital markets, which may affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the Company's customers and suppliers by making it increasingly difficult for them to obtain financing for their businesses and for their customers to obtain financing for automobile purchases. The Company's OEM customers typically require significant financing for their respective businesses. This financing often comes from securitization markets, which experience severe disruptions during global economic crises. The Company's suppliers, as well as its customers\u2019 suppliers, may face similar difficulties in obtaining financing for their businesses. If capital is not available to the Company's customers or suppliers, or if the cost of capital is prohibitively high, their businesses would be adversely affected, which could result in their restructuring or even reorganization or liquidation under applicable bankruptcy laws. Any such adverse effect on its customers or suppliers could materially adversely affect the Company, either through loss of revenues from any of its customers so affected, or due to its inability to meet its commitments without excess expense, as a result of disruptions in supply caused by the suppliers so affected. Financial difficulties experienced by any of the Company's major customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company if such customer were unable to pay for the products the Company provides or if the Company experienced a loss of, or material reduction in, business from such customer. As a result of such difficulties, the Company could experience lost revenues, significant write-offs of accounts receivable, significant impairment charges, or additional restructurings. In addition, severe financial or other difficulties at any of the Company's major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company if the Company is unable to obtain on a timely basis and on similar economic terms the quantity and quality of components the Company requires to produce products.\nMoreover, severe financial or operating difficulties at any automotive vehicle manufacturer or other significant supplier could have a significant disruptive effect on the entire industry, leading to supply chain disruptions and labor unrest, among other things. These disruptions could force OEMs and, in turn, other suppliers, including us, to shut down or reduce production at plants.\nThe Company's inability to obtain and maintain sufficient capital financing may harm the liquidity and financial condition of the Company.\nThe Company's working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending, in part, on the level, variability and timing of the Company's customers' production and the payment terms the Company has with its customers and suppliers. The Company's liquidity could be adversely affected if the Company's suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or payment on delivery. If the Company's available cash flows from operations is not sufficient to fund its ongoing cash needs, the Company would likely look to its cash balances and borrowing availability under its Credit Agreement (as defined below) to satisfy those needs. The Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement on October 30, 2015, which, among other things, increased the permitted leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to satisfy the financial covenants currently under the Credit Agreement, that it will be able to\nenter into favorable amendments in the future, that alternative sources of additional capital will be available on satisfactory terms or at all or that it will otherwise continue to have the ability to maintain sufficient capital financing. Insufficient liquidity may increase the risk of not being able to produce products or having to pay higher prices for inputs that may not be recovered in selling prices.\nThe Company may pursue acquisitions or strategic alliances that the Company may not successfully integrate or that may divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe Company may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances in the future. However, the Company may not be able to identify and secure suitable opportunities. The Company's ability to consummate and integrate effectively any future acquisitions or enter into strategic alliances on terms that are favorable to the Company may be limited by a number of factors, such as competition for attractive targets and, to the extent necessary, its ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nIn addition, if a potential acquisition target, joint venture, or strategic alliance candidate is identified, the Company may fail to enter into a definitive agreement for the candidate on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The negotiation and completion of potential acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances, whether or not ultimately consummated, could also require significant diversion of management\u2019s time and resources and potential disruption of existing business. The expected synergies and cost savings from acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances may not be realized and the Company may not achieve the expected results, including the synergies and cost savings the Company expects to realize in connection with the FMS Acquisition and the Radar Acquisition (each as defined below). The Company may also have to incur significant charges in connection with future acquisitions. Future acquisitions or strategic alliances could also potentially result in the incurrence of additional indebtedness, dilutive issuance of equity securities, costs and contingent liabilities. The Company may also have to obtain approvals and licenses from the relevant government authorities for such transactions to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, which could result in increased costs and delay. Future strategic alliances or acquisitions may expose the Company to additional potential risks, including risks associated with:\n\u2022\nuncertainties in assessing the value, strengths and potential profitability of, and identifying the extent of all weaknesses, risks and contingent and other liabilities of, acquisition targets or other transaction candidates;\n\u2022\nthe Company's inability to generate sufficient revenue to recover costs and expenses of the strategic alliances or acquisitions;\n\u2022\npotential loss of, or harm to, relationships with employees, customers and suppliers; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in business, industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition rationale.\nAny of the above risks could significantly impair the Company's ability to manage its business and materially harm its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may be unable to realize revenues represented by awarded business, which could materially harm the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe realization of future revenues from awarded business is subject to risks and uncertainties, including the number of vehicles that the Company's customers will actually produce, the timing of that production and the mix of options that its customers may choose.\nIn addition to not having a commitment from the Company's customers regarding the minimum number of products they must purchase from the Company if it obtains awarded business, the terms and conditions of the agreements with the Company's customers typically provide that they have the contractual right to unilaterally terminate its contracts with only limited notice. If such contracts are terminated by its customers, the Company's ability to obtain compensation from its customers for such termination is generally limited to the direct out-of-pocket costs that the Company incurred for inventory and not fully reimbursed tooling, and in certain rare instances, not fully depreciated capital expenditures.\nThe Company bases a substantial part of planning on the anticipated lifetime revenues of particular products. The Company calculates the lifetime revenues of a product by multiplying its expected price for a product by the forecasted production volume for that product during the length of time the Company expects the related vehicle to be in production. The Company uses third-party forecasting services to provide long-term forecasts, which allow the Company to determine how long a vehicle is expected to be in production. If the Company over-estimates the production units or if a customer reduces its level of anticipated purchases of a particular platform as a result of reduced demand, the Company's actual revenues for that platform may be substantially less than the lifetime revenues the Company had anticipated for that platform.\nTypically, it takes two to three years from the time a manufacturer awards a program until production begins. In many cases, the Company must commit substantial resources in preparation for production under awarded customer business well in advance of the customer\u2019s production start date. The Company's results of operations may be affected due to delay in recovering these types of pre-production costs if the Company's customers cancel awarded business, including cancellation in the event technology supporting the awarded business becomes obsolete.\nThe Company is dependent upon large customers for current and future revenues. The loss of all or a substantial portion of its sales to any of these customers or the loss of market share by these customers could materially harm the Company.\nThe Company depends on major vehicle manufacturers for a substantial portion of its net sales. For example, during 2015, FCA and General Motors accounted for 17.4% and 15.5% of the Company's revenues, respectively. In addition, as a result of the Company's recent acquisitions, the Company expects the portion of its revenues attributable to certain of its larger customers to increase. The loss of all or a substantial portion of the Company's sales to any of its large-volume customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations by reducing cash flows and its ability to spread costs over a larger revenue base. The Company may also make fewer sales to major customers for a variety of reasons other than losses of business relationships, including but not limited to: (1) reduced or delayed customer requirements; (2) strikes or other work stoppages affecting production by the customers; or (3) reduced demand for its customers\u2019 products.\nIn addition, the Company's OEMs customers compete intensively against each other and other OEMs. The loss of market share by any of the Company's significant OEMs could have a material adverse effect on its business unless the Company is able to achieve increased sales to other OEMs.\nThe Company's inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of new program launches could harm the Company's financial performance.\nIn connection with the award of new business, the Company obligates itself to deliver new products and services that are subject to the Company's customers\u2019 timing, performance and quality standards. Additionally, as a Tier 1 supplier, the Company must effectively coordinate the activities of numerous suppliers in order for the program launches of its products to be successful. Given the complexity of new program launches, the Company may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs; however, the Company's sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of its customers\u2019 introduction of new vehicles. For example, the Company experienced a significant delay in revenue in connection with the Ford production delay that resulted from the implementation of the new aluminum-alloy body in the 2015. The Company's inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could harm its financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Finally, even if the Company successfully manages the timing, quality and cost of a new program launch with respect to its operations, its customers\u2019 production delays may be caused by other of its customers\u2019 suppliers, which could harm the Company's financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAutomotive production and sales are highly cyclical, which could harm the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe highly cyclical nature of the automotive industry presents a risk that is outside the Company's control and that often cannot be accurately predicted. The cyclical nature depends on general economic conditions and other factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, consumer preferences, patterns of consumer spending, fuel costs and the automobile replacement cycle. In addition, customer production changeovers or new program launches may result in altered or delayed production cycles, which may reduce or delay purchases of its products by its customers. As a result, automotive production and sales may fluctuate significantly from year-to-year and such fluctuations may give rise to changes in demand for the Company's products. The Company's business is directly related to the volume of automotive production and, because it has significant fixed production costs, declines in the Company's customers\u2019 production levels can have a significant adverse effect on its results of operations. Decreases in demand for automobiles generally, or decreases in demand for the Company's products in particular, could materially and harmfully affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe automotive industry is seasonal, which could harm the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe automotive industry is seasonal. Some of the Company's largest OEM customers typically shut down vehicle production during certain months or weeks of the year. For example, the Company's OEM customers in Europe typically shut down operations during portions of July and August and additional periods during the December and January holiday season,\nwhile its OEM customers in North America typically close assembly plants for periods in June and July for model year changeovers and for an additional periods during the December and January holiday season. During these downturns, the Company's customers will generally reduce the number of production days because of lower demands and reduce excess vehicle inventory. Such seasonality, or unanticipated changes in plant shutdown schedules, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA material disruption at one of the Company's manufacturing facilities could prevent it from meeting customer demand, reduce the Company's revenues or negatively affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nAny of the Company's manufacturing facilities, or any of its machines or equipment within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:\n\u2022\nunscheduled maintenance outages;\n\u2022\nprolonged power failures;\n\u2022\nan equipment failure;\n\u2022\nlabor difficulties;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;\n\u2022\nfires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural catastrophes;\n\u2022\nwar, terrorism or threats of terrorism or political unrest;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations or intervention; and\n\u2022\nother unexpected problems.\nAny such disruption could prevent the Company from meeting customer orders, reduce the Company's revenues or profits and negatively affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe decreasing number of automotive parts suppliers and pricing pressures from the Company's automotive customers could make it more difficult for it to compete in the highly competitive automotive industry.\nThe automotive parts industry is highly competitive. Bankruptcies and consolidation among automotive parts suppliers are reducing the number of competitors, resulting in larger competitors who benefit from purchasing and distribution economies of scale. The Company's inability to compete with these larger suppliers in the future could result in a reduction of, or inability to increase, revenues, which would harm its business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company faces significant competition within each of its major product areas. The principal competitive factors include price, quality, global presence, service, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation, and timely delivery. The Company also faces significant competitive pricing pressures from its automotive customers. Because of their purchasing size, the Company's automotive customers can influence market participants to compete on price terms. If the Company is not able to offset pricing reductions resulting from these pressures by improving operating efficiencies and reducing expenditures, those pricing reductions may have an adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe Company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to continue to compete in the highly competitive automotive industry or that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nFluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harm the Company's financial results.\nThe Company derived 15.9% of its revenue in fiscal year 2015 from its non-U.S. operations. The financial position and results of operations of certain of the Company's international operations are measured using the foreign currency in the jurisdiction of those operations as the functional currency. As a result, the Company is exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from its international operations and in translating its financial results back to U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of the Company's international operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date. The Company's income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during each fiscal quarter. A strengthening U.S. dollar against relevant foreign currency reduces the amount of income the Company recognizes from its international operations. The Company cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on its future operating results. As exchange rates vary, the Company's results of operations and profitability may be harmed. The Company may use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against certain foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from foreign currency variations. The gains or losses associated with hedging activities may harm the Company's results of operations. In addition, the portion of the Company's revenue derived from international operations may increase in the future, due to the impact of its acquisitions and overall growth in foreign\nmarkets, among other reasons. The risks the Company faces in foreign currency transactions and translation may continue to increase as it further develops and expands its international operations.\nThe Company is subject to risks related to its international operations.\nThe Company sells its products worldwide from its manufacturing and distribution facilities in various regions and countries, including the United States, Mexico, Europe and Asia. International operations are subject to various risks which could have a material adverse effect on those operations or its business as a whole, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to local economic conditions and labor issues;\n\u2022\nexposure to local political conditions, including the risk of seizure of assets by a foreign government;\n\u2022\nexposure to local social unrest, including any resultant acts of war, terrorism or similar events;\n\u2022\nexposure to local public health issues and the resultant impact on economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ncontrols on the repatriation of cash, including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nexport and import restrictions; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in penetrating new markets due to established and entrenched competitors.\nThe risks the Company faces in its international operations may intensify if the Company further develops and expands its international operations.\nSignificant increases and fluctuations in raw materials pricing could materially harm the Company without proportionate recovery from its customers.\nSignificant increases in the cost of certain raw materials used in the Company's products, such as aluminum, steel and magnesium ingot, or the cost of utility services required to produce its products, to the extent they are not timely reflected in the price it charges its customers or are otherwise mitigated, could materially and adversely impact the Company's results. Prices for raw material inputs can be impacted by many factors, including developments in global commodities markets, international trade policies and developments in technology. The amount of steel available for processing is a function of the production levels of primary steel producers.\nThe Company obtains steel from a number of primary steel producers and steel service centers. The majority of the steel is purchased through its customers' steel buying programs. Under these programs, the Company purchases steel at the price that its customers negotiated with the steel suppliers. In these cases, the Company takes ownership of the steel; however, its customers are responsible for commodity price fluctuations. If these programs are discontinued by its customers in the future, the Company would have to purchase materials in the open market, which would subject the Company to additional market risk. With respect to the steel it purchases in the open market, the Company uses centralized purchasing to purchase raw materials at the lowest competitive prices for the quantity purchased.\nFor the Company's aluminum and magnesium die casting business, the cost of materials is handled in one of two ways. The primary method is to secure quarterly purchase commitments based on customer releases and then pass the quarterly price changes to those customers utilizing published metal indexes. The second method is to adjust prices monthly or quarterly, based on a referenced metal index plus additional material cost spreads agreed to by the Company and its customers. While the Company has been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of raw material costs, there is no assurance that the Company will continue to do so, or that increases in raw material costs will not adversely impact its business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, significant increases in raw material prices may cause customers to redesign certain components or use alternative materials, which could result in reduced revenues, which could in turn harm the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe volatility of steel prices could materially harm the Company's results of operations.\nA by-product of the Company's production process is the generation of offal. The Company typically sells offal in secondary markets, which are similar to the steel markets. The Company generally shares recoveries from sales of offal with its customers either through scrap sharing agreements, in cases in which the Company is participating in resale programs, or through product pricing, in cases in which it purchases steel directly from steel suppliers. In either situation, the Company may be affected by the fluctuation in scrap steel prices, either positively or negatively, in relation to its various customer agreements. As offal prices generally increase and decrease as steel prices increase and decrease, sales of offal may mitigate the impact of the volatility\nof steel price increases, as well as limit the benefits reaped from steel price declines. Any volatility in offal and steel prices could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDisruptions in the automotive supply chain could materially harm the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe automotive supply chain is subject to disruptions because the Company, along with its customers and suppliers, attempts to maintain low inventory levels. Disruptions could result from a variety of situations, such as the closure of one of its or the Company's suppliers\u2019 plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions or political upheaval. Disruptions could also result from logistical complications due to weather, earthquakes, or other natural or nuclear disasters, mechanical failures, technology disruptions or delayed customs processing.\nIf the Company is the cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from the Company. Any disruptions affecting the Company or caused by the Company could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLonger product lives of automotive parts may harm demand for some of the Company's products.\nThe average useful life of automotive parts may increase due to innovations in products and technologies. As automotive product life cycles lengthen, opportunities to supply components for new programs may occur less frequently, which may reduce demand for some of the Company's products.\nDiscontinuation of the vehicle models, engines or transmissions for which the Company manufactures products may harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's typical sales contract provides for supplying a customer with its product requirements for particular programs, rather than manufacturing a specific quantity of components and systems. The initial terms of the Company's sales contracts typically range from one to six years, with automatic renewal provisions that generally result in its contracts running for the life of the program. The Company's contracts do not require its customers to purchase a minimum number of components or systems. The loss of awarded business or significant reduction in demand for vehicles for which it produces components and systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe hourly workforce in the Company's industry is highly unionized and the Company's business could be harmed by labor disruptions.\nAs of October 31, 2015, approximately 21% of the Company's U.S. hourly employees and 91% of the Company's non-U.S. employees were unionized. Although the Company considers its current relations with its employees to be satisfactory, if major work disruptions were to occur, the Company's business could be harmed by, for instance, a loss of revenues, increased costs or reduced profitability. The Company has not experienced a material labor disruption in its recent history, but there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience a material labor disruption at one of its facilities in the future in the course of renegotiation of its labor arrangements or otherwise.\nIn addition, many of the hourly employees of Fiat Chrysler Automotive and General Motors in North America and many of their other suppliers are unionized. Vehicle manufacturers, their suppliers and their respective employees in other countries are also subject to labor agreements. A work stoppage or strike at one of the Company's production facilities, at those of a customer, or impacting a supplier of the Company's or any of its customers, such as the 2008 strike at a Tier 1 supplier that resulted in 30 General Motors facilities in North America being idled for several months, could have a material adverse impact on the Company by disrupting demand for the Company's products and/or its ability to manufacture its products.\nThe Company may incur costs related to product warranties, environmental and regulatory matters, legal proceedings and other claims, which could materially harm its financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Company receives product warranty claims from its customers, pursuant to which the Company may be required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of the Company's products. Vehicle manufacturers require their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and to be responsible for the operation of these component products in new vehicles sold to consumers. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field.\nThe Company also from time to time is involved in a variety of legal proceedings, claims or investigations. These matters typically are incidental to the conduct of its business. Some of these matters involve allegations of damages against the Company relating to environmental liabilities, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, taxes, employment matters or commercial or contractual disputes or allegations relating to legal compliance by the Company or its employees.\nThe Company vigorously defends itself in connection with all of the matters described above. The Company cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in the Company's consolidated financial statements. In future periods, the Company could be subject to cash costs or charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved unfavorably to the Company in amounts exceeding any reserves for such matters.\nProduct recalls by vehicle manufacturers could negatively impact the Company's production levels, which could materially harm the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, there have been significant product recalls by some of the world's largest vehicle manufacturers. Recalls may result in decreased vehicle production as a result of a manufacturer focusing its efforts on the problems underlying the recall rather than generating new sales volume. In addition, consumers may elect not to purchase vehicles manufactured by the vehicle manufacturer initiating the recall, or by vehicle manufacturers in general, while the recalls persist. The Company does not maintain insurance in North America for product recall matters, as such insurance is not generally available on acceptable terms. Any reduction in vehicle production volumes, especially by its OEM customers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on information technology and a failure of its information technology infrastructure could adversely impact its business and operations.\nThe Company's operations rely on a number of information technologies to manage, store and support business activities. The Company has a number of systems, processes and practices in place that are designed to protect against the failure of its systems. The Company recognizes the increasing volume of cyber-attacks and employs commercially practical efforts to provide reasonable assurance such attacks are appropriately mitigated. The Company's systems and those of its service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond its reasonable control including acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest and denial of service attacks which may lead to the theft of the Company's intellectual property, trade secrets, or business disruption. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to its data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to its reputation, affect its relationships with the Company's customers, suppliers and employees, lead to claims against it and ultimately harm the Company's business. Additionally, the Company may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nIf the Company is unable to protect its intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against the Company or its customers relating to intellectual property rights, the Company's business could be harmed.\nThe Company owns important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and could be involved in licensing arrangements. The Company's intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining the Company's competitive position. Notwithstanding its intellectual property portfolio, the Company's competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to the Company's proprietary technologies or design around the patents the Company owns or licenses. Various patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws provide limited protection and may not prevent the Company's competitors from duplicating its products or gaining access to its proprietary information. Further, as the Company expands its operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating its proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts the Company undertakes to protect them.\nOn occasion, the Company may assert claims against third parties who are taking actions that it believes is infringing on the Company's intellectual property rights. Similarly, third parties may assert claims against the Company and its customers and distributors alleging its products infringe upon third party intellectual property rights. These claims, regardless of their merit or resolution, are frequently costly to prosecute, defend or settle and divert the efforts and attention of the Company's management and employees. Claims of this sort also could harm the Company's relationships with its customers and might deter future customers from doing business with the Company. If any such claim were to result in an adverse outcome, the Company could be required to take actions which may include: expending significant resources to develop or license non-infringing products; paying substantial damages to third parties, including to customers to compensate them for their discontinued use or replacing infringing technology with non-infringing technology; or cessation of the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products. Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, or its competitive position.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with changing manufacturing technologies, which could place it at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe successful implementation of the Company's business strategy requires it to continuously evolve its existing products and introduce new products to meet customers\u2019 needs. The Company's products are characterized by stringent performance and specification requirements that mandate a high degree of manufacturing and engineering expertise. If the Company fails to meet these requirements, the Company's business could be at risk.\nThe Company believes that its customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nproduct quality;\n\u2022\ntechnical expertise and development capability;\n\u2022\nnew product innovation;\n\u2022\nreliability and timeliness of delivery;\n\u2022\nprice competitiveness;\n\u2022\nproduct design capability;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing expertise;\n\u2022\noperational flexibility;\n\u2022\nglobal production capabilities;\n\u2022\ncustomer service; and\n\u2022\noverall management.\nThe Company's success will depend on its ability to continue to meet its customers\u2019 changing specifications with respect to these criteria. The Company cannot assure you that it will be able to address technological advances or introduce new products that may be necessary to remain competitive within its businesses. Furthermore, the Company cannot assure you that it can adequately protect any of the Company's own technological developments to produce a sustainable competitive advantage.\nThe loss of executive officers or key employees of the Company may materially harm operations and the ability to manage the day-to-day aspects of the Company's business.\nThe Company's future performance substantially depends on its ability to retain and motivate executive officers and key employees. The Company's ability to manage the day-to-day aspects of its business may be materially harmed with the loss of any of its executive officers or key employees, which have many years of experience with the Company and within the automotive industry and other manufacturing industries, or if the Company is unable to recruit qualified personnel. The loss of the services of one or more executive officers or key employees, who also have strong personal ties with customers and suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is involved from time to time in legal proceedings, claims or investigations, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company is involved from time to time in legal proceedings, claims or investigations that could be significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of its business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with suppliers, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, environmental issues, tax matters and employment matters. No assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and the cost of complying, or its failure to comply with such requirements may materially harm the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment, the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport or disposal of hazardous waste materials, or otherwise relating to the protection of public and employee health, safety and the environment. These laws and regulations expose the Company to liability for the environmental condition of its current facilities, and also may expose the Company to liability for the conduct of others or for its actions that were not in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken. These laws and regulations also may expose the Company to liability for claims of personal injury or property damage related to alleged exposure to hazardous or toxic materials. Despite the Company's intentions to be in compliance with all such laws and regulations, the Company cannot guarantee that it will at all times be in compliance with all such requirements. The cost of complying with these requirements may also increase substantially in future years. If the Company\nviolates or fails to comply with these requirements, it could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. These requirements are complex, change frequently and may become more stringent over time, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe Company's failure to maintain and comply with environmental permits that it is required to maintain could result in fines or penalties or other sanctions and have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations or results. Future events, such as new environmental regulations or changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, newly discovered information or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company cannot assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with its use of highly specialized machinery that cannot be easily replaced.\nThe Company's machinery and tooling are complex, cannot be easily replicated and have a long lead-time to manufacture. If there is a breakdown in such machinery and tooling, and the Company or its service providers are unable to repair in a timely fashion, obtaining replacement machinery or rebuilding tooling could involve significant delays and costs, and may not be available to the Company on reasonable terms. Any disruption to the Company's machinery could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company has goodwill, which, if it becomes impaired, would result in a reduction in the Company's net income and equity.\nGoodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles require that goodwill be periodically evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value. As of October 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $28,843 of goodwill, or 4.3% of its total assets, that could be subject to impairment. Declines in the Company's profitability or the value of comparable companies may impact the fair value which could result in a write-down of goodwill and a reduction of net income.\nMTD Holdings Inc. may exercise significant influence over the Company.\nMTD Holdings Inc. and its affiliates owned approximately 48.5% of the Company's common stock as of October 31, 2015. As a result, MTD Holdings Inc. and its affiliates have significant influence over the vote in any election of directors and thereby its policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of the Company's common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on the Company's common stock, the incurrence of debt by the Company, amendments to the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions, and its interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests. In addition, MTD Holdings Inc. may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to the Company or conflict with the interests of other stockholders.\nThe Company may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nThe Company's provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy its income tax obligations in the future could be harmed by changes in the level of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, changes in its plans to reinvest the earnings of the Company's non-U.S. operations outside the United States and changes in tax laws and regulations. The Company's income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and tax authorities outside the United States. The results of these examinations and the ongoing assessments of the Company's tax exposures could also have an adverse effect on its provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy the Company's income tax obligations.\nCertain of the Company's pension plans are underfunded and the Company has unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations. Additional cash contributions the Company may be required to make to its pension plans or amounts the Company may be required to pay in respect of post-retirement benefit obligations will reduce the cash available for its business.\nCertain of the Company's employees in the United States are participants in defined benefit pension plans which it sponsors. As of October 31, 2015, the unfunded amount of the Company's U.S. pension plans was approximately $20,172. While future benefit accruals under its U.S. defined benefit plans were frozen, the Company may have ongoing obligations to make\ncontributions to its U.S. pension plans as required in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\"ERISA\"), and the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, the Company sponsors unfunded post-retirement benefits for a limited number of employees. As of October 31, 2015, the unfunded amount for these post-retirement benefits was approximately $423. Cash contributions to these plans and payment of these post-retirement benefit obligations will reduce the cash available for the Company's business. Under ERISA, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\"PBGC\") has the authority to petition a court to terminate an underfunded defined benefit pension plan under limited circumstances. In the event the Company's pension plans are terminated by the PBGC, the Company could be liable to the PBGC for the entire amount of the underfunding, as calculated by the PBGC based on its own assumptions (which likely would result in a larger obligation than that based on the assumptions it has used to fund such plans).\nThe Company may incur material costs related to plant closings, which could materially harm the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf the Company must close manufacturing facilities because of lost business or consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the employee termination costs, asset retirements, and other exit costs associated with the closure of these facilities may be significant. In certain circumstances, the Company may close a manufacturing facility that is operated under a lease agreement and it may continue to incur material costs in accordance with the lease agreement. The Company attempts to align production capacity with demand; however, the Company cannot provide assurance that plants will not have to be closed.\nRegulations related to \"conflict minerals\" may cause the Company to incur substantial expenses and otherwise adversely impact the Company's business.\nNew regulations related to \"conflict minerals\" may cause the Company to incur additional expenses and may make its supply chain more complex. In August 2012, the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use certain minerals known as \"conflict minerals\", which may or may not be mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, in their products. These requirements required due diligence efforts beginning in 2013, with initial disclosure requirements which began in 2014. There are significant costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in the Company's products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or remediate weaknesses could materially harm the Company\u2019s revenues and trading price of the common stock. If the Company cannot accurately report financial results, shareholder confidence is eroded in the Company's ability to pursue business and maintain the trading price of its common stock.\nInternal control systems are intended to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Beginning in the third quarter of the Company\u2019s 2015 fiscal year, management implemented certain new internal control testing procedures, which identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting at the Wellington facility. Based on results of testing during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, management identified control deficiencies over its Wellington manufacturing plant and certain other facilities utilizing the same reporting system, and concluded its internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective as of October 31, 2015. As described in Item 9A of this Form 10-K, during 2015 the Company identified control deficiencies with respect to the design and operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, which when aggregated, represented material weaknesses in certain monitoring controls relating to journal entries and account reconciliations. The Company has taken immediate measures to remediate the deficiencies, and plans to complete remediation as quickly as possible in 2016. Matters impacting the Company's internal controls may cause it to be unable to report its financial data on a timely basis, or may cause it to restate previously issued financial data, and thereby subject the Company to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in the Company and the reliability of its financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of the Company's financial statements is also likely to suffer if the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm report a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. As with any material weakness, if remedial measures are insufficient to address these material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the Company's consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements.", "PERMNO": 79307, "SIC": 3460, "TIC": "SHLOQ"}
