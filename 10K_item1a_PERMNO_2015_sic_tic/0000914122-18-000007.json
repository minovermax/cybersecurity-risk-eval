{"cik": "914122", "company": "Perma-Pipe International Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. These risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company has incurred net losses for its past two fiscal years and it may be unable to achieve profitability or positive cash flows in the future. The Company has experienced net losses for the past two fiscal years. Generating net income and positive cash flows in the future will depend on its ability to successfully complete and execute its strategic plan. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to achieve profitability or positive cash flows in the future.The Company\u2019s inability to successfully achieve profitability and positive cash flows may result in it experiencing a serious liquidity deficiency resulting in material adverse consequences that could threaten its viability.\nGlobal economic weakness and volatility may adversely affect operating margins for the Company\u2019s services and products. If the global economy experiences a severe and prolonged downturn, it could adversely impact the Company's business, directly or indirectly. Downturns in such general economic conditions can significantly affect the business of the Company's customers, which in turn affects demand, volume, pricing, and operating margins for the Company's services and products. A downturn in one or more of the Company's significant markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition. Because economic and market conditions vary within the Company's geographic regions, the Company's performance will also vary. In addition, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodity prices, including rising steel prices and surcharges.\nFluctuations in the availability of, and price of steel, may affect the Company's results of operations. The steel industry is highly cyclical in nature, and at times, pricing can be highly volatile due to a number of factors beyond the Company's control, including general economic conditions, import duties, other trade restrictions and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the Company's gross profit.\nIn March, 2018, President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a 25% tariff on all imported steel products for an indefinite period of time under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The tariff will be imposed on all steel imports with the exception of steel imported from Canada, Mexico and Australia, and the administration is considering exemption requests from other countries. The Company expects these actions to increase steel costs and decrease supply availability.\nThe Company has been updating its quoting system for the movements in steel prices, and intends to recover these price differentials through price increases in the Company's products, however, the Company may not always be successful. Any increase in steel prices that is not offset by an increase in the Company's prices could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if the Company is unable to acquire timely steel supplies, it may need to decline bid and order opportunities, which could also have an adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nDelays in the timing of orders for the Company\u2019s products may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results. Since the Company's revenues are based on large discrete projects, the Company's operating results in any reporting period could be negatively impacted as a result of large variations in the level of overall market demand or delays in the timing of project execution phases.\nDecreases in United States government spending on projects using the Company\u2019s products, and challenges to the Company\u2019s non-government customers\u2019 liquidity and availability of capital funds may adversely impact demand for the Company\u2019s products. Uncertainty about economic market conditions poses risks that the Company's customers may postpone spending for capital improvement and maintenance projects in response to tighter credit markets or negative financial news, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for the Company's products. Decreases in U.S. federal and state spending on projects using the Company's products can have negative impact on sales volume from the Company's domestic facilities. Governmental spending on large infrastructure projects in the Gulf Cooperation Council (\"GCC\") countries vary and spending has in the past been curtailed or delayed as a result of reduced public spending budgets in countries which are dependent on oil and gas revenues and their respective price levels.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully negotiate progress-billing arrangements for its large contracts, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s working capital needs and credit risk. The Company sells systems and products under contracts that allow the Company to either bill upon the completion of certain agreed upon milestones, or upon actual shipment of the system or product. The Company attempts to negotiate progress-billing milestones on large contracts to help manage its working capital and to reduce the credit risk associated with these large contracts. Consequently, shifts in the billing terms of the contracts in the backlog from period to period can increase the Company's requirements for working capital and can increase its exposure to credit risk.\nCrude oil and natural gas prices are volatile, and the substantial and extended decline in commodity prices has had, and may continue to have, a material and adverse effect on demand and pricing in the Company's business. Prices for crude oil and natural gas fluctuate widely. Among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are:\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer demand;\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide supplies of crude oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international drilling activity;\n\u2022\nthe actions of other crude oil exporting nations and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u2022\nworldwide economic and political conditions, including political instability or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources, including alternative energy sources.\nGenerally, when the prices for crude oil and natural gas are higher, demand for the Company\u2019s products increases and the Company is able to negotiate higher prices. On the other hand, when the prices of crude oil and natural gas are lower, demand for the Company\u2019s products decreases and the Company is forced to compete with lower prices and other concessions. Volatility in these commodity prices can also result in circumstances where demand for the Company\u2019s products is suddenly high, but the Company is unable to negotiate higher prices, thereby adversely impacting the Company\u2019s margins and capacity to accept new projects at higher margins.\nThe Company may be unable to repay its debt, refinance its current expiring lending agreement, or renew its expiring credit facilities. If there were an event of default under the Company's current revolving credit facilities, the lenders\ncould cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. The Company cannot assure that its cash flow will be sufficient to fully repay amounts due under any of the financing arrangements, if accelerated upon an event of default, or, that the Company would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments under any such arrangements. Complying with the covenants under the Company's domestic and/or foreign revolving credit facilities may limit management's discretion by restricting options such as:\n\u2022\nincurring additional debt;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmaking investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nrepurchase of Company's shares;\n\u2022\npayment of dividends, capital returns, repayment of intercompany obligations and other forms of repatriation; and\n\u2022\ncreating liens.\nThe Company\u2019s United States credit agreement will expire in September 2018. While the Company is actively pursuing refinancing its credit agreement and replacement financing sources, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in refinancing its credit agreement or obtaining such replacement financing, or if obtained, that such financing will be in a similar amount or be on similar terms and conditions as the Company's current credit agreement.\nThe Company\u2019 credit arrangements used by its Middle Eastern subsidiaries is renewed on an annual basis. In addition to these credit arrangements, the Company also obtains project financing in the Middle East on a project-by-project basis. While the Company believes that it will be able to renew its Middle East credit arrangements and will have continued access to individual project financing, there is no assurance that such arrangements will be renewed or made available in similar amounts or be on similar terms and conditions as the current arrangements, or that such individual project financing will be available for projects that the Company is interested in pursuing.\nAny replacement credit arrangements outside of the United States may further limit the Company\u2019s ability to repatriate funds from abroad. Repatriation of funds from certain countries may become limited based upon regulatory restrictions or economically unfeasible because of the taxation of funds when moved to another subsidiary or to the parent company. In addition, any refinancing, replacement or additional financing the Company may obtain could contain similar or more restrictive covenants than the Company is currently subject to. The Company\u2019s ability to comply with any covenants may be adversely affected by general economic conditions, political decisions, industry conditions and other events beyond management\u2019s control.\nAggressive pricing by existing competitors and the entrance of new competitors in the markets in which the Company operates could drive down the Company's profits and prohibit or slow the Company's growth. The Company's business is highly competitive. Some of the Company's competitors are larger and have more resources than the Company. Additionally, many of the Company's products are also subject to competition from alternative technologies and alternative products. In periods of declining demand, the Company's fixed cost structure may limit its ability to cut costs, which may be a competitive disadvantage compared to firms with more flexible cost structures, or may result in reduced operating margins and operating losses.\nThe Company may be unable to purchase raw materials at favorable prices, or maintain beneficial relationships with its suppliers, which could result in a shortage of supply, or increased pricing. To the extent the Company relies upon a single source for key components of several of its products, the Company believes there are alternate sources available for such components. However, there can be no assurance that the interruption of supplies of such components would not have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company and that the Company, if required to do so, would be able to negotiate agreements with alternative sources on acceptable terms.\nThe Company may be subject to claims for damages for defective products. The Company warrants its products to be free of certain defects. The Company has, from time to time, had claims alleging defects in its products. The Company cannot be certain it will not experience material product liability losses in the future or that it will not incur significant costs to defend such claims. While the Company currently has product liability insurance, the Company cannot be\ncertain that its product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities that may be incurred in the future or that such coverage will continue to be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms. Any claims relating to defective products that result in liabilities exceeding the Company's insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nProduct and service orders included in the Company\u2019s backlog may be reduced or cancelled. The Company defines backlog as the revenue value resulting from confirmed customer purchase orders that have not yet been recognized as revenue. However, by industry practice, orders may be canceled or modified at any time. If a customer cancels an order, the customer is normally responsible for all finished goods produced or shipped, all direct and indirect costs incurred and also for a reasonable allowance for anticipated profits. No assurance can be given that these amounts will be recovered after cancellation. Any cancellation or delay in orders may result in lower than expected revenue.\nThe Company may be unable to attract and retain its senior management and key personnel. The Company's ability to meet its strategic and financial goals will depend to a significant extent on the continued contributions of its senior management and key personnel. Future success will also depend in large part on the Company's ability to identify, attract, motivate, effectively utilize and retain highly qualified managerial, sales, marketing and technical personnel. The loss of senior management or other key personnel or the inability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could make it more difficult to manage the Company's business and could adversely affect operations and financial results.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve the expected benefits from its growth initiatives. The Company's cyclical or general expansion may result in unanticipated adverse consequences, including significant strain on management, operations and financial systems as well as on the Company's ability to attract and retain competent employees. In the future, the Company may seek to grow its business by investing in new or existing facilities, making acquisitions, entering into partnerships and joint ventures, or constructing new facilities, which could entail a number of additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nstrain on working capital;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention away from other activities, which could impair the operation of existing businesses;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or facilities into existing operations;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;\n\u2022\nloss of key personnel of the acquired business or facility;\n\u2022\nexposure to unanticipated liabilities; and\n\u2022\nfailure to realize efficiencies, synergies and cost savings.\nAs a result of these and other factors, including general economic risks, the Company may not be able to realize the expected benefits from future acquisitions, new facility developments, partnerships, joint ventures or other investments.\nThe Company's financial results could be adversely affected by changes in international regulations and other activities of U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies related to the Company\u2019s international operations. International sales represent a significant portion of the Company's total sales. The Company's sales to international customers increased from 57.0% in 2016 to 59.5% in 2017. The Company's anticipated growth and profitability may require increasing current international sales volume and may necessitate further international expansion. The Company's financial results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, other activities of U.S. and non-U.S. governments, agencies and similar organizations, and other factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products, local labor conditions and regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, restrictions on currency exchange activities, burdensome taxes and tariffs and other trade barriers. International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities and war, could lead to reduced international sales and reduced profitability associated with such sales. In addition, these risks can include extraordinarily delayed collections of accounts receivable. Because the Company conducts a significant portion of its\nbusiness activities in the Middle East, the political and economic events of the countries that comprise the GCC can have a material effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nDue to the international scope of the Company\u2019s operations, it is subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy. The Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. If the activities of these entities do not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or the Company\u2019s Code of Business Conduct, then violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt the Company\u2019s business, and result in an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. The Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which its operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nFollowing the departures of the Company\u2019s Middle East region President and Vice President in June 2017 and the related regional management transition, the Company\u2019s management became concerned that its corporate policies, procedures and internal controls within the region may not have been adhered to fully by the prior management team. As a result of these concerns, the Company engaged outside third-party firms to complete an extensive review of regional management activities from early 2014. The total non-recurring cost for this review and the resulting policy improvement implementations for 2017 was approximately $1.2 million. While the Company believes the majority of the costs associated with this review and policy improvements has already been incurred, there can be no assurance the Company will not be subject to further material expenses related to this matter.\nThe Company may not be able to recover costs and damages from vendors that supply defective materials. The Company may receive defective materials from its vendors that are incorporated into the Company's products during the manufacturing process. The cost to repair, remake or replace defective products could be greater than the amount that can be recovered from the vendor. Such excess costs could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company may be required to reverse previously recorded revenue and profits as a result of inaccurate estimates made in connection with the Company\u2019s percentage-of-completion revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenues under its stated revenue recognition policy except for sizable domestic complex contracts that require periodic recognition of income. For these contracts, the Company uses the \"percentage of completion\" accounting method. This methodology allows revenue and profits to be recognized proportionally over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the cost incurred to date against the total amount of cost expected to be incurred. The effect of revisions to revenue and total estimated cost is recorded when the amounts are known or can be reasonably estimated. These revisions can occur at any time and could be material. On a historical basis, management believes that reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion on long-term contracts have been made. However, given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts, it is possible for actual cost to vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenue and profits.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results. The Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that the Company would prevent or detect a misstatement of its financial statements or fraud.\nAs of January 31, 2018, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to an identified material weakness. The material weakness resulted from an accounting error identified by the Company during its preparation and review of the Company\u2019s financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2017 related to the Company's stock-based\ncompensation cost. Specifically, the Company had improperly reversed stock-based compensation costs for vested equity awards that expired, terminated or were cancelled unexercised. This accounting error was attributable to the Company\u2019s lack of technical accounting knowledge. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. While the Company believes that it has implemented proper controls to address the material weakness described above, the material weakness cannot be considered fully remediated until the remediation processes have been in operation for a period of time and successfully tested. If the current material weakness is not remediated, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and the Company could be required to restate its financial results. The failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the Company\u2019s ability to report its financial results accurately and in a timely manner or to detect and prevent fraud and could also cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company's information technology systems may be negatively affected by cybersecurity threats. The Company faces risks relating to cybersecurity attacks that could cause the loss of confidential information and other business disruptions. The Company relies extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage its business, and its business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks. These could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and computer systems. Attacks can be both individual and/ or highly organized attempts organized by very sophisticated hacking organizations. The Company employs a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, which include password encryption, frequent password change events, firewall detection systems, anti-virus software in-place and frequent backups; however, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber-attack. A successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect the Company's reputation and results of operations, including through lawsuits by third-parties.", "PERMNO": 76052, "SIC": 3490, "TIC": "PPIH"}
