RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion identifies the most significant risks or uncertainties that could (i) materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects or (ii) cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations. The following information should be read in conjunction with the other portions of this report, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8. Please note that the following discussion is not intended to comprehensively list all risks or uncertainties faced by us. Our operations or actual results could also be similarly impacted by additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, that we currently deem to be immaterial, that arise in the future or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions. In addition, certain of the risks described below apply only to a part of our business.\nRisks Affecting Our Business\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors.\nEach of our offerings to our customers face increasingly intense competition from a wide variety of sources under evolving market conditions. In particular, aggressive competition from a wide range of communications and technology companies has limited the prospects for several of our offerings to our customers. We expect these trends will continue. For more detailed information, see \"Business-Competition\" in Item 1 of this report.\nWe are facing increasing competition from various sources, including long distance carriers, other ILECs, CLECs, cable companies, cloud companies, technology companies, device providers, resellers, and sales agents. Further competition could arise through industry consolidation, technological innovation, or changes in regulation, including changes allowing foreign carriers to more extensively compete in the U.S. market.\nSome of our current and potential competitors (i) offer a more comprehensive range of communications products and services, (ii) offer products or services with features that we cannot readily match in some or all of our\nmarkets, (iii) install their services quicker than us, (iv) have greater marketing, engineering, research, development, technical, provisioning, customer relations, financial and other resources, (v) have larger or more diverse networks with greater transmission capacity, (vi) conduct operations or raise capital at a lower cost than us, (vii) offer services to a larger geographic area or larger base of customers, (viii) have substantially stronger brand names, which may provide them with greater pricing power than ours, or (ix) have larger operations than ours, which may enable them to compete more successfully in recruiting top talent, entering into operational or strategic partnerships or acquiring companies. Consequently, these competitors may be better equipped to provide more attractive offerings, to charge lower prices for their products and services, to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructure more quickly, to adapt more swiftly to changes in technologies or customer requirements, to devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services, to provide more comprehensive customer service, to provide greater resources to research and development initiatives and to take advantage of business or other opportunities more readily.\nCompetition could adversely impact us in several ways, including (i) the loss of customers and market share, (ii) the possibility of customers terminating or reducing their usage of our services or shifting to less profitable services, (iii) reduced traffic on our networks, (iv) our need to expend substantial time or money on new capital improvement projects, (v) our need to lower prices or increase marketing expenses to remain competitive and (vi) our inability to diversify by successfully offering new products or services.\nWe are continually taking steps to respond to these competitive pressures, but these efforts may not be successful. Our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected if these initiatives are unsuccessful or insufficient.\nRapid technological changes could significantly impact our competitive and financial position.\nThe communications industry has been and continues to be impacted by significant technological changes, enabling a broader array of companies to compete with us. Many of these technological changes are (i) enabling customers to reduce or bypass use of our networks, (ii) displacing or reducing demand for our services, or (iii) enabling the development of competitive products or services. Technological advancements have also permitted cable companies to provide competing data transmission services. Development in software have permitted new competitors to offer affordable products that historically required more expensive hardware investments. To enhance the competitiveness of certain of our services, we will likely be required to spend additional capital to install more fiber optic cable or otherwise improve our networks.\nWe may not be able to accurately predict or respond to changes in technology or industry standards, or to the introduction of newly-offered services. Any of these developments could make some or all of our offerings less desirable or even obsolete, which would place downward pressure on our market share and revenues. These developments could also require us to (i) expend capital or other resources in excess of currently contemplated levels, (ii) forego the development or provision of products or services that others can provide more efficiently, or (iii) make other changes to our operating plans, corporate strategies or capital allocation plans, any of which could be contrary to the expectations of our security holders or could adversely impact our business operating results.\nEven if we succeed in adapting to changes in technology or industry standards by developing new products or services, there is no assurance that the new products or services would have a positive impact on our profit margins or financial performance.\nIn addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we may need, from time to time, to phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. Similarly, if new market entrants are not burdened by an installed base of outdated equipment or obsolete technology, they may have a competitive advantage over us.\nFor additional information on the risks of increased expenditures, see \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Affecting our Liquidity and Capital Resources-Our business requires us to incur substantial capital and operating expenses, which reduces our available free cash flow.\u201d\nOur failure to meet the evolving needs of our customers could adversely impact our competitive position.\nIn order to compete effectively and respond to changing market conditions, we must continuously offer products and services on terms and conditions that allow us to retain and attract customers and to meet their evolving needs. To do so, we continuously invest in our network and develop, test and introduce new products and services. Our ability to maintain attractive products and services and to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost-effective basis could be constrained by a range of factors, including network limitations, support system limitations, limited capital, an inability to attract key personnel with the necessary skills, intellectual property constraints, inadequate digitization or automation testing delays, technological limits or an inability to act as quickly or efficiently as other competitors. In addition, new product or service offerings may not be widely accepted by our customers. Our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to maintain competitive products and services and to timely and successfully develop and introduce new products or services.\nOur failure to continuously develop effective service support systems could adversely impact our competitive position.\nFor many of our services, we can effectively compete only if we can quickly and efficiently (i) quote and accept customer orders, (ii) provision and initiate ordered services, (iii) provide customers with adequate means to manage their services and (iv) accurately bill for our services. Development of systems designed to support these tasks is a significant undertaking that continuously requires our personnel and third-party vendors to adjust to changes in our offerings and customers' preferences, to eliminate inconsistencies between the practices of our legacy operations and acquired operations, to eliminate older support systems that are costly or obsolete, to develop uniform practices and procedures, and to automate them as much as possible. Our failure to continuously develop service support systems that are satisfactory to our current and potential customers and capable of being utilized by our workforce could adversely impact our competitive position.\nWe could be harmed by security breaches, damages or other significant disruptions or failures of our networks, information technology infrastructure or related systems, or of those we operate for certain of our customers.\nWe are materially reliant upon our networks, information technology infrastructure and related technology systems (including our billing and provisioning systems) to provide products and services to our customers and to manage our operations and affairs. We face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach or significant disruption of our information technology infrastructure and related systems. As a communications company that transmits large amounts of information over communications networks, we face an added risk that a security breach or other significant disruption of our networks, infrastructure or systems could lead to material interruptions or curtailments of service. Moreover, in connection with processing and storing sensitive and confidential customer data, we face a heightened risk that a security breach or disruption could result in unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 proprietary information.\nWe strive to maintain the security and integrity of information and systems under our control, and maintain contingency plans in the event of security breaches or other system disruptions. Nonetheless, we cannot assure you that our security efforts and measures will prevent unauthorized access to our systems, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses, malware, ransomware, distributed denial-of-service attacks, or other forms of cyber-attacks or similar events. These threats may derive from human error, hardware or software vulnerabilities, aging equipment or accidental technological failure. These threats may also stem from fraud, malice or sabotage on the part of employees, third parties or foreign nations, including attempts by outside parties to fraudulently induce our employees or customers to disclose or grant access to our data or our customers\u2019 data, potentially including information subject to stringent domestic and foreign data protection laws governing personally identifiable information, protected health information or other similar types of sensitive data. These threats may also arise from failure or breaches of systems owned, operated or controlled by other unaffiliated operators to the extent we rely on such other systems to deliver\nservices to our customers. Each of these risks could further intensify to the extent we maintain information in digital form stored on servers connected to the Internet.\nSimilar to other large communications companies, we are a constant target of cyber-attacks of varying degrees. Although some of these attacks have resulted in security breaches, to date, none of these breaches have resulted in a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. You should be aware, however, that the risk of breaches is likely to increase due to the greater use of open and software-defined networks, our increased operation of offshore systems, and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks. You should be further aware that defenses against cyber-attacks currently available to U.S. companies are unlikely to prevent intrusions by a highly-determined, highly-sophisticated hacker. Consequently, you should assume that we will be unable to implement security barriers or other preventative measures that repel all future cyber-attacks. Any such future security breaches or disruptions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, especially in light of the growing frequency, scope and well-documented sophistication of cyber-attacks and intrusions.\nAlthough CenturyLink maintains cyber liability insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions (including self-insured deductibles, coverage restrictions and monetary coverage caps), cover certain aspects of our cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our losses.\nAdditional risks to our network, infrastructure and related systems include:\n\u2022\npower losses or physical damage, whether caused by fire, flood, adverse weather conditions, terrorism, sabotage, vandalism or otherwise;\n\u2022\ncapacity or system configuration limitations, including those resulting from changes in our customer's usage patterns, the introduction of new technologies or products, or incompatibilities between our newer and older systems;\n\u2022\ntheft or failure of our equipment;\n\u2022\nsoftware or hardware obsolescence, defects or malfunctions;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in our processes or controls;\n\u2022\nour inability to hire and retain personnel with the requisite skills to adequately maintain or improve our systems;\n\u2022\nprogramming, processing and other human error; and\n\u2022\nservice failures of our third-party vendors and other disruptions that are beyond our control.\nDue to these factors, from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we experience disruptions in our service, and could experience more significant disruptions in the future.\nDisruptions, security breaches and other significant failures of the above-described networks and systems could:\n\u2022\ndisrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems, which could in turn disrupt (i) our operational, billing or other administrative functions or (ii) the operations of certain of our customers who rely upon us to provide services critical to their operations;\n\u2022\nresult in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive, classified or otherwise valuable information of ours, our\ncustomers or our customers\u2019 end users, including trade secrets, which others could use for competitive, disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to notify customers, regulatory agencies or the public of data breaches;\n\u2022\nrequire us to provide credits for future service under certain service level commitments we have provided contractually to our customers or to offer expensive incentives to retain customers;\n\u2022\nsubject us to claims for damages, fines, penalties or terminations, which could in certain cases exceed our insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nresult in a loss of business, damage our reputation among our customers and the public generally, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to prolonged litigation; or\n\u2022\nrequire significant management attention or financial resources to remedy the resulting damages or to change our systems, including expenses to repair systems, add new personnel or develop additional protective systems.\nAny or all of the foregoing developments could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe could experience difficulties in expanding and updating our technical infrastructure.\nOur ability to expand and update our systems and information technology infrastructure in response to our growth and changing business needs is important to our ability to maintain and develop attractive product and service offerings. Unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects may lead to increased project costs or operational inefficiencies. In addition, there may be issues related to our expanded or updated infrastructure that are not identified by our testing processes, and which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the redesigned systems. Our failure to modernize and upgrade our technology infrastructure could have adverse consequences, including the delayed implementation of new service offerings, decreased competitiveness of existing service offerings, network instabilities, increased operating or acquisition integration costs, service or billing interruptions or delays, service offering inconsistencies and the diversion of development resources. Any or all of the foregoing developments could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact us.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers depends in part upon external perceptions of our products, services and management integrity. Customer complaints, governmental investigations, outages, or other service failures of networks operated by us could cause substantial adverse publicity affecting us. Similar events impacting other operators could indirectly harm us by causing substantial adverse publicity affecting our industry in general. In either case, press coverage, social media messaging or other public statements that insinuate improper actions by us or other operators, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation, governmental investigations or additional regulations. Addressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation or investigations may distract management, increase costs and divert resources. Negative publicity may have an adverse impact on our reputation and the morale of our employees, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nMarket prices for many of our services have decreased in the past, and any similar price decreases in the future will adversely affect our revenues and margins.\nOver the past several years, a range of competitive and technological factors, including robust network construction and intense competition, have lowered market prices for many of our products and services. If these market conditions persist, we may need to continue to reduce prices to retain customers and revenue. If future price reductions are necessary, our operating results will suffer unless we are able to offset these reductions by reducing our operating expenses or increasing our sales volumes.\nOur future growth potential will depend in part on the continued development and expansion of the Internet.\nOur future growth potential will depend in part upon the continued development and expansion of the Internet as a communication medium and marketplace for the distribution of data, video and other products by businesses, consumers, and governments. The use of the Internet for these purposes may not grow and expand at the rate anticipated by us or others, or may be restricted by factors outside of our control, including (i) actions by other carriers or governmental authorities that restrict us from delivering traffic over other parties' networks, (ii) changes in regulations, (iii) technological stagnation, (iv) increased concerns regarding cyber threats or (v) changes in customers' preferences or data usage.\nIf we fail to hire and retain qualified executives, managers and employees, our operating results could be harmed.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain executives, managers and employees with technological, engineering, product development, operational, provisioning, marketing, sales, customer service, administrative, managerial and other key skills. There is a shortage of qualified personnel in several of these fields. We compete with several other companies for this limited pool of potential employees. As our industry increasingly becomes more competitive, it could become especially difficult to attract and retain top personnel with skills in high demand. In addition, subject to limited exceptions, none of our executives or domestic employees have long-term employment agreements. For all these reasons, there is no assurance that our efforts to recruit and retain qualified personnel will be successful.\nWe have been accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of others and will likely face similar accusations in the future, which could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or require us to seek third-party licenses.\nLike other communications companies, we have increasingly in recent years received a number of notices from third parties or have been named in lawsuits filed by third parties claiming we have infringed or are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. We are currently responding to several of these notices and claims and expect this industry-wide trend will continue. Responding to these claims may require us to expend significant time and money defending our use of the applicable technology, and divert management\u2019s time and resources away from other business. In certain instances, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements requiring royalty payments. In the case of litigation, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages or cease using the applicable technology. If we are required to take one or more of these actions, our profit margins may decline or our operations could be impaired. In addition, in responding to these claims, we may be required to stop selling or redesign one or more of our products or services, which could significantly and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSimilarly, from time to time, we may need to obtain the right to use certain patents or other intellectual property from third parties to be able to offer new products and services. If we cannot license or otherwise obtain rights to use any required technology from a third party on reasonable terms, our ability to offer new products and services may be prohibited, restricted, made more costly or delayed.\nWe may not be successful in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on various patents, copyrights, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other similar intellectual property rights, as well as confidentiality agreements and procedures, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. The steps we have taken, however, may not prevent unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our technology. Others may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent, superior to, or otherwise competitive to the technologies we employ in our services or that infringe on our intellectual property. We may be unable to prevent competitors from acquiring proprietary rights that are similar to or infringe upon our proprietary rights, or to prevent our current or former employees from using or disclosing to others our proprietary information. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights may depend on initiating legal actions against parties who infringe or misappropriate our proprietary information, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. If we are unsuccessful in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights, our business, competitive position, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur operations, financial performance and liquidity are materially reliant on various third parties.\nReliance on other communications providers. To offer certain services in certain of our markets, we must either purchase services or lease network capacity from, or interconnect our network with the infrastructure of, other communications carriers or cloud companies who typically compete against us in those markets. Our reliance on these supply or interconnection arrangements exposes us to multiple risks. Typically these arrangements limit our control over the quality of our services and expose us to the risk that our ability to market our services could be adversely impacted by changes in the plans or properties of the carriers upon which we are reliant. In addition, we are exposed to the risk that the other carriers may be unwilling or unable to continue or renew these arrangements in the future on terms favorable to us, or at all. This risk is heightened when the other carrier is a competitor who may benefit from terminating the agreement or imposing price increases, or a carrier who suffers financial distress or bankruptcy. If we lose these arrangements and cannot timely replace them, our ability to provide services to our customers and conduct our business could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, many of our arrangements with other carriers are regulated by domestic or foreign agencies, which subjects us to the additional risk that changes in regulation could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our ability to provide services. Finally, even when another carrier agrees or is obligated to provide services to us to permit us to obtain new customers, it is frequently expensive, difficult and time-consuming to switch the new customers to our network, especially if the other carrier fails to provide timely and efficient cooperation.\nConversely, certain of our operations carry a significant amount of data traffic for other communications providers. Their reliance on our services exposes us to risk that they may transfer all or a portion of this traffic from our network to networks built, owned or leased by them, thereby reducing our revenues. For additional information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Business Trends\u201d included in Item 7 of this report.\nOur operations and financial performance could be adversely affected if our relationships with any of these other communications companies are disrupted or terminated for any other reason, including if such other companies:\n\u2022\nbecome bankrupt or experience substantial financial difficulties;\n\u2022\nsuffer work stoppages or other labor strife;\n\u2022\nchallenge our right to receive payments or services under applicable regulations or the terms of our existing contractual arrangements; or\n\u2022\nare otherwise unable or unwilling to make payments or provide services to us.\nReliance on other key suppliers and vendors. We depend on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure, including fiber optic cable, software, optronics, transmission electronics, digital switches and related components. If any of these suppliers experience interruptions or other problems delivering or servicing these network components on a timely basis, our operations could suffer significantly. To the extent that proprietary technology of a supplier is an integral component of our network, we may have limited flexibility to purchase key network components from alternative suppliers and may be adversely affected if third parties assert patent infringement claims against our suppliers or us. We also rely on a limited number of (i) software vendors to support our business management systems, and (ii) contractors to assist us in connection with our network construction and maintenance activities. In the event it becomes necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement supplies, services, utilities or programming on economically attractive terms, on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase costs or cause disruptions in our services.\nReliance on utility providers and landlords. Our energy costs can fluctuate significantly or increase for a variety of reasons, including changes in legislation and regulation. Several pending proposals designed to reduce greenhouse emissions could substantially increase our energy costs, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers.\nWe lease many of our office facilities. Although the majority of these leases provide us with the opportunity to renew the lease, many of these renewal options provide that rent for the renewal period will be equal to the fair market rental rate at the time of renewal. Any resulting increases in our rent costs could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nReliance on governmental payments. We provide products or services to various federal, state and local agencies. Our failure to comply with complex governmental regulations and laws applicable to these programs, or the terms of our governmental contracts, could result in us being suspended or disbarred from future governmental programs or contracts for a significant period of time. Moreover, certain governmental agencies frequently reserve the right to terminate their contracts for convenience. If our governmental contracts are terminated for any reason, or if we are suspended or debarred from governmental programs or contracts, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nViolating our government contracts could have other serious consequences.\nWe provide services to various governmental agencies with responsibility for national security or law enforcement. These governmental contracts impose significant requirements on us relating to network security, information storage and other matters, and in certain instances impose on us additional heightened responsibilities, including requirements related to the composition of our Board of Directors. While we expect to continue to comply fully with all of our obligations under these contracts, we cannot assure you of this. The consequences of violating these contracts could be severe, potentially including the revocation of our FCC licenses in the U.S. (in addition to being suspended or debarred from government contracting, as noted above.)\nPortions of our property, plant and equipment are located on property owned by third parties.\nWe rely on rights-of-way, colocation agreements and other authorizations granted by governmental bodies, railway companies, carriers and other third parties to locate our cable, conduit and other network equipment on or under their respective properties. A significant number of these authorizations are scheduled to lapse over the next five to ten years, unless we are able to extend or renew them. Our operations could be adversely affected if any of these authorizations terminate or lapse, or if the landowner requests price increases.\nOur subsidiaries currently are, and in the past have been, subject to lawsuits challenging the subsidiaries\u2019 use of rights-of-way. Similar suits are possible in the future. Plaintiffs in these suits typically seek to have them certified as class action suits. These suits are typically complex, lengthy and costly to defend, and expose us to each of the other general litigation risks described elsewhere herein.\nOur business customers may seek to shift risk to us.\nWe furnish to and receive from our business customers indemnities relating to damages caused or sustained by us in connection with certain of our operations. Our customers\u2019 changing views on risk allocation could cause us to accept greater risk to win new business or could result in us losing business if we are not prepared to take such risks. To the extent that we accept such additional risk, and seek to insure against it, our insurance premiums could rise.\nOur consolidated revenue is concentrated in a couple top customers.\nAlmost 4% of our combined consolidated revenue is attributable to our top customer, and almost 7% of our consolidated revenue is attributable to our top two customers. If we lost either or both of these customers, or either of them materially decreased its orders for our services, our business would be adversely affected.\nOur international operations expose us to various regulatory, currency, tax, legal and other risks.\nOur international operations are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations regarding operations in international jurisdictions in which we provide services. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include anti-corruption laws, anti-competition laws, trade restrictions, tax laws, immigration laws, privacy laws and accounting requirements. Many of these laws are complex and change frequently. Regulations that require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or the employment of local citizens may adversely affect our flexibility or competitiveness in these jurisdictions. Local laws and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement, differ significantly among those jurisdictions. There is a risk that these laws or regulations may materially restrict our ability to deliver services in various international jurisdictions or could be breached through inadvertence or mistake, fraudulent or negligent behavior of our employees or agents, failure to comply with certain formal documentation or technical requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us or our personnel, or prohibitions on the conduct of our business or our ability to operate in one or more countries, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\nMany non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to communications services are more restrictive than U.S. laws and regulations, particularly those relating to privacy rights and data retention. For example, all 28 member states of the European Union have adopted new European data protection laws that we believe could impact our operations in Europe and could potentially expose us to an increased risk of litigation or significant regulatory fines. Moreover, national regulatory frameworks that are consistent with the policies and requirements of the World Trade Organization have only recently been, or are still being, enacted in many countries. Accordingly, many countries are still in the early stages of providing for and adapting to a liberalized telecommunications market. As a result, in these markets we may encounter more protracted and difficult procedures to obtain licenses necessary to provide the full set of products and services we seek to offer.\nIn addition to these international regulatory risks, some of the other risks inherent in conducting business internationally include:\n\u2022\ntax, licensing, political or other business restrictions or requirements, which may render it more difficult to obtain licenses or interconnection agreements on acceptable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nuncertainty concerning import and export restrictions, including the risk of fines or penalties assessed for violations;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and problems collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulation of overseas operations, including regulation under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and the Brazilian Anti-Corruption Law (collectively the \u201cAnti-Corruption Laws\u201d);\n\u2022\neconomic, social and political instability, with the attendant risks of terrorism, kidnapping, extortion, civic unrest and potential seizure or nationalization of assets;\n\u2022\ncurrency and exchange controls, repatriation restrictions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchallenges in securing and maintaining the necessary physical and telecommunications infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe inability in certain jurisdictions to enforce contract rights either due to underdeveloped legal systems or government actions that result in a deprivation of contract rights;\n\u2022\nincreased risk of cyber-attacks or similar events to our network as we expand our network or interconnect our network with other networks internationally;\n\u2022\nthe inability in certain jurisdictions to adequately protect intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nlaws, policies or practices that restrict with whom we can contract or otherwise limit the scope of operations that can legally or practicably be conducted within any particular country;\n\u2022\npotential submission of disputes to the jurisdiction of a non-U.S. court or arbitration panel;\n\u2022\nreliance on third parties, including those with which we have limited experience;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of unanticipated or increased taxes, increased communications or privacy regulations or other forms of public or governmental regulation that increase our operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in staffing and managing overseas operations.\nMany of these risks are beyond our control, and we cannot predict the nature or the likelihood of the occurrence or corresponding effect of any such events, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our international operations are conducted in countries or regions experiencing corruption or instability, which subjects us to heightened legal and economic risks.\nWe do business and may in the future do additional business in certain countries or regions in which corruption is a serious problem. Moreover, in order to effectively compete in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, it is frequently necessary or required to establish joint ventures, strategic alliances or marketing arrangements with local operators, partners or agents. In certain instances, these local operators, partners or agents may have interests that are not always aligned with ours. Reliance on local operators, partners or agents could expose us to the risk of being unable to control the scope or quality of our overseas services or products, or being held liable under any Anti-Corruption Laws for actions taken by our strategic or local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may not themselves be subject to such anti-corruption laws. Any determination that we have violated the Anti-Corruption Laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation or prospects.\nWe conduct significant operations in regions that have historically experienced high levels of political, economic and social instability, including the Latin American region. Various events in recent years have placed pressures on the stability of the currencies of several Latin American countries in which we operate, including Argentina, Brazil and Colombia. Pressures or volatility in local or regional currencies may adversely affect our customers in this region, which could diminish their ability or willingness to order products or services from us. Several Latin American countries have historically experienced high rates of inflation. Governmental actions taken to curb inflation, coupled with speculation about possible future actions, have in the past contributed to periodic economic uncertainty in many Latin American countries. Similar actions in the future, together with abrupt shifts in governmental administrations, could impede our ability to develop or implement effective business plans in the region. In addition, if high rates of inflation persist, we may not be able to adjust the price of our services sufficiently to offset the effects of inflation on our cost structures in those locations. A high inflation environment would also have negative effects on the level of economic activity and employment and adversely affect our business.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rate risks and currency transfer restrictions and our results may suffer due to currency translations and remeasurements.\nCertain of our current and prospective customers derive their revenue in currencies other than U.S. dollars but are invoiced by us in U.S. dollars. The obligations of customers with substantial revenue in non-U.S. currencies may be subject to unpredictable and indeterminate increases if such currencies depreciate relative to the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, these customers may become subject to exchange control regulations restricting the conversion of their revenue currencies into U.S. dollars. In either event, the affected customers may not be able to pay us in U.S. dollars. Similarly, declines in the value of non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely affect us in several respects, including hampering our ability to market our services to customers whose revenue is denominated in depreciated currencies. In addition, where we issue invoices for our services in currencies other than U.S. dollars, our results of operations may suffer due to currency translations if such currencies depreciate relative to the U.S. dollar and we cannot or do not elect to enter into currency hedging arrangements regarding those payment obligations.\nCertain Latin American economies have experienced shortages in non-U.S. currency reserves and have adopted restrictions on the use of certain mechanisms to expatriate local earnings and convert local currencies into U.S. dollars. Any of these shortages or restrictions may limit or impede our ability to transfer or to convert those currencies into U.S. dollars and to expatriate those funds.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions, including unstable economic and credit markets, could negatively affect our business. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of these general economic conditions, they could adversely affect demand for some of our products and services and could cause customers to shift to lower priced products and services or to delay or forego purchases of our products and services. These conditions impact, in particular, our ability to sell discretionary products or services to business customers that are under pressure to reduce costs or to governmental customers that have suffered substantial budget cuts in recent years. Any one or more of these circumstances could continue to depress our revenues. Also, our customers may encounter financial hardships or may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit, which could negatively impact their ability to make timely payments to us. In addition, as discussed further below, unstable economic and credit markets may preclude us from refinancing maturing debt at terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously benefited, at terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. For these reasons, among others, weak economic conditions could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\nFor additional information about our business and operations, see \"Business\" in Item 1 of this report.\nRisks Relating to Our Recently-Completed Combination with CenturyLink\nWe cannot assure you that our ultimate parent company, CenturyLink, will timely realize the anticipated benefits of the business combination with us.\nOur ultimate parent company, CenturyLink, expects to attain substantial benefits from its November 1, 2017, business combination with us, including enhanced scale, cost savings and the receipt of our net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes. We cannot assure you that CenturyLink will be able to attain these anticipated benefits.\nThe combination poses various risks to CenturyLink and us.\nCenturyLink and we incurred substantial expenses in connection with completing the acquisition of Level 3 on November 1, 2017, and both they and we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating its operations with our operations. For a variety of reasons, the integration process may not be successful. Moreover, in connection with the combination, CenturyLink incurred and assumed a substantial amount of indebtedness. Under the agreements that govern such indebtedness, CenturyLink is bound by various covenants and other provisions that impose restrictions on its ability to operate, and Level 3 Parent's immediate parent has guaranteed CenturyLink\u2019s debt and has secured such guaranty with a first priority interest in substantially all of its assets.\nCenturyLink\u2019s combination with us raises other risks.\nCenturyLink\u2019s combination with us raises additional risks not described above. For additional information, see CenturyLink\u2019s (i) definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on February 13, 2017 and (ii) CenturyLink\u2019s most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K, as updated by its subsequent Exchange Act reports.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are therefore exposed to restrictions on our operations and a variety of risks relating to such regulation.\nGeneral. Our domestic operations are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d), various state utility commissions and occasionally by local agencies. Our non-domestic operations are regulated by supranational groups (such as the European Union), national agencies and, often, state, provincial or local bodies.\nGenerally, we must obtain and maintain certificates of authority or licenses from these bodies in most territories where we offer regulated services. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining or retaining all licenses necessary to carry out our business plan, and, even if we are, the prescribed service standards and conditions imposed on us in connection with obtaining or acquiring control of these licenses may impose on us substantial costs and limitations. We also operate in some areas of the world without licenses, as permitted through relationships with locally-licensed partners.\nWe are subject to numerous requirements and interpretations under various international, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, which are often quite detailed and occasionally in conflict with each other. The regulation of telecommunications networks and services around the world varies widely. In some countries, the range of services we are legally permitted to provide may be limited or may change. As noted above, in other countries existing telecommunications legislation is in development, is subject to currently ongoing proceedings, is unclear or inconsistent, or is applied in an unequal or discriminatory fashion, often in the absence of adjudicative forums that are adequate to address disputes. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that we are always considered to be in compliance with all these requirements at any single point in time (as discussed further elsewhere herein). Our inability or failure to comply with the telecommunications and other laws of one or more countries in which we operate could prevent us from commencing or continuing to provide service therein.\nThe agencies responsible for the enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations may initiate inquiries or actions based on customer complaints or on their own initiative. Even if we are ultimately found to have complied with applicable regulations, such actions or inquiries could create adverse publicity that negatively impacts our business.\nDomestic regulation of the telecommunications industry continues to change, and the regulatory environment varies substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. From time to time carriers or other third parties refuse to pay for certain of our services or challenge our rights to receive certain service payments. Our future revenues, costs, and capital investment could be adversely affected by material changes to or decisions regarding the applicability of government requirements, and we cannot assure you that future regulatory, judicial or legislative activities will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nChanges in the composition and leadership of the FCC, state commissions and other agencies that regulate our business could have significant impacts on our revenues, expenses, competitive position and prospects. Changes in the composition and leadership of these agencies are often difficult to predict, and make future planning more difficult.\nRisks associated with recent changes in regulation. Changes in regulation can have a material impact on our business, revenues or financial performance. Changes over the past couple of decades in federal regulations have substantially impacted our operations. In 2011, the FCC adopted an order providing for a multi-year transition to a regulatory structure that reduces intercarrier compensation charges, redeploys universal service funding to newer technologies, and increases certain end-user charges. These changes have significantly impacted various aspects of our operations, financial results and capital expenditures, including the amount of revenues we collect from our wholesale customers. We expect these impacts will continue in the future. For more information, see \"Business-Regulation\" in Item 1 of this report, and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 of this report.\nMany of the FCC\u2019s regulations adopted in recent years remain subject to judicial review and additional rulemakings, thus increasing the difficulty of determining the ultimate impact of these changes on us and our competitors.\nRisks of higher costs. Existing regulations continue to create significant operating and capital costs for us. Our business also may be impacted by legislation and regulation imposing new or greater obligations related to regulations or laws related to regulating internet services, storing records, bolstering homeland security or cyber security, increasing disaster recovery requirements, minimizing environmental impacts, enhancing privacy, restricting data collection, protecting intellectual property rights of third parties, or addressing other issues that\nimpact our business, including (i) the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which requires communications carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities, and services are able to facilitate authorized electronic surveillance, (ii) the USA Freedom Act, which requires communication companies to store records of communications of their customers, and (iii) laws that have significantly enhanced our responsibilities relating to data security in certain jurisdictions. We expect our compliance costs to increase if future laws or regulations continue to increase our obligations.\nRisks posed by other regulations. All of our operations are also subject to a variety of environmental, safety, health and other governmental regulations. In connection with our current operations, we use, handle and dispose of various hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. In prior decades, certain of our current or former subsidiaries owned or operated, or are alleged to have owned or operated, manufacturing businesses for which we have been notified of certain potential environmental liabilities regarding those past operations. We monitor our compliance with applicable regulations or commitments governing these current and past activities. Although we believe that we are in compliance with these regulations in all material respects, our use, handling and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials, or the prior operations of our predecessors, could expose us to claims or actions that could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFor a discussion of regulatory risks associated with our international operations, see \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Affecting Our Business-Our international operations expose us to various regulatory, currency, tax, legal and other risks.\"\nRegulation of the Internet could limit our ability to operate our broadband business profitably and to manage our broadband facilities efficiently.\nSince the creation of the Internet, there has been extensive debate about whether and how to regulate Internet service providers. A significant number of congressional leaders and various consumer and interest groups have long advocated in favor of extensive regulation. In 2015, the FCC adopted new regulations that regulated broadband services as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. Although those regulations were rescinded in December 2017, opponents of the rescission have judicially challenged this action and will likely continue to advocate in favor of re-instituting extensive regulation. Depending on the content and scope of any such future regulations, the imposition of heightened regulation of our Internet operations could hamper our ability to operate our data networks efficiently, restrict our ability to implement network management practices necessary to ensure quality service, increase the cost of network extensions and upgrades, and otherwise negatively impact our current operations. As the significance of the Internet expands, state, local or foreign governments may adopt new laws or regulations, or apply existing laws and regulations to the Internet. We cannot predict the outcome of any such changes.\nWe may be liable for the material that content providers or distributors distribute over our network.\nThe liability of private network operators for information asserted on or disseminated through their networks is impacted both by changing technology and evolving legal principles that remain unsettled in many jurisdictions. While we disclaim any liability for third-party content in our service contracts, as a private network provider we could be exposed to legal claims relating to third party content stored or transmitted on our networks. Such claims could involve, among others, allegations of defamation, invasion of privacy, copyright infringement, or aiding and abetting restricted activities such as online gambling or pornography. Although we believe our liability for these types of claims is limited, suits against other carriers have been successful and we cannot assure you that our defenses will prevail. If we decide to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to these risks, or if we are required to defend ourselves against these kinds of claims, our operations and financial results could be negatively affected.\nAny adverse outcome in any material litigation of CenturyLink or its affiliates could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results, and our ability to access the capital markets.\nThere are several material proceedings pending against CenturyLink and its affiliates, and certain material proceedings pending against us, as described in Note 14-Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Results of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and could cause significant expenditures and diversion of management attention. We review our litigation accrual liabilities on a quarterly basis, but in accordance with applicable accounting guidelines only establish accrual liabilities when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable and only revise previously-established accrual liabilities when warranted by changes in circumstances, in each case based on then-available information. As such, as of any given date we could have exposure to losses under proceedings as to which no liability has been accrued or as to which the accrued liability is inadequate. For each of these reasons, any of the proceedings described in Note 14, as well as current litigation not described therein or future litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, operating results, and our ability to access the capital markets. We can give you no assurances as to the ultimate impact of these matters on our operating results or financial condition.\nWe are subject to franchising requirements that could impede our expansion opportunities or result in potential fines or penalties.\nWe may be required to obtain from municipal authorities operating franchises to install or expand certain facilities related to our fiber transport operations and certain of our other services. Some of these franchises may require us to pay franchise fees, and may require us to pay fines or penalties if we violate our related contractual commitments. In some cases, certain franchise requirements could delay us in expanding our operations or increase the costs of providing these services.\nWe are exposed to risks arising out of recent legislation affecting U.S. public companies.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and related regulations implemented thereunder, have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time consuming. Any failure to successfully or timely complete annual assessments of our internal controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results or our reputation with investors, lenders or others.\nChanges in any of the above-described laws or regulations may limit our ability to plan, and could subject us to further costs or constraints.\nFrom time to time, the laws or regulations governing us or our customers, or the government\u2019s policy of enforcing those laws or regulations, have changed frequently and materially. The variability of these laws could hamper the ability of us and our customers to plan for the future or establish long-term strategies. Moreover, future changes in these laws or regulations could further increase our operating or compliance costs, or further restrict our operational flexibility, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position, financial condition or prospects.\nFor a more thorough discussion of the regulatory issues that may affect our business, see \"Business-Regulation\" in Item 1 of this report.\nRisks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur high debt levels expose us to a broad range of risks.\nWe continue to carry significant debt. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate principal amount of our consolidated long-term debt, excluding capital leases, was $10.5 billion. As of such date, none of this long-term debt, excluding capital leases, was scheduled to mature prior to December 31, 2020. While we currently believe we will have the financial resources to meet or refinance our obligations when they come due, we cannot fully anticipate our future performance or financial condition, the future condition of the credit markets or the economy generally.\nOur significant levels of debt can adversely affect us in several other respects, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, refinancings or other general corporate purposes, particularly if, as discussed further in the risk factor disclosure below, (i) the ratings assigned to our debt securities by nationally recognized credit rating organizations are revised downward or (ii) we seek capital during periods of turbulent or unsettled market conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, distributions, marketing and other potential growth initiatives;\n\u2022\nhindering our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to plan for or react to changing market, industry, competitive or economic conditions;\n\u2022\nincreasing our future borrowing costs;\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk that third parties will be unwilling or unable to engage in hedging or other financial or commercial arrangements with us;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns, including interest rate increases;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk that we will need to sell assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, or take other unfavorable actions to meet payment obligations; or\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk that we may not timely make all required debt payments, either of which could result in the acceleration of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nThe effects of each of these factors could be intensified if we increase our borrowings.\nA substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, our variable-rate debt will have higher debt service requirements, which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial condition.\nAny failure to make required debt payments could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or raise capital.\nSubject to certain limitations, our current debt agreements and the debt agreements of our subsidiaries allow us to incur additional debt, which could exacerbate the other risks described in this report.\nSubject to certain limitations and restrictions, the current terms of our debt instruments and the debt instruments of our subsidiaries permit us or them to incur additional indebtedness. Incremental borrowings that impose additional financial risks could exacerbate the other risks described in this report.\nWe expect to periodically require financing, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness that we intend to refinance over the next several years, principally through the issuance of debt by Level 3 Financing, Inc. We may also need to obtain additional financing under a variety of other circumstances, including if:\n\u2022\nrevenues and cash provided by operations decline;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions weaken, competitive pressures increase or regulatory requirements change;\n\u2022\nwe undertake substantial capital projects or other initiatives that increase our cash requirements; or\n\u2022\nwe become subject to significant judgments or settlements, including in connection with one or more of the matters discussed in Note 14-Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOur ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position, performance, and credit ratings, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Global financial markets continue to be unpredictable and volatile. Prevailing market conditions could be adversely affected by (i) general market conditions, such as disruptions in domestic or overseas sovereign or corporate debt markets, geo-political instabilities, contractions or limited growth in the economy or other similar adverse economic developments in the U.S. or abroad and (ii) specific conditions in the communications industry. Volatility in the global markets could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously benefited, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nIn addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future will depend in part on the satisfaction of the covenants in our debt instruments, which are discussed further below.\nFor all the reasons mentioned above, we can give no assurance that additional financing for any of these purposes will be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nIf we are unable to make required debt payments or refinance our debt, we would likely have to consider other options, such as selling assets, issuing additional securities, cutting costs or otherwise reducing our cash requirements, or negotiating with our lenders to restructure our applicable debt. Our current and future debt instruments may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to do some of these things on favorable terms, or at all. For these and other reasons, we cannot assure you that we could implement these steps in a sufficient or timely manner, or at all. Moreover, any steps taken to strengthen our liquidity, such as cutting costs, could adversely impact our business or operations.\nWe have a complex debt structure, and our various debt agreements include restrictions and covenants that could (i) limit our ability to conduct operations or borrow additional funds, (ii) restrict our ability to engage in intercompany transactions and (iii) lead to the acceleration of our repayment obligations in certain instances.\nOur debt arrangements contain several significant limitations restricting our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nborrow additional money or issue guarantees for debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends or other distributions to our member;\n\u2022\nmake loans, advances or other investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on assets;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nenter into sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations.\nThese above-listed restrictive covenants could materially adversely affect our ability to operate or expand our business, to pursue strategic transactions, or to otherwise pursue our plans and strategies. Certain of these covenants may significantly restrict our ability to distribute cash to our affiliated entities, or to enter into other transactions among our affiliates.\nOur failure to comply with the above-described restrictive covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our debt repayment obligations. Certain of our debt instruments have cross-acceleration provisions. When present, these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. As noted elsewhere herein, we cannot assure you that we could adequately address any such defaults, cross-defaults or acceleration of our debt payment obligations in a sufficient or timely manner, or at all. For additional information, see \u201c-We expect to periodically require financing, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all\u201d and Note 4-Long-Term Debt.\nAny downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our ability to obtain future financing, increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect the market price of our existing debt securities or otherwise impair our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNationally recognized credit rating organizations have issued credit ratings relating to our long-term debt and the long-term debt of Level 3 Financing, Inc. These ratings are below \u201cinvestment grade\u201d, which results in higher borrowing costs than \"investment grade\" debt as well as reduced marketability of our debt securities. There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to any of these debt securities will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant.\nA downgrade of any of these credit ratings could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the market price of some or all of our outstanding debt or equity securities;\n\u2022\nlimit our access to the capital markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nresult in new or more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur;\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing; and\n\u2022\nimpair our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor more information on the credit ratings of our secured and unsecured debt, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt and Other Financing Arrangements\u201d in Item 7 of this report.\nUnder certain circumstances upon a change of control, we will be obligated to offer to repurchase certain of our outstanding debt securities, which could have certain adverse ramifications.\nIf the credit ratings relating to certain of our currently outstanding long-term debt securities are downgraded in the manner specified thereunder in connection with a \u201cchange of control\u201d of us, then we will be required to offer to repurchase such debt securities. If, due to lack of cash, legal or contractual impediments, or otherwise, we fail to offer to repurchase such debt securities, such failure could constitute an event of default under such debt securities. Any such default could in turn constitute a default under other of our agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at that time.\nOur business requires us to incur substantial capital and operating expenses, which reduce our available free cash flow.\nOur business is capital intensive. We expect to continue to require significant cash to maintain and expand our network to remain competitive.\nWe expect to invest additional capital to expand and enhance our network infrastructure as a result of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in customers' service requirements, including increased demands by customers to transmit larger amounts of data at faster speeds;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances of our competitors; or\n\u2022\nthe development and launch of new services.\nWe may be unable to expand or adapt our network infrastructure to respond to these developments in a timely manner, at a commercially reasonable cost or on terms producing satisfactory returns on our investment.\nIn addition to investing in expanded networks, new products or new technologies, we must from time to time invest capital to convert older systems to simplify and modernize our network. While we believe that our currently planned level of capital expenditures will meet both our maintenance and core growth requirements, this may not be the case if demands on our network continue to accelerate or other circumstances underlying our expectations change. Increased spending could, among other things, adversely affect our operating margins, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nSimilarly, we continue to anticipate incurring substantial operating expenses to support our incumbent services and growth initiatives. We may be unable to sufficiently manage or reduce these costs, even if revenues in some of our lines of business are decreasing. If so, our operating margins will be adversely impacted.\nAs a holding company, we rely on payments from our operating companies to meet our obligations.\nAs a holding company, substantially all of our income and operating cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and their distribution of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans or other payments. As a result, we rely upon our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations, including the payment of amounts owed under our long-term debt. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts owed by us or, subject to limited exceptions for tax-sharing or cash management purposes, to make any funds available to us to repay our obligations, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. State law applicable to our subsidiaries restricts the amount of dividends that they may pay. Restrictions that have been or may be imposed by state regulators, and restrictions imposed by credit instruments or other agreements applicable to certain of our subsidiaries may limit the amount of funds that our subsidiaries are permitted to transfer to us, including the amount of dividends that may be paid to us. Moreover, our rights to receive assets of any subsidiary upon its liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors of that subsidiary, including trade creditors. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of these matters.\nOther Risks\nWe have lent money to CenturyLink, which exposes us to certain risks.\nWe have lent $1.825 billion to CenturyLink. Developments that adversely impact CenturyLink could adversely impact our ability to collect this debt.\nWe face risks from natural disasters, which can disrupt our operations and cause us to incur substantial additional capital and operating costs.\nMany of our facilities are located in areas that subjects them to the risks associated with severe tropical storms, hurricanes and tornadoes, including downed telephone lines, flooded facilities, power outages, fuel shortages, damaged or destroyed property and equipment, and work interruptions. These risks will intensify if and to the extent that climate change renders these adverse weather events more frequent or powerful. Although we maintain property and casualty insurance on our property (excluding our above ground outside plant) and may, under certain circumstances, be able to seek recovery of some additional costs through increased rates, only a portion of our additional costs directly related to such natural disasters have historically been recoverable. We cannot predict whether we will continue to be able to obtain insurance for catastrophic hazard-related damages or, if obtainable and carried, whether this insurance will be adequate to cover our losses. In addition, we expect any insurance of this nature to be subject to substantial deductibles, retentions and coverage exclusions, and the premiums to be based on our loss experience. For all these reasons, any future hazard-related costs and work interruptions could adversely affect our operations and our financial condition.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may adversely affect the financial markets and our business.\nFuture terrorist attacks or armed conflicts may directly affect our physical facilities or those of our customers. These events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets and economy. Any of these occurrences could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf conditions or assumptions differ from the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies or forward-looking statements, our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures could be materially affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which are described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in Item 7 of this report, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that are considered \u201ccritical\u201d because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events or assumptions differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, these events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nWhile frequently presented with numeric specificity, the forward-looking statements that we disseminate from time to time is based on numerous variables and assumptions (including, but not limited to, those related to industry performance and competition and general business, economic, market and financial conditions and additional matters specific to our business, as applicable) that are inherently subjective and speculative and are largely beyond our control. As a result, actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Similarly, to adjust to evolving market conditions, we may change our intentions, strategies or plans at any time, which could materially alter our actual results from those previously anticipated. For additional information, see \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Related Matters\" in Item 1 of this report.\nLapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our operations, profitability or reputation.\nThere can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in the future or that we will not experience a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, including litigation brought by private individuals, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence and our stock price.\nIf our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings and reduce our member's/stockholders' equity.\nAs of December 31, 2017, over 60% of our total consolidated assets reflected on the consolidated balance sheet included in this report consisted of goodwill, customer relationships and other intangible assets. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, most of these intangible assets must be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. From time to time, CenturyLink has recorded large non-cash charges to earnings in connection with required reductions of the value of its intangible assets. If our intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we may be required to record additional significant, non-cash charges to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined to have occurred. Any such charges could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition or ability to comply with financial covenants in our debt instruments.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have a substantial impact on us.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was signed into law. The Tax Act significantly changes U.S. tax law by reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, making certain changes to U.S. taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries, capital expenditures, interest expense and various other items. Although we generally believe the net impact of this Tax Act will be favorable to us, the Tax Act is quite complex and certain of its features are expected to adversely impact us. Our views on the Tax Act\u2019s ultimate impact on us are subject to change as we complete additional analysis, review regulations that will need to be adopted to implement the Tax Act and monitor other future developments related to the Tax Act\u2019s adoption.\nAdditional changes in tax laws or tax audits could adversely affect us.\nLike all large businesses, we are subject to frequent and regular audits by the Internal Revenue Service as well as state and local tax authorities. These audits could subject us to tax liabilities if adverse positions are taken by these tax authorities.\nWe believe that we have adequately provided for tax contingencies. However, our tax audits and examinations may result in tax liabilities that differ materially from those that we have recognized in our consolidated financial statements. Because the ultimate outcomes of all of these matters are uncertain, we can give no assurance as to whether an adverse result from one or more of them will have a material effect on our financial results.\nLegislators and regulators at all levels of government may from time to time change existing tax laws or regulations or enact new laws or regulations that could negatively impact our operating results or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 85991, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "LVLT"}
