RISK FACTORS.\nGeneral Business and Operational Risks\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our businesses.\nOur businesses are affected by general economic conditions. In particular, growth in the regulated utilities\u2019 service areas in Florida and New Mexico is important to the realization of annual energy sales growth for Tampa Electric, PGS and NMGC. Any weakening of economic conditions could adversely affect our utilities\u2019 expected performance and their ability to collect payments from customers.\nOur electric and gas utilities are highly regulated; changes in regulation or the regulatory environment could reduce revenues or increase costs or competition.\nOur electric and gas utilities operate in highly regulated industries. Their retail operations, including the prices charged, are regulated by the FPSC in Florida and the NMPRC in New Mexico, and Tampa Electric\u2019s wholesale power sales and transmission services are subject to regulation by the FERC. Changes in regulatory requirements or adverse regulatory actions could have an adverse effect on our utilities\u2019 financial performance by, for example, reducing revenues, increasing competition or costs, threatening investment recovery or impacting rate structure.\nIf Tampa Electric or PGS earn returns on equity above their respective allowed ranges, the earnings could be subject to review by the FPSC which could result in refunds to customers, which could reduce earnings and cash flow.\nVarious factors relating to the integration of NMGC could adversely affect our business and operations.\nBased on the completion of the permanent financing for the NMGC acquisition, we currently expect NMGC to be accretive to earnings for the full-year 2015 period. However, the anticipated accretion to earnings from NMGC during this integration period is based on estimates of synergies from the transaction and growth in the New Mexico economy, which are dependent on local and global economic conditions and other factors, which may materially change, including:\n\u00b7\nour estimate of NMGC\u2019s expected operating performance after the completion of the transaction may vary significantly from actual results;\n\u00b7\nOver time, we will be making significant capital investments to convert several NMGC computer systems to the systems that we use in Florida. These conversions may not be accomplished on time or on budget, which would increase costs for NMGC. In addition, the time required to convert these systems will cause NMGC to operate the existing systems past the end of their normal lives, which could reduce reliability.\n\u00b7\nthe potential loss of key employees of TECO Energy or NMGC who may be uncertain about their future roles in the TECO Energy / NMGC organization.\nNegative impacts from these factors could have an adverse effect on the anticipated benefits of the transaction or our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant integration costs in connection with the NMGC acquisition.\nWe incurred significant transaction costs in connection with the execution and consummation of the NMGC acquisition as well as the related financing transactions. In addition, we are in the process of integrating NMGC into TECO Energy following the closing of the NMGC acquisition on Sept. 2, 2014. Although we anticipate achieving synergies in connection with the NMGC acquisition, we also expect to incur costs to achieve these synergies. In 2014, we incurred transaction and integration costs in connection with the NMGC acquisition of $16.6 million. We anticipate that we will incur additional non-recurring charges in connection with this integration, including charges associated with integrating processes and systems. At this time, we cannot identify the timing, nature and amount of all such additional charges. We have identified some, but not all, of the actions necessary to achieve our anticipated synergies. Accordingly, the synergies expected from the acquisition of NMGC may not be achievable in our anticipated amount or timeframe or at all.\nChanges in the environmental laws and regulations affecting our businesses could increase our costs or curtail our activities.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities dealing with air, water and other environmental matters. Changes in compliance requirements or the interpretation by governmental authorities of existing requirements may impose additional costs on us or require us to curtail some of our businesses\u2019 activities.\nProposed regulations on the disposal and/or storage of CCRs could add to Tampa Electric\u2019s operating costs.\nIn response to a coal ash pond failure in December 2008 at another utility, the EPA proposed new regulations for the management and disposal of CCRs. A preliminary draft of the final rule was issued in December 2014, which designated CCRs as non-hazardous wastes. The designation of CCRs as non-hazardous waste in the preliminary draft of the final rule allows for the continued operation of ash impoundments on Tampa Electric\u2019s facilities; however, this designation may impose additional administrative and compliance requirements, which could increase costs.\nIt is expected that the rules, once made final, will be subjected to litigation, which could have a material impact on both the content and the timing of the implementation of the rules. Accordingly, the outcome of this rule-making process and its impact on our businesses cannot be determined at this time. While certain costs related to environmental compliance are currently recoverable from customers under Florida\u2019s ECRC, we cannot be assured that any increased costs associated with complying with those regulations will be eligible for such treatment.\nFederal or state regulation of GHG emissions, depending on how they are enacted, could increase our costs or the rates charged to our customers, which could curtail sales.\nAmong our companies, Tampa Electric has the most significant number of stationary sources with air emissions. While GHG emission regulations have been proposed, both at the federal level and in various states, none has been passed at this time and, therefore, costs to reduce GHGs are unknown. Presently there is no viable technology to remove CO2 post-combustion from\nconventional coal-fired units such as Tampa Electric\u2019s Big Bend units. New rules requiring post-combustion CO2 removal could require significant investment in what is essentially experimental technology, costly conversion to natural gas fuel, or a premature shut-down of the units, which would result in non-cash write-offs.\nCurrent regulation in Florida allows utility companies to recover from customers prudently incurred costs for compliance with new state or federal environmental regulations. Tampa Electric would expect to recover from customers the costs of power plant modifications or other costs required to comply with new GHG emission regulation. If the regulation allowing cost recovery is changed and the cost of compliance is not recovered through the ECRC, Tampa Electric could seek to recover those costs through a base-rate proceeding, but we cannot be assured that the FPSC would grant such recovery.\nIn a June 25, 2013, memorandum, President Obama directed the EPA to issue new emissions standards for future power plants as well as modified, reconstructed or existing power plants to reduce GHG emissions. The new standards, which were released in the fall of 2013, essentially mandate that no new coal fired power plants will be constructed in the U.S. On June 2, 2014, the EPA released a comprehensive proposed rule which it calls the \u201cClean Power Plan,\u201d aiming to cut GHG emissions from existing power plants by 30% from their 2005 levels by 2030, with an interim goal for the period from 2020 through 2029. Under the proposed rule, each state would have to reduce CO2 emissions on a state-wide basis by an amount specified by the EPA. The EPA determined the target amount for each state based on its view of each state\u2019s options, including: making power plant efficiency upgrades; shifting from coal to natural gas generation; investing in zero- and low-emitting power sources, such as renewable and nuclear energy; and implementing customer energy efficiency programs. Because the 30% reduction target is an average across all states, some states have higher or lower target emission reduction goals under the proposed rule than the average. Based on current emissions, Florida has a reduction goal of 38%, which is higher than the national average. Under the proposed rules, states will have flexibility in designing programs to meet their emission reduction targets, including the four approaches noted above or any other measures they choose to adopt, for example, carbon tax and cap-and-trade. The EPA is scheduled to finalize the rule by June 1, 2015, and states will have until June 30, 2016, to submit plans to achieve their target emission reductions (subject to extension and EPA approval of the states\u2019 plans). It is unclear whether Florida\u2019s proposed implementation plan will take into consideration emission reductions achieved prior to 2005 or if that baseline year will be changed in the comment process. The 2005 baseline year does not take into consideration the significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions we achieved prior to 2005 (a reduction of approximately five million tons since 1998). If the 2005 baseline year remains unchanged (which due to our previous reductions in greenhouse gas emissions was our lowest emitting year), it may be more difficult for us to achieve the proposed reductions than other utilities in a cost-effective manner, especially when compared to utilities in other states that have lower emission reduction targets under the proposed rules. It is expected that the rules will be subjected to litigation, which could have a material impact on both the content and the timing of the implementation of the rules. Accordingly, the outcome of this rule-making process and its impact on our businesses cannot be determined at this time; however, it could result in increased operating costs, or decreased operations at Tampa Electric\u2019s coal-fired plants. While certain costs related to environmental compliance are currently recoverable from customers under Florida\u2019s ECRC, we cannot be assured that any increased costs associated with complying with those regulations will be eligible for such treatment.\nAmong other rules, the EPA has proposed or finalized a number of new rules, including the CAIR/CSAPR and Hazardous Air Pollutants (\u201cHAPS\u201d) Maximum Achievable Control Technology (\u201cMACT\u201d) for emissions into the air, and a number of new rules focused on water use and discharges from power generation facilities.\nThese air focused rules impose stringent reductions in several pollutants from electric utility steam generators, primarily coal-fired, but including oil-fired as well. If the CSAPR rule is implemented as planned, the EPA has estimated that the implementation of CSAPR would require significant investment in pollution-control equipment for units not already equipped or could result in the retirement of primarily smaller, older coal-fired power stations that do not currently have state-of-the-art air pollution-control equipment already installed. The retirement of these units or switching to other fuels for compliance with this rule is likely to reduce overall demand for coal, which could reduce sales and financial results at TECO Coal.\nThe EPA\u2019s proposed water focused rules could limit the supply of water available to our power generating facilities, which would require us to invest significant capital in new equipment and would increase our operating costs.\nA mandatory RPS could add to Tampa Electric\u2019s costs and adversely affect its operating results.\nIn past sessions of the Florida Legislature, an RPS was debated but ultimately not enacted; however, an RPS standard could be enacted in the future. In addition, there is the potential that legislation could be proposed in the U.S. Congress to introduce an RPS at the federal level. It remains unclear if or when action on such legislation would be completed. Tampa Electric could incur significant costs to comply with an RPS, and Tampa Electric\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected if Tampa Electric were not permitted to recover these costs from customers through the ECRC.\nThe nation is increasingly dependent on natural gas to generate electricity and as an alternative to higher cost petroleum fuels. There may not be adequate infrastructure to deliver adequate quantities of natural gas to meet the expected future demand, and the expected higher demand for natural gas may lead to increasing costs for the commodity.\nIn the United States, utilities are increasingly relying on natural gas for new electric generating plants in response to GHG emissions concerns and attractive natural gas prices. Industrial customers and vehicle fleets are converting to natural gas based on attractive economics and lower emissions. Currently, there is an adequate supply and infrastructure to meet demand for natural gas in Florida and nationally. However, if future supplies are inadequate or if significant new investment is required to install the pipelines necessary to transport the gas, the cost of natural gas could rise.\nCurrently, our electric and gas utilities are allowed to pass the cost for the commodity gas and transportation services to customers without profit. Changes in commodity gas cost recovery regulations could reduce earnings if they required Tampa Electric, PGS or NMGC to bear a portion of the increased cost. In addition, increased costs to customers could result in lower sales.\nOur businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and the effects of extreme weather, and have seasonal variations.\nAll of our businesses are affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather. Energy sales by our electric and gas utilities are particularly sensitive to variations in weather conditions. Those companies forecast energy sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long-term historical average. If climate change or other factors cause significant variations from normal weather, this could have a material impact on energy sales.\nPGS and NMGC, which typically have short but significant winter peak periods that are dependent on cold weather, are more weather-sensitive than Tampa Electric, which has both summer and winter peak periods. NMGC typically earns all of its net income in the first and fourth quarters, due to winter weather. Mild winter weather can negatively impact results at Tampa Electric, PGS and NMGC.\nThe state of Florida is exposed to extreme weather, including hurricanes, which can cause damage to our facilities and affect our ability to serve customers. There is the potential for gas customer service interruptions and system reliability problems during periods of extreme cold weather in New Mexico.\nAs a company with electric service and natural gas operations in peninsular Florida, we are exposed to extreme weather events, such as hurricanes. Extreme weather conditions can be destructive, causing outages and property damage that require the company to incur additional expenses. Extensive customer outages could reduce revenue collections. If warmer temperatures lead to changes in extreme weather events (increased frequency, duration and severity), these expenses could be greater.\nWhile the company has storm preparation and recovery plans in place, and Tampa Electric and PGS have historically been granted regulatory approval to recover or defer the majority of significant storm costs incurred, extreme weather still poses risks to our operations and storm cost-recovery petitions may not always be granted or may not be granted in a timely manner. If costs associated with future severe weather events cannot be recovered in a timely manner, or in an amount sufficient to cover actual costs, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn the past, in New Mexico supplies of natural gas from natural gas wells have been disrupted and interstate pipelines were unable to reliably deliver gas during periods of extreme cold weather, which caused retail customer service interruptions; and these types of disruptions could occur in the future. NMGC is evaluating significant capital investments to ensure reliable supplies of natural gas for its customers if such interruptions occur again. Future service interruptions could lead to customer lawsuits or cause NMGC to make additional capital investments, which could raise costs to customers.\nNMGC operates high-pressure natural gas transmission pipelines, which involve risks that may result in accidents or otherwise affect our operations.\nThere are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent in operating high-pressure natural gas transmission pipelines, such as leaks, explosions, mechanical problems, activities of third parties and damage to pipelines, facilities and equipment caused by floods, fires and other natural disasters that could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in significant injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of operations, any of which could result in substantial losses. For pipeline assets located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, known as High Consequence Areas (HCAs) the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater. We do not maintain insurance coverage against all of these risks and losses, and any insurance coverage we might maintain may not fully cover the damages caused by those risks and losses. Therefore, should any of these risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, earnings, financial condition and cash flows.\nNMGC\u2019s high-pressure transmission pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase our cost of operations and affect or limit our business plans.\nOur pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety regulation administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the DOT. These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our pipelines. These regulations, among other things, include requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines. The regulations determine the pressures at which our pipelines can operate.\nPHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand pipeline integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. Pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have a material adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition and cash flows.\nCommodity price changes may affect the operating costs and competitive positions of our businesses.\nAll of our businesses are sensitive to changes in coal, gas, oil and other commodity prices. Any changes could affect the prices these businesses charge, their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services.\nIn the case of Tampa Electric, fuel costs used for generation are affected primarily by the cost of coal and natural gas. Tampa Electric is able to recover prudently incurred costs of fuel through retail customers\u2019 bills, but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and, therefore, the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources.\nThe ability to make sales and the margins earned on wholesale power sales are affected by the cost of fuel to Tampa Electric, particularly as it compares to the costs of other power producers.\nIn the case of PGS and NMGC, costs for purchased gas and pipeline capacity are recovered through retail customers\u2019 bills, but increases in gas costs affect total retail prices and, therefore, the competitive position of PGS and NMGC relative to electricity, other forms of energy and other gas suppliers.\nResults at our companies may be affected by changes in customer energy-usage patterns.\nFor the past several years, at Tampa Electric, and electric utilities across the country, weather-normalized electricity consumption per residential customer declined due to the combined effects of voluntary conservation efforts, economic conditions, improvements in lighting and appliance efficiency, trends toward smaller single family houses and increased multi-family housing.\nForecasts by our companies are based on normal weather patterns and historical trends in customer energy-usage patterns. The ability of our utilities to increase energy sales and earnings could be negatively impacted if customers continue to use less energy in response to increased energy efficiency, economic conditions or other factors.\nOur computer systems and the infrastructure of our utility companies may be subject to cyber (primarily electronic or internet-based) or physical attacks, which could disrupt operations, cause loss of important data or compromise customer, employee-related or other critical information or systems, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results and condition.\nThere have been an increasing number of cyber-attacks on companies around the world, which have caused operational failures or compromised sensitive corporate or customer data. These attacks have occurred over the Internet, through malware, viruses, attachments to e-mails, through persons inside of the organization or through persons with access to systems inside of the organization.\nWe have security systems and infrastructure in place that are designed to prevent such attacks, and these systems are subject to internal, external and regulatory audits to ensure adequacy. Despite these efforts, we cannot be assured that a cyber-attack will not cause electric or gas system operational problems, disruptions of service to customers, compromise important data or systems, or subject us to additional regulation, litigation or damage to our reputation.\nThere have also been physical attacks on critical infrastructure at other utilities. While the transmission and distribution system infrastructure of our utility companies are designed and operated in such a manner to mitigate the impact of this type of attack, in the event of a physical attack that disrupts service to customers, revenues would be reduced and costs would be incurred to repair any damage. These types of events, either impacting our facilities or the industry in general, could also cause us to incur additional security- and insurance-related costs, and could have adverse effects on our business and financial results and condition.\nWe rely on some natural gas transmission assets that we do not own or control to deliver natural gas. If transmission is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver natural gas and supply natural gas to our electric generating stations may be hindered.\nWe depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by other utilities and energy companies to deliver the natural gas we sell to the wholesale and retail markets, as well as the natural gas we purchase for use in our electric generation facilities. If transmission is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver products and satisfy our contractual and service obligations may be hindered.\nPotential competitive changes may adversely affect our regulated electric and gas businesses.\nThere is competition in wholesale power sales across the country. Some states have mandated or encouraged competition at the retail level and, in some situations, required divestiture of generating assets. While there is active wholesale competition in Florida, the retail electric business has remained substantially free from direct competition. Although not expected in the foreseeable future, changes in the competitive environment occasioned by legislation, regulation, market conditions or initiatives of other electric power providers, particularly with respect to retail competition, could adversely affect Tampa Electric\u2019s business and its expected performance.\nThe gas distribution industry has been subject to competitive forces for several years. Gas services provided by our gas utilities are unbundled for all non-residential customers. Because our gas utilities earn margins on distribution of gas but not on the commodity itself, unbundling has not negatively impacted their results. However, future structural changes that we cannot predict could adversely affect PGS and NMGC.\nIncreased customer use of distributed generation could adversely affect our regulated electric utility business.\nIn many areas of the country there is growing use of rooftop solar panels, small wind turbines and other small-scale methods of power generation, called distributed generation, by individual residential, commercial and industrial customers. Distributed generation is encouraged and supported by various special interest groups, tax incentives, renewable portfolio standards and special rates designed to support such generation. Additionally, the EPA\u2019s proposed \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d rule, if enacted as proposed, could have the effect of providing greater incentives for distributed generation in order to meet state-based emission reduction targets under the proposed rule. See \u201cFederal or state regulation of GHG emissions depending on how they are enacted, could increase our costs or the rates charged to our customers, which could curtail sales.\u201d\nIncreased usage of distributed generation, particularly in those states where solar or wind resources are the most abundant, is reducing utility electricity sales but not reducing the need for ongoing investment in infrastructure to maintain or expand the transmission and distribution grid to reliably serve customers. Continued utility investment not supported by increased energy sales causes rates to increase for customers, which could further reduce energy sales and reduce profitability.\nThere is proposed legislation to potentially be debated in the 2015 Florida legislative session, and there is a potential for an amendment to the Florida constitution to be on the ballot in 2016 that would promote increased use of solar energy to generate electricity.\nProposed action by the Florida legislature in 2015 and a potential amendment to the Florida constitution in 2016 would encourage the installation of solar arrays to generate electricity by retail customers and third parties, and to allow sales of electricity by non-utility generators. Increased use of solar generation and sales by third parties would reduce energy sales and revenues at Tampa Electric. In addition, Tampa Electric could make investments in facilities to serve customers during periods that solar energy is not available that would not be profitable.\nThe value of our existing deferred tax benefits are determined by existing tax laws, and could be negatively impacted by changes in these laws.\n\u201cComprehensive tax reform\u201d remains a topic of discussion in the U.S. Congress. Such legislation could significantly alter the existing tax code, including a reduction in corporate income tax rates. Although a reduction in the corporate income tax rate could result in lower future tax expense and tax payments, it would reduce the value of our existing deferred tax asset and could result in a charge to earnings from the write-down of that asset, and would reduce future cash flow at the parent company.\nImpairment testing of certain long-lived assets could result in impairment charges.\nWe assess long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of those assets below their carrying values. To the extent the value of goodwill or a long-lived asset becomes impaired, we may be required to record non-cash impairment charges that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results from operations. In connection with the NMGC acquisition, we recorded additional goodwill and long-lived assets that could become impaired.\nFinancing Risks\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition and financial flexibility.\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which has resulted in fixed charges we are obligated to pay. The level of our indebtedness and restrictive covenants contained in our debt obligations could limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nTECO Energy, TECO Finance, TEC, NMGC and NMGI must meet certain financial covenants as defined in the applicable agreements to borrow under their respective credit facilities. Also, TECO Energy and its subsidiaries have certain restrictive covenants in specific agreements and debt instruments. See the Credit Facilities section and Significant Financial Covenants table in the Liquidity, Capital Resources sections of the Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis for descriptions of these covenants.\nAlthough we were in compliance with all required financial covenants as of Dec. 31, 2014, we cannot assure compliance with these financial covenants in the future. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet our payment obligations could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of other outstanding debt obligations. We may not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy our debt obligations in the event of an acceleration of all or a portion of our outstanding obligations.\nWe also incur obligations in connection with the operations of our subsidiaries and affiliates that do not appear on our balance sheet. These obligations take the form of guarantees, letters of credit and contractual commitments, as described under the Liquidity, Capital Resources sections of the Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis.\nFinancial market conditions could limit our access to capital and increase our costs of borrowing or refinancing, or have other adverse effects on our results.\nTECO Finance and TEC have debt maturing in 2015 and subsequent years which they may need to refinance. Future financial market conditions could limit our ability to raise the capital we need and could increase our interest costs, which could reduce earnings. If we are not able to issue new debt, or we issue debt at interest rates higher than we expect, our financial results or condition could be adversely affected.\nWe enter into derivative transactions, primarily with financial institutions as counterparties. Financial market turmoil could lead to a sudden decline in credit quality among these counterparties, which could make in-the-money positions uncollectable.\nWe enter into derivative transactions with counterparties, most of which are financial institutions, to hedge our exposure to commodity price and interest rate changes. Although we believe we have appropriate credit policies in place to manage the non-performance risk associated with these transactions, turmoil in the financial markets could lead to a sudden decline in credit quality among these counterparties. If such a decline occurs for a counterparty with which we have an in-the-money position, we could be unable to collect from such counterparty.\nDeclines in the financial markets or in interest rates used to determine benefit obligations could increase our pension expense or the required cash contributions to maintain required levels of funding for our plan.\nUnder calculation requirements of the Pension Protection Act, as of the Jan. 1, 2015 measurement date, our pension plan was essentially fully funded. Under MAP 21, we are not required to make additional cash contributions over the next five years; however we may make additional cash contributions from time to time. Any future declines in the financial markets or further declines in interest rates could increase the amount of contributions required to fund our pension plan in the future, and could cause pension expense to increase.\nOur financial condition and results could be adversely affected if our capital expenditures are greater than forecast.\nWe are forecasting capital expenditures at Tampa Electric to support the current levels of customer growth, to comply with the design changes mandated by the FPSC to harden transmission and distribution facilities against hurricane damage, to maintain transmission and distribution system reliability, to maintain coal-fired generating unit reliability and efficiency, and to add generating capacity at the Polk Power Station. We are forecasting capital expenditures at PGS to support customer growth, system reliability,\nconversion of customers from other fuels to natural gas and to replace bare steel and cast iron pipe. Forecasted capital expenditures at NMGC are expected to support customer and system reliability and expansion.\nIf our capital expenditures exceed the forecasted levels, we may need to draw on credit facilities or access the capital markets on unfavorable terms. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain additional financing, in which case our financial position could be adversely affected.\nOur financial condition and ability to access capital may be materially adversely affected by multiple ratings downgrades to below investment grade, and we cannot be assured of any rating improvements in the future.\nOur senior unsecured debt is rated as investment grade by S&P at BBB, by Moody\u2019s Investor\u2019s Services (Moody\u2019s) at Baa1, and by Fitch Ratings (Fitch) at BBB. The senior unsecured debt of TEC is rated by S&P at BBB+, by Moody\u2019s at A2 and by Fitch at A-. The senior unsecured debt of NMGC is rated by S&P at BBB+. A downgrade to below investment grade by the rating agencies, which would require a two-notch downgrade by S&P and Fitch, and a three notch downgrade by Moody\u2019s, may affect our ability to borrow, may change requirements for future collateral or margin postings, and may increase our financing costs, which may decrease our earnings. We may also experience greater interest expense than we may have otherwise if, in future periods, we replace maturing debt with new debt bearing higher interest rates due to any such downgrades. In addition, downgrades could adversely affect our relationships with customers and counterparties.\nAt current ratings, TEC and NMGC are able to purchase electricity and gas without providing collateral. If the ratings of TEC or NMGC decline to below investment grade, Tampa Electric, PGS or NMGC could be required to post collateral to support their purchases of electricity and gas.\nWe are a holding company with no business operations of our own and depend on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe are a holding company with no business operations of our own or material assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we require dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to meet our cash requirements. If our subsidiaries are unable to pay us dividends or make other cash payments to us, we may be unable to pay dividends or satisfy our obligations.\nTECO COAL\nDuring the period of ownership prior to the completion of the sale of TECO Coal, we retain the risks of ownership of that business.\nAny failure of the pending sale of TECO Coal would likely alter certain aspects of our current business plans and could adversely affect our business and the value of TECO Coal.\nOn Oct. 17, 2014, TECO Diversified entered into an agreement to sell all of its ownership interest in TECO Coal to Cambrian Coal Corp., and on Feb. 5, 2015 amended that agreement. The sale is subject to certain closing conditions, including the purchaser\u2019s obtaining suitable financing. In accordance with the terms of the amended securities purchase agreement, we expect to realize approximately $80 million in initial gross proceeds from the sale, plus contingent payments of up to $60 million over the next five years depending on specified coal benchmark prices. There can be no assurances that we will realize any additional proceeds from these potential contingent payments. If certain closing conditions are not met by March 13, 2015 , either party may choose not to proceed with the sale.\nIn anticipation of the pending sale transaction, we have presented the financial results of TECO Coal in this annual report as discontinued operations and included charges totaling $76.4 million after-tax to write-down the carrying value of TECO Coal to the estimated fair value of the business as of Dec. 31, 2014. In the event that the TECO Coal sale transaction is not consummated on the terms contemplated by the sale agreement or at all, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe coal markets continued to weaken in 2014 and it is likely that TECO Coal\u2019s operations will result in a loss in 2015. If the pending sale of TECO Coal is not consummated, TECO Coal\u2019s expected 2015 losses would have an adverse effect on TECO Energy\u2019s consolidated financial results and potentially our stock price. In addition, if the pending sale is not consummated, the value of TECO Coal\u2019s assets might be further impaired, and we may not be able to realize the proceeds expected from the current transaction in a subsequent sale transaction.\nBelow are additional risks associated with TECO Coal, which could impact our results in the event the sale is not completed.\nCompetition among coal producers in Central Appalachia and other producing regions, and low natural gas prices, may adversely affect TECO Coal\u2019s ability to sell steam coal. Low-cost natural gas has allowed utility steam coal users to switch from coal to natural gas to produce electricity, which has reduced the current market price and demand for TECO Coal\u2019s steam coal from domestic utilities. If we continue to own TECO Coal, continued or further declines in natural gas prices and increased competition from lower cost producing areas would keep demand and selling prices low, which would reduce TECO Coal\u2019s financial results, and could further reduce the value of its reserves.\nTECO Coal has historically sold a significant portion of its production to domestic utilities for use in the generation of power. For over three years, natural gas prices have been dramatically lower than in previous periods due to the growth of hydraulic fracturing in the production of natural gas from shale formations. These low natural gas prices have caused utility coal users to switch to lower cost natural gas to generate electricity. Lower cost coals from other producing regions of the U.S., such as the Powder River Basin and the Illinois Basin are being utilized by more utilities in lieu of higher cost Central Appalachian coals, further reducing demand for TECO Coal\u2019s production.\nIn the current coal markets, prices for Central Appalachian steam coal are not profitable. Without an increase in the cost of natural gas and an increase in the use of coal for power generation, or a general improvement in coal market conditions, TECO Coal could sign coal sales contracts at lower than earnings break even or cash cost of production prices or production could be reduced, either of which would cause its financial results to be reduced. If these conditions were to persist or decline further, the value of TECO Coal\u2019s reserves could be further reduced, which could result in an additional non-cash impairment charge.\nFailure to obtain the permits necessary to open new surface mines, or challenges to the validity of existing permits, could adversely affect TECO Coal\u2019s financial results.\nOur surface coal mining operations are dependent on permits from the USACE to open new surface mines necessary to maintain or increase production. Since 2008, new permits issued by the USACE under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act for new surface coal mining operations have been challenged in court by various environmental groups, resulting in very few usable permits being issued. Failure to obtain the necessary permits to open new surface mines, which are required to maintain and expand production, could reduce production, cause higher mining costs or require purchasing coal at prices above our cost of production to fulfill contract requirements, which would adversely affect TECO Coal\u2019s financial results.\nChallenges to existing permits that disrupt mining operations could result in higher costs if operations are forced to move to other mining sites or if coal is purchased from third parties, which would adversely affect TECO Coal\u2019s financial results.\nIn 2010, the EPA issued new guidelines related to water quality for Central Appalachian coal surface mining operations that would be conditions of new surface mine permits, which would add significant cost to operations or curtail our surface mining activities and preparation plant operations.\nIn 2010, the EPA issued new guidance on environmental permitting requirements for Central Appalachian mountaintop removal and other surface mining projects. This guidance, which was made final by the EPA in 2011, limits conductivity (level of mineral salts) in water discharges into streams from permitted areas, and was effective immediately on an interim basis. Because the EPA\u2019s standards appear to be unachievable under most circumstances, surface mining activity could be substantially curtailed since most new and pending permits would likely be rejected. This guidance could also be extended to discharges from deep mines and preparation plants, which could result in a substantial curtailing of those activities as well. In 2012, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the EPA had exceeded its statutory authority in establishing the water quality guidance discussed above. Following the outcome of this court decision, pending appeals by the EPA, few, if any, new usable permits have been issued by the USACE. Over time, if new permits are not issued, TECO Coal could incur higher production costs or reduced production from surface mining operations.\nTECO Coal\u2019s sales to international customers are subject to risks that could result in losses or increased costs.\nTECO Coal is exposed to financial risk through its sales to international customers, primarily in Asia. TECO Coal attempts to mitigate this risk through the use of third parties to broker the sales, dollar-denominated contracts, passage of title upon loading in the U.S. port, customer responsibility for the international freight, letters of credit posted by customers for purchase price of the commodity and the transportation to the U.S. port, and the utilization of local agents where appropriate. TECO Coal cannot be assured that these measures will effectively mitigate all international risks, which could have an adverse effect on TECO Coal\u2019s financial conditions.\nIn 2015, TECO Coal expects to continue to sell metallurgical coal to customers in Asia. Prices for metallurgical coal sales to Asia are subject to being reset each quarter based on levels of supply and demand in the region. Over the past three years, the quarterly prices have been lower due to increased supply from Australia and other suppliers and weakening demand for metallurgical coal from China. In the first quarter of 2015, prices are currently below levels that make sales to these markets profitable. If these quarterly prices persist, TECO Coal\u2019s production and financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe U.S. federal government has proposed the elimination of the percentage depletion tax deduction for the mining of coal, and other hard minerals and fossil fuels which could result in an increase to our tax rate.\nIf the percentage depletion tax deduction is eliminated for TECO Coal, its effective tax rate would rise from the historical range of 20% to 25% to the general corporate tax rate of 37%, which would reduce financial results at TECO Coal.", "PERMNO": 37161, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "TE"}
