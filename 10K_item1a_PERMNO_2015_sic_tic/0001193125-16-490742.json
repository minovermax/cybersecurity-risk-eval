Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred net losses in every year since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical-stage oncology company with a limited operating history. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $53.3 million and $23.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $534.2 million. Investment in oncology product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue to date, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue the development of our lead product candidate, PNT2258, further research and develop our DNAi technology platform, seek to identify additional product candidates, seek regulatory approval, prepare for potential commercialization and operate as a public company.\nEven if we succeed in commercializing PNT2258 or any future product candidates we may develop, we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional product candidates. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit) and working capital.\nOur business is highly dependent on the success of our only clinical product candidate, PNT2258. If we are unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize PNT2258, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur business and future success depends on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our only clinical product candidate, PNT2258, which is at an early stage of development. We have invested significant effort and financial resources in the research and development of PNT2258, and PNT2258 will require significant additional clinical testing before we can seek regulatory approval and potentially launch commercial sales. Further development of PNT2258 will require additional clinical development, regulatory review and approval in multiple jurisdictions, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenue from product sales, if approved.\nWe cannot commercialize product candidates in the United States without first obtaining regulatory approval for the product candidates from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Similarly, we cannot commercialize product candidates outside of the United States without obtaining regulatory approval from similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States, such as the European Medicines Agency in Europe. Even if PNT2258 or another product candidate were to be approved by the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities, any approval might contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for PNT2258 in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval contains significant limitations, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development, marketing or commercialization of PNT2258 or any other product candidate that we may discover, in-license, develop or acquire in the future. Furthermore, even if we obtain regulatory approval for PNT2258, we will still need to develop a commercial organization, or collaborate with a third party for the commercialization of PNT2258, establish commercially viable pricing and obtain approval for coverage and adequate reimbursement from third parties, including government payors. If we are unable to successfully commercialize PNT2258, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to continue our business.\nIn addition, because we are developing other product candidates based on technology substantially similar to the technology on which PNT2258 is based, if PNT2258 encounters safety or efficacy problems, developmental delays or regulatory issues or other problems, our development plans and business may be significantly harmed.\nWe are very early in our development efforts and have only one product candidate in clinical development, which has only been tested in a limited number of patients. If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe are very early in our development efforts and have only one product candidate, PNT2258, in clinical development. PNT2258 has only been tested in a limited number of patients, and the results of completed preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials may not be indicative of the results from future clinical trials with a larger number of enrolled patients. The success of PNT2258 and any future product candidates that we may develop will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022\ncompletion of preclinical studies with positive results;\n\u2022\nsuccessful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials with positive results;\n\u2022\nreceipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nestablishment of commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022\neffective patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity;\n\u2022\nestablishment of a commercial sales team, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022\nacceptance, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022\ncoverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government payors;\n\u2022\nour ability to compete with other therapies;\n\u2022\ncontinued acceptable safety profile following approval;\n\u2022\nenforcement of intellectual property rights and claims;\n\u2022\nachievement of desirable medicinal properties for the intended indications; and\n\u2022\neffective growth of an organization of scientists and business people who can develop and commercialize the products, if approved, and technology.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize PNT2258 or other product candidates that we may develop, which would materially harm our business.\nIf clinical trials of PNT2258 or future product candidates that we may develop fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of PNT2258 or future product candidates.\nIn December 2014, we initiated Wolverine, an open-label 60 patient Phase 2 trial evaluating single-agent PNT2258 for the treatment of third-line relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In October 2015, we initiated Brighton, an open-label 50 patient Phase 2 trial evaluating PNT2258 for the treatment of Richter\u2019s transformed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Richter\u2019s CLL). We may initiate two additional Phase 2 trials, Cypress and Granite, with PNT2258 for the treatment of second-line DLBCL in combination with other treatment regimens, in the \u201ctransplant eligible\u201d and \u201ctransplant ineligible\u201d patient populations, respectively. We may also evaluate PNT2258\u2019s potential in DLBCL in combination with a targeted anti-cancer drug in other\nhematological malignancies. Clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and are uncertain as to outcome. Most product candidates that begin clinical trials are never approved by regulatory authorities for commercialization. We cannot, therefore, guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the required efficacy and safety profile from the performance of any of our clinical programs. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities, including the FDA, for the sale of our product candidates, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans and an acceptable risk/benefit profile. The risk/benefit profile for product approval may include not only the ability to show tumor shrinkage, but also adequate duration of response, a delay in the progression of the disease or an improvement in survival. For example, response rates from the use of our product candidates will likely not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval unless we can also show an adequate duration of response.\nThe outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. To date, we have only obtained results from Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials that are uncontrolled, involve small sample sizes and are of shorter duration than would be required for regulatory approval. Data from these clinical trials and our preclinical studies should not be relied upon as evidence that later or larger-scale, controlled clinical trials will succeed. For example, although the results from our Phase 2 trial of PNT2258 in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL characterized stable disease (SD) as providing evidence of anti-tumor activity, the FDA generally does not consider SD to provide a direct measure of anti-tumor activity. Accordingly, SD will likely not be a component of the primary efficacy endpoint of overall response rate of any pivotal trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval. There may be other reasons why our early clinical trials are not predictive of later clinical trials. For example, we have not discussed the design, including sample size, trial arms, duration and endpoints, or any results, of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials with the FDA, and thus we may not have the benefit of the FDA\u2019s current thinking on trial designs. In addition, the results of clinical trials in one set of patients or line of treatment may not be predictive of those obtained in other clinical trials, and protocols may need to be revised based on unexpected early results.\nMoreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and even if the trials are successfully completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit our product candidates for approval. Many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products. To the extent that the results of our trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, approval of our product candidates may be significantly delayed, or we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards (IRBs) may not authorize us or our investigators to initiate a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\ngovernment or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching or failure to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites and contract research organizations (CROs), or failure by such CROs or trials sites to carry out the clinical trial in accordance with the terms of our agreements with them;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results of clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndecision by us to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\na higher number of patients required for clinical trials, slower than expected enrollment, greater than expected competition for patients or higher than expected drop out rates;\n\u2022\nclinical sites electing to terminate their participation in one of our clinical trials, which would likely have a detrimental effect on subject enrollment;\n\u2022\nfailure of third-party contractors to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of patients or medical investigators to follow our clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\nsuspension or termination of clinical trials for various reasons, including unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold for safety reasons or following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ngreater than expected cost of clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninsufficient supply or quality of product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials;\n\u2022\nundesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of our product candidates, causing us or our investigators, regulators or IRBs to suspend or terminate the trials; and\n\u2022\nrevision of legal or regulatory requirements for approving our product candidates.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain marketing approval in some countries and not in others;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u2022\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or\n\u2022\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nIf the efficacy data obtained in some or all of our PNT2258 clinical trials are highly compelling, we plan to discuss accelerated registration paths and other regulatory designations with regulatory agencies. If we pursue, and ultimately obtain, accelerated approval from FDA for PNT2258 based on a surrogate endpoint, the FDA would require us to conduct a confirmatory trial to verify the predicted clinical benefit and additional safety studies. The results from the confirmatory trial may not support the clinical benefit, which would result in the approval being withdrawn. Moreover, the FDA may withdraw approval of a product approved under the accelerated approval pathway if, for example:\n\u2022\nthe clinical trial or trials required to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product candidate fail to verify such benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug;\n\u2022\nother evidence demonstrates that the product candidate is not shown to be safe or effective under the conditions of use;\n\u2022\nwe fail to conduct any required post-approval trials with due-diligence; or\n\u2022\nwe disseminate false or misleading promotional materials relating to the relevant product or product candidate.\nProduct development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any clinical trials will continue as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, any of which may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to obtain additional capital, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of PNT2258 or any future product candidates.\nWe have used substantial funds to develop our DNAi technology platform and PNT2258. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to further advance PNT2258 in clinical development, scale up manufacturing related to PNT2258, acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies, identify and develop additional product candidates, develop our DNAi technology platform, , seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates, establish a commercial sales force and manufacture and market products, if any, that are approved for commercial sale. We also incur significant additional compliance and administrative costs as a result of operating as a public company. While we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our current operating plans through at least the next 18 months, which we expect will allow us to achieve clinical data read-outs for our Wolverine and Brighton Phase 2 trials, we anticipate that we will need additional funding for the completion of these and our other planned clinical trials.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of our current and planned clinical trials of PNT2258;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of product candidate discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of PNT2258 and any future product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs of future commercialization activities, including drug sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval, to the extent that such sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution are not the responsibility of any collaborator;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or in-license other drugs and technologies;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe success of any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of milestone and royalty payments;\n\u2022\nthe amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our drug candidates receive marketing approval; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims.\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve drug sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived\nfrom sales of PNT2258, if approved, which we do not expect to be commercially available for several years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We have no committed source of additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of PNT2258 or other research and development initiatives. We could be required to seek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to our product candidates in markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization ourselves.\nOur approach to the discovery and development of therapeutic treatments based on our DNAi technology platform is unproven and may not result in marketable products.\nOur approach to the development of therapeutic treatments focuses on using our proprietary DNAi technology platform. This approach is unproven and may not result in marketable products. We plan to leverage our DNAi technology platform to generate a pipeline of product candidates that interfere with oncogenes known to be involved in cancer and potentially genes implicated in other diseases. While we believe that product candidates developed with our DNAi technology platform may offer potential improvements compared to other therapeutic approaches, the scientific research that forms the basis of our efforts to develop product candidates based on our DNAi technology platform is preliminary and limited.\nWe believe we are the first to develop DNAi as a therapeutic modality to be tested in humans. We may discover that our DNAi oligonucleotides do not possess the ability to hybridize to complementary regions of genomic DNA of an oncogenic target or our LNP delivery technology does not possess certain properties required for effective delivery, such as the ability to remain stable in the human body for the period of time required for the drug to reach the cell nucleus. We may spend substantial funds attempting to develop and refine these properties and may never succeed in doing so. In addition, product candidates based on our DNAi technology may demonstrate different chemical and pharmacological properties in patients than they do in laboratory studies. Even if product candidates that target a disease-related gene have successful results in preclinical studies in animals, they may not demonstrate the same chemical and pharmacological properties in humans and may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. As a result, we may never succeed in developing a marketable product, we may not become profitable and the value of our common stock may decline.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nWe may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe number of clinical trials for other product candidates in the same therapeutic area that are currently in clinical development, and our ability to compete with such trials for patients and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u2022\nthe size of the patient population, particularly in Richter\u2019s CLL, which has a very small patient population;\n\u2022\nthe risk that disease progression will result in death before the patient can enroll in clinical trials or before the completion of any clinical trials in which the patient is enrolled;\n\u2022\nthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u2022\nthe design of the trial;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion.\nOur clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates. This competition will reduce the number and types of patients and qualified clinical investigators available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors or clinical trial sites may not allow us to conduct our clinical trial at such site if competing trials are already being conducted there. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial site. We may also encounter difficulties finding a clinical trial site at which to conduct our trials. Moreover, because our product candidates represent a departure from more commonly used methods for cancer treatment, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiation and monoclonal antibodies, rather than enroll patients in any one of our clinical trials.\nDelays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these clinical trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of PNT2258 or any future product candidates we may develop.\nWe intend to form or seek strategic alliances or enter into acquisitions or additional licensing arrangements in the future. We may be unable to form or enter into such alliances, acquisitions or licensing arrangements on our anticipated timeline, and we may not realize the expected benefits of any such transaction.\nWe intend to form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into acquisitions or additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our product candidates and any future product candidates that we may develop. Any of these transactions and relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. These transactions and relationships also may result in a delay in the development of our product candidates if we become dependent upon the other party and such other party does not prioritize the development of our product candidates relative to its other development activities. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates on our anticipated timeline, or all, because our product candidates may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. If we license products or acquire businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction.\nThe manufacture of our DNAi product candidates is complex and we may encounter difficulties in production, particularly with respect to process development or scaling up of our manufacturing capabilities. If our third-party manufacturers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide supply of our product candidates for clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or stopped, or we may be unable to maintain a commercially viable cost structure.\nOur DNAi product candidates comprise formulations of DNAi oligonucleotides encapsulated in LNPs, and the process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly-regulated and subject to many risks. As a result of\nthese complexities, the cost to manufacture oligonucleotides and LNPs, and our DNAi product candidates in particular, is generally higher than traditional small molecule chemical compounds. As product candidates are developed through preclinical to late stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials.\nCurrently, our PNT2258 product candidate is manufactured using an unoptimized process by third-party manufacturers. Although we are working to develop a commercially viable manufacturing process, doing so is a difficult and uncertain task, and there are risks associated with scaling to the level required for advanced clinical trials or commercialization, including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale up, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency and timely availability of reagents or raw materials.\nWe may ultimately be unable to reduce the cost of goods for our product candidates to levels that will allow for an attractive return on investment if and when those product candidates are commercialized. Any of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials, require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidate, impair commercialization efforts, increase our cost of goods and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturing partners may cause our supply of research and development, preclinical and clinical development materials to become limited or interrupted or fail to be of satisfactory quantity or quality.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of PNT2258 and any future potential product candidates that we may develop for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We have engaged third-party manufacturers to obtain lipids, PNT100 and other raw materials and consumables necessary for the manufacture of PNT2258.\nWe may be unable to establish further agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for sufficient quantity and quality;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n\u2022\nfailure to manufacture our product according to our specifications;\n\u2022\nfailure to manufacture our product according to our schedule or at all;\n\u2022\nmisappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us; and\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance, quality assurance and safety reporting.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States, which are FDA requirements for ensuring product quality control. Our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, although we are not involved in the day-to-day operations of our contract manufacturers, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our products and\nproduct candidates are manufactured in accordance with cGMPs. Therefore, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, quality control and quality assurance. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or approved products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our medicines and harm our business and results of operations.\nAny performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers, or any interruption or poor yield or quality of manufactured materials, could delay clinical development or marketing approval. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. If any one of our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace that manufacturer. Although we believe that there are several potential alternative manufacturers who could manufacture our product candidates, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement.\nIf our third-party manufacturers use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials, by our third-party manufacturers. Our manufacturers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of medical and hazardous materials. Although we believe that our manufacturers\u2019 procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from medical or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. We do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from medical or hazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nThus, our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or medicines may adversely affect our clinical development timeline, our future profit margins or our ability to commercialize any product candidates that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could halt their clinical development, prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences.\nWe have conducted two clinical trials with PNT2258 to date: a Phase 1 safety trial in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors and a pilot Phase 2 trial in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL). PNT2258 was considered to be well tolerated by the investigators in these trials, with most adverse events (AEs) of mild to moderate designation. However, we have not discussed with the FDA, and the FDA may not agree with, our current or any future assessment of the side-effect or safety profile of PNT2258 in these or other indications. In addition, because PNT2258 has been tested as monotherapy in relatively small patient populations and for limited durations to date, additional side effects may be observed as its development progresses, including in any combination trials that we may conduct in the future. Furthermore, given that some of the patients in our clinical trials may continue therapy until disease progression, we may observe additional side effects with extended dosing, and it may be difficult to distinguish such AEs from symptoms of disease progression. Given the similar chemistries underlying PNT2258 and our other potential DNAi product candidates, it is possible their observed safety profiles may be similar.\nUndesirable side effects caused by any of our product candidates could cause us, IRBs, our CROs, the FDA or other regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or discontinue clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications. This, in turn, could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and generating revenues from their sale. In addition, if any of our products cause serious or unexpected side effects or are associated with other safety risks after receiving marketing approval, a number of potential significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of this product;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to recall the product, change the way it is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u2022\nthe product may be rendered less competitive and sales may decrease;\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer generally both among clinicians and patients;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require certain labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications or limitations on the indications for use, or impose restrictions on distribution in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) in connection with approval, if any; or\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials.\nWe may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants or if preliminary data demonstrate that our product candidates are unlikely to receive regulatory approval or unlikely to be successfully commercialized.\nAny one or a combination of these events could prevent us from obtaining approval and achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of the product.\nThe market may not be receptive to PNT2258 or any future product candidates that we may develop, which are based on a novel therapeutic modality, and we may not generate any future revenue from the sale or licensing of product candidates.\nEven if approval is obtained for a product candidate, we may not generate or sustain revenue from sales of the product due to factors such as whether the product can be sold at a competitive cost and otherwise accepted in the market. PNT2258 is based on new technologies and unproven therapeutic approaches. Market participants with significant influence over acceptance of new treatments, such as physicians and third-party payors, may not adopt a treatment based on DNAi technology, and we may not be able to convince the medical community and third-party payors to accept and use, or to provide favorable reimbursement for, PNT2258 or any future product candidates developed by us. Market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, will depend on, among other factors:\n\u2022\nthe timing of our receipt of any marketing and commercialization approvals;\n\u2022\nthe terms of any approvals and the countries in which approvals are obtained;\n\u2022\nthe safety and efficacy of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects associated with our product candidates;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in any labeling approved by the FDA or other regulatory authority;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe success of our physician education programs;\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate government and third-party payor coverage and reimbursement;\n\u2022\nthe pricing of our products, particularly as compared to alternative treatments; and\n\u2022\navailability of alternative effective treatments for the disease indications our product candidates are intended to treat and the relative risks, benefits and costs of those treatments.\nWith our focus on emerging DNAi technology, these risks may increase to the extent the space becomes more competitive or less favored in the commercial marketplace.\nAdditional risks apply in relation to any disease indications we pursue that are classified as rare diseases and that may allow for orphan drug designation by regulatory agencies in major commercial markets. For example, we are developing PNT2258 for the treatment of DLBCL, an aggressive form of NHL, for which we may seek orphan drug designation from the FDA. Because of the small patient population for a rare disease, if pricing is not approved or accepted in the market at an appropriate level for an approved product with orphan drug designation, such drug may not generate enough revenue to offset costs of development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization despite any benefits received from the orphan drug designation, such as market exclusivity, assistance in clinical trial design or a reduction in user fees or tax credits related to development expense.\nBecause our product candidates are based on new technology, we expect that they will require extensive research and development and have substantial manufacturing and processing costs. In addition, costs to treat patients with DLBCL and Richter\u2019s CLL can be significant. Accordingly, our clinical trial costs are likely to be significantly higher than for more conventional therapeutic technologies or products. In addition, our proposed product candidates involve several complex and costly manufacturing and processing steps, the costs of which will be borne by us.\nMarket size is also a variable in disease indications not classified as rare. Our estimates regarding potential market size for any indication may be materially different from what we discover to exist at the time we commence commercialization, if any, for a product, which could result in significant changes in our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe rely and will rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe depend and will depend upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities, medical institutions, CROs and strategic partners to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials under agreements with us. We expect to have to negotiate budgets and contracts with CROs and trial sites, which may result in delays to our development timelines and increased costs. We will rely heavily on these third parties over the course of our clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third parties are required to comply with current good clinical practices (cGCPs), which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable cGCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the cGCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with drug product produced under cGMPs. Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which\nwould delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws.\nAny third parties conducting our clinical trials will not be our employees and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical, clinical and nonclinical programs. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nWe may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate our clinical trials if they are not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the results are negative or inconclusive or the trials are not well designed.\nRegulatory agencies, IRBs or data safety monitoring boards may at any time recommend the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCPs, or other applicable foreign government guidelines. Clinical trials are subject to oversight by the FDA, other foreign governmental agencies and IRBs at the study sites where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced in accordance with applicable cGMPs. Clinical trials may be suspended by the FDA, other foreign governmental agencies, or us for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trials, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the clinical trial operations or trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate may have unforeseen adverse side effects;\n\u2022\ndeficiencies in the trial design necessary to demonstrate efficacy;\n\u2022\nfatalities or other AEs arising during a clinical trial due to medical problems that may not be related to clinical trial treatments;\n\u2022\nthe product candidate may not appear to be more effective than current therapies; or\n\u2022\nthe quality or stability of the product candidate may fall below acceptable standards.\nAlthough we have never been asked by a regulatory agency, IRB or data safety monitoring board to temporarily or permanently discontinue a clinical trial, if we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate a clinical trial of any other of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for that product will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from that product may be delayed or eliminated. Furthermore, any of these events could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates and impair our ability to generate revenue from the commercialization of these products either by us or by our collaboration partners.\nWe face significant competition from other oncology companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe oncology industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.\nIf PNT2258 is approved for DLBCL or Richter\u2019s CLL, as the case may be, it will compete with existing therapies and currently marketed drugs, including the following:\n\u2022\nDLBCL. Therapy for DLBCL typically consists of multi-agent cytotoxic drugs in combination with the monoclonal antibody rituximab. In patients with DLBCL who are not elderly and who have good organ function, high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation is often used. Newer targeted agents such as the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide have shown activity in the ABC subtype of DLBCL. There are also a number of other widely used anti-cancer agents that have broad labels that include NHL, and some of these are being evaluated alone or in combination for the treatment of patients with DLBCL that have relapsed after several different types of chemotherapy. Certain monoclonal antibodies similar to rituximab are also being evaluated in relapsed DLBCL. Other oncology companies that have developed or are currently developing treatment for patients with DLBCL include Abbvie Inc., Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Celgene Corporation, Epizyme, Inc., Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Kite Pharma, Inc., Novartis AG and Pharmacyclics, Inc.\n\u2022\nRichter\u2019s CLL. Although there are no specific therapies approved to treat Richter\u2019s CLL, multi-agent cytotoxic drugs in combination with rituximab is typically used as a first-line treatment. To our knowledge, Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. is the only other company with an active trial focused specifically on Richter\u2019s CLL.\nMany of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial and other resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the oncology industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs. If we fail to complete effectively, our business and operating results would be harmed.\nWe currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience in marketing products. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities and have no experience in marketing products. If one of our product candidates is approved for sale, we intend to develop an in-house marketing organization\nand sales force, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time. We will have to compete with other oncology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel.\nIf we are unable or decide not to establish internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we will pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if we are able to do so, that they will have effective sales forces. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to commercialize any product in the United States or overseas.\nWe have requested orphan drug designation for the use of PNT2258 to treat DLBCL, Richter\u2019s CLL and other rare indications. We may be unable to obtain such designations or to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug status, including market exclusivity, which may cause our revenue, if any, to be reduced.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a new drug application (NDA) and entitles the sponsor to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.\nIf a product candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including an NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. As a result, even if one of our drug candidates receives orphan exclusivity, the FDA can still approve other drugs that have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same indication or disease. Furthermore, the FDA can waive orphan exclusivity if we are unable to manufacture sufficient supply of our product.\nWe have requested orphan drug designation for the use of PNT2258 to treat DLBCL, Richter\u2019s CLL or other rare indications. We have obtained EU orphan drug designation and have submitted a U.S. orphan drug designation request however, despite such request, we may not obtain orphan drug designation for any indications in the United States. Even if we obtain orphan drug designation, we will not obtain exclusive marketing rights in the United States if we are not the first sponsor to obtain approval for the candidate for the orphan designated indication. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited or lost if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan designated indication, if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective, if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition, or if a second product containing the same active moiety for the same orphan condition is demonstrated to be clinically superior to our product.\nA fast track designation by the FDA may not lead to faster development, regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may seek fast track designation for some applications of PNT2258. If a product candidate is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the product candidate sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it. Even if we do receive fast track designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures, and receipt of fast track designation does not assure ultimate marketing approval from the FDA. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nA breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for any application of PNT2258 may not lead to faster development, regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that PNT2258 will receive marketing approval.\nWe may seek a breakthrough therapy designation for some applications of PNT2258. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For product candidates that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor may help identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective or less effective control regimens. Product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for accelerated approval if the relevant criteria are met.\nDesignation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe an application of PNT2258 meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures, and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if PNT2258 qualifies as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may later decide that it no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nWe may be unable to identify the regulatory regions of other cancer and disease-related genes and may not develop additional product candidates.\nOne of our strategies is to leverage our DNAi technology platform to generate a pipeline of product candidates that interefere with oncogenes known to be involved in cancer and potentially genes implicated in other diseases. We may be unable to identify the regulatory regions of other cancer and disease genes, and if we do, we may be unsuccessful in developing a product candidate that inhibits transcription or effectively provides therapeutic treatment. Even if our research programs initially show promise in targeting other genes and identifying potential product candidates, they may ultimately fail to yield product candidates for clinical development. Developing, obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing additional product candidates will require substantial additional funding and is prone to the risks of failure inherent in the development of therapeutic treatments. We cannot provide you any assurance that we will be able to successfully advance any potential future product candidates through the development process.\nWe are dependent on our key personnel, and if we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive oncology industry depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are dependent on our management, scientific and medical personnel, including Nick Glover, Ph.D., our President and Chief Executive Officer, Angie You, Ph.D., our Chief Business and Strategy Officer and Head of Commercial, Barbara Klencke, M.D., our Chief Development Officer, and Sukhi Jagpal, our Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, other key employees and other scientific and medical advisors, and our inability to find suitable replacements, could result in delays in product development and harm our business.\nWe conduct a portion of our operations in Vancouver, British Columbia. Many other oncology companies and many academic and research institutions have located their headquarters in this region. Competition for skilled personnel in our market is intense and may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all.\nTo induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. Although we have employment agreements with our key employees, these employment agreements provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 52 employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, and as we continue to develop our public company infrastructure, we expect to need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other personnel. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining and motivating additional employees;\n\u2022\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical, FDA and international regulatory review process for our product candidates, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties; and\n\u2022\nimproving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth, and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities.\nWe currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain independent organizations, advisors and consultants to provide certain services, including substantially all aspects of regulatory approval, clinical management and manufacturing. There can be no assurance that the services of independent organizations, advisors and consultants will continue to be available to us on a timely basis when needed, or that we can find qualified replacements. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates or otherwise advance our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding our groups of consultants and contractors, we may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize our product candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us.\nOur internal computer systems, or those used by our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access. While we have not experienced any such material system failure or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on other third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations, and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants, could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce and process our product candidates. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of our product candidates could be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. Our corporate headquarters are in Vancouver, British Columbia near major earthquake faults. Our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other illegal activity by our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors. Misconduct by such individuals could include intentional failures to comply with FDA or international regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA or other international regulatory bodies, comply with manufacturing standards, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data timely, completely and accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by third parties could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials.\nWe have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent inappropriate conduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any of our product candidates outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.\nA variety of risks associated with marketing PNT2258 internationally could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe plan to seek regulatory approval of PNT2258 outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\ndiffering payor reimbursement regimes, governmental payors or patient self-pay systems and price controls;\n\u2022\npotential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u2022\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if our product candidates cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any product candidate; and\n\u2022\na decline in our stock price.\nWe currently hold clinical trial liability insurance coverage, but that coverage may not be adequate to cover any and all liabilities that we may incur. We would need to increase our insurance coverage when we begin the commercialization of our product candidates, if ever. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had U.S. federal operating loss carryforwards of $57.0 million and state operating loss carryforwards of $54.5 million, expiring in years ranging from 2021 to 2035. We also had net tax credit carryforwards of $1.9 million available to reduce future tax liabilities, if any, for U.S. federal purposes. The net tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2031. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5% stockholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We have experienced an ownership change in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or other pre-change tax attributes, to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income and taxes may be subject to limitations.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock price.\nGlobal credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions in the past several years, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. We cannot assure you that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our general business strategy and stock price may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon clinical development plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive these difficult economic times, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expense related to PNT2258 or future development programs;\n\u2022\nresults of preclinical and clinical trials, or the addition or termination of clinical trials or funding support;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the release of results from any clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of milestone and royalty payments to our licensor;\n\u2022\nour execution of any new collaboration, licensing or similar arrangement, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under such existing or future arrangements or the termination or modification of any such existing or future arrangements;\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit or opposition, interference or cancellation proceeding in which we may become involved;\n\u2022\nadditions and departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nstrategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u2022\nif any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, market acceptance and demand for such product candidates;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments affecting our product candidates or those of our competitors; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general market and economic conditions.\nIf our quarterly operating results or expected results from clinical trials fall outside the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nWe may be unable to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approval of PNT2258, and, as a result, we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates.\nOur lead product candidate, PNT2258, is, and any future product candidates that we may develop will be, subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research, testing, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, import, export, reporting, labeling, storage, packaging, advertising and promotion, pricing, marketing, distribution, import and export of drugs. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required to be successfully completed before a new drug can be marketed in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. It is possible that none of the product candidates we may develop will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us or our collaborators to begin selling them.\nWe have very limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA and, as a company, we have no experience in obtaining approval of any product candidates. The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the initiation of clinical trials, depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. We may encounter delays or rejections during any stage of the regulatory review and approval process based upon the failure of clinical or laboratory data to demonstrate compliance with, or upon the failure of the product candidates to meet, the FDA\u2019s requirements for safety, efficacy and quality.\nThe standards that the FDA and its foreign counterparts use when regulating us are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Because the drugs we are developing may represent a new class of drug, the FDA and its foreign counterparts have not yet established any definitive policies, practices or guidelines in relation to these drugs. The lack of policies, practices or guidelines may hinder or slow review by the FDA of any regulatory filings that we may submit. Moreover, the FDA may respond to these submissions by defining requirements we may not have anticipated. Such responses could lead to significant delays in the clinical development of our product candidates.\nAny analysis we perform of data from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, for example, from future legislation or administrative action, or from changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA or foreign regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nIn addition, the FDA may delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndisagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety or efficacy required by the FDA for approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may find deficiencies in our manufacturing processes or facilities; and\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s approval policies or regulations may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nWe plan to pursue a broad registration-oriented clinical development program, initially in hematologic malignancies, that we anticipate will provide the foundation of a global registration strategy for PNT2258. We have not, however, discussed the design of the Wolverine or Brighton clinical trials with the FDA and, thus, cannot assure you that the FDA will consider their design or results adequate for these purposes.\nAfter submission of a NDA, the FDA may refuse to file the application, deny approval of the application, require additional testing or data or, if the NDA is filed and later approved, require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. The FDA\u2019s timelines are flexible and subject to change based on workload and other potential review issues and may delay the FDA\u2019s review of an NDA. Further, the terms of approval of any NDA, including the product labeling, may be more restrictive than we desire and could affect the marketability of our products.\nEven if we comply with all of the FDA regulatory requirements, we may not obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates in development. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates in development, we will have fewer commercialized products than we anticipate and correspondingly lower revenue.\nIn addition, because there may be approved treatments for some of the diseases for which we may seek approval, in order to receive regulatory approval, we may need to demonstrate through clinical trials that the product candidates we develop to treat these diseases, if any, are not only safe and effective, but safer or more effective than existing products. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been increased public and political pressure on the FDA with respect to the approval process for new drugs, and the FDA\u2019s standards, especially regarding drug safety, appear to have become more stringent.\nAny delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from the particular product candidate for which we are seeking approval. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the approved uses for which we may market the product or the labeling or other restrictions. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a REMS plan as part of or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved product, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry. These limitations and restrictions may limit the size of the market for the product and affect reimbursement by third-party payors.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process varies among countries and may include all of the risks associated with FDA approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States and vice versa.\nIf we or any collaborators, manufacturers or service providers fail to comply with applicable federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, which could affect our ability to develop, market and sell our products successfully and could harm our reputation and lead to reduced acceptance of our products by the market. These enforcement actions include, among others:\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory inspection findings;\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls or public notification or medical product safety alerts to healthcare professionals;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on, or prohibitions against, marketing our products;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on, or prohibitions against, importation or exportation of our products;\n\u2022\nsuspension of review or refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u2022\nexclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nexclusion from eligibility for the award of government contracts for our products;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of product approvals;\n\u2022\nproduct seizures;\n\u2022\ninjunctions; and\n\u2022\ncivil and criminal penalties and fines.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval of PNT2258, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates.\nAny regulatory approvals that we receive for PNT2258 will require surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate, and may require us to conduct post-approval clinical studies. The FDA may also require a REMS in order to approve our product candidates, which could entail requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, AE reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for our product candidates will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs and cGCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval.\nMoreover, if we obtain regulatory approval for PNT2258 or any other product candidate, we will only be permitted to market our products for the indication approved by FDA, and such approval may involve limitations on the indicated uses or promotional claims we may make for our products, or otherwise not permit labeling that\nsufficiently differentiates our product candidates from competitive products with comparable therapeutic profiles. For example, we will not be able to claim that our products have fewer side effects, or improve compliance or efficacy unless we can demonstrate those attributes to FDA in comparative clinical trials.\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with our product candidates, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our product candidates, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022\nfines, warning letters, or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nholds on clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of license approvals;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates; and\n\u2022\ninjunctions, the imposition of civil penalties or criminal prosecution.\nThe FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nIn addition, if we pursue, and ultimately obtain, accelerated approval of PNT2258 based on a surrogate endpoint, the FDA would require us to conduct a confirmatory trial to verify the predicted clinical benefit and additional safety studies. The results from the confirmatory trial may not support the clinical benefit, which would result in the approval being withdrawn.\nIf we or any of our independent contractors, consultants, collaborators, manufacturers, vendors or service providers fail to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, we or they could be subject to enforcement actions, which could result in penalties and affect our ability to develop, market and sell our product candidates and may harm our reputation.\nWe are or may in the future be subject to federal, state, and foreign healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights. These laws and regulations include:\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for a healthcare item or service, or the purchasing or ordering of an item or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, claims for payment by government funded programs such as Medicare or Medicaid that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to us by virtue of statements and representations made to customers or third parties;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), which imposes requirements on certain types of people and entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and requires notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members, which is published in a searchable form on an annual basis; and\n\u2022\nstate laws comparable to each of the above federal laws, such as, for example, anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and also apply to commercial insurers and other non-federal payors, requirements for mandatory corporate regulatory compliance programs, and laws relating to patient data privacy and security. Other state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any such health care laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, or exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could adversely our financial results. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources.\nAny products we develop may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, thereby harming our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. Although we intend to monitor these regulations, our programs are currently in the early stages of development and we will not be able to assess the impact of price regulations for a number of years. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. Even if we succeed in bringing one or more products to the market, these products may not be considered cost-effective, and the amount\nreimbursed for any products may be insufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Because our programs are in the early stages of development, we are unable at this time to determine their cost effectiveness or the likely level or method of reimbursement. Increasingly, the third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans, who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices, and are seeking to reduce the prices charged or the amounts reimbursed for pharmaceutical products. If the coverage provided for any products we develop is inadequate in light of our development and other costs, our return on investment could be adversely affected.\nCertain products we develop may need to be administered under the supervision of a physician on an outpatient basis. Under applicable U.S. law, certain drugs that are not usually self-administered (including certain injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under the Medicare Part B program if:\n\u2022\nthey are incident to a physician\u2019s services;\n\u2022\nthey are reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the illness or injury for which they are administered according to accepted standards of medical practice; and\n\u2022\nthey have been approved by the FDA and meet other requirements of the statute.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage for newly-approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA. Moreover, eligibility for coverage does not imply that any drug will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim payments for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent.\nReimbursement may be based on payments allowed for lower-cost products that are already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other services and may reflect budgetary constraints or imperfections in Medicare data. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. However, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for new drugs that we develop and for which we obtain regulatory approval could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our financial condition.\nWe believe that the efforts of governments and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare and legislative and regulatory proposals to broaden the availability of healthcare will continue to affect the business and financial condition of oncology companies. A number of legislative and regulatory changes in the healthcare system in the United States and other major healthcare markets have been proposed in recent years, and such efforts have expanded substantially in recent years. These developments have included prescription drug benefit legislation that was enacted and took effect in January 2006, healthcare reform legislation enacted by certain states, and major healthcare reform legislation that was passed by Congress and enacted into law in the United States in 2010. These developments could, directly or indirectly, affect our ability to sell our products, if approved, at a favorable price.\nFor example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (PPACA), contains provisions that affect companies in the pharmaceutical industry\nand other healthcare related industries by imposing additional costs and changes to business practices. Provisions affecting pharmaceutical companies include the following.\n\u2022\nmandatory rebates for drugs sold into the Medicaid program were increased, and the rebate requirement was extended to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans;\n\u2022\nthe 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Services Act was extended to require mandatory discounts for drug products sold to certain critical access hospitals, cancer hospitals and other covered entities;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nexpansion of entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022\na new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;\n\u2022\npharmaceutical companies are required to offer discounts on brand-name drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d; and\n\u2022\npharmaceutical companies are required to pay an annual non-tax deductible fee to the federal government based on each company\u2019s market share of prior year total sales of branded products to certain federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense. Since we expect our branded pharmaceutical sales, if any of our products are approved, to constitute a small portion of the total federal health program pharmaceutical market, we do not expect this annual assessment to have a material impact on our financial condition.\nThere have been judicial and Congressional challenges, and amendments to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future. The full effect of the U.S. healthcare reform legislation on our business activities is unknown. The financial impact of the U.S. healthcare reform legislation will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to, the policies reflected in implementing regulations and guidance and changes in sales volumes for products affected by the new system of rebates, discounts and fees. The legislation may also have a positive impact on our future net sales, if any, by increasing the aggregate number of persons with healthcare coverage in the United States. Further, new litigation is currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court to invalidate certain provisions of the PPACA.\nMoreover, we cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal and state legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives in the United States to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.\nOur ability to obtain services, reimbursement or funding from the federal government may be impacted by possible reductions in federal spending.\nU.S. federal government agencies currently face potentially significant spending reductions. Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, the failure of Congress to enact deficit reduction measures of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggered automatic cuts to most federal programs. These cuts would include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to two percent per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was enacted on January 1, 2013, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers. The full impact on our business of these automatic cuts is uncertain. If federal spending is reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may\nalso impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve drug research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for PNT2258 in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval for PNT2258, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials as clinical studies conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval.\nWe may also submit marketing applications in other countries. Regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside of the United States have requirements for approval of product candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those jurisdictions. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets or receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials, by ourselves and our third-party manufacturers. Our manufacturers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States and abroad governing laboratory procedures and the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of medical and hazardous materials. Although we believe that our manufacturers\u2019 procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from medical or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. We do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from medical or hazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe depend on intellectual property licensed from Marina, and the termination of this license could result in the loss of significant rights, which would harm our business.\nPursuant to a license agreement with Marina, we hold an exclusive license from Marina to use certain patented delivery technology, including a particular form of liposomal delivery system, for unlimited use with our current or future DNAi products candidates directed against any gene target. Either party may terminate this license agreement in the event of a material breach that remains uncured following the date that is up to 120 days, depending on the type of breach, from the date that the breaching party is provided with written notice by the non-breaching party, or immediately upon certain insolvency events relating to the other party. See \u201cItem 1, Business-License and Payment Agreements\u201d for additional information regarding this license agreement.\nDisputes may arise between us and Marina regarding intellectual property subject to this license agreement, including with respect to:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nwhether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of milestone and royalty payments;\n\u2022\nthe rights of Marina under the license agreement;\n\u2022\nour right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties under collaborative development relationships;\n\u2022\nour diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our product candidates, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; and\n\u2022\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by Marina and us and our partners.\nAny disputes with Marina over intellectual property that we have licensed from it may prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangement. We depend on these licensed technologies and products to develop PNT2258 and other product candidates developed from our DNAi technology platform. Termination of our license agreement could result in the loss of significant rights and could materially harm our ability to further develop and commercialize PNT2258 and any other product candidates. Additionally, our license extends to a particular form of liposomal delivery system for a product candidate that incorporates one of our DNAi oligonucleotides, and it does not prevent Marina from licensing a different form of liposomal delivery system to a different company, which it has done in the past and may continue to do in the future. If Marina licensed a form of liposomal delivery system to an oncology company developing DNAi technology, we would face increased competition.\nAdditionally, our success will depend in part on the ability of Marina to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights. Marina may not successfully prosecute the patent applications licensed to us. Even if patents issue or are granted, Marina may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, or may pursue litigation less aggressively than we would.\nIf we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our technologies or product candidates, development and commercialization of our product candidates may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other forms of intellectual property rights, including in-licenses of intellectual property rights of others, for our product candidates, methods used to manufacture our product candidates and methods for treating patients using our product candidates, as well as our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We have filed and will continue to file patent applications directed to the compositions of matter and methods of use related to various aspects of PNT2258 and our DNAi technology. As of December 31, 2015, we were the owner of seven U.S. patents, expiring between 2017 and 2028, absent any adjustments or extensions, comprising claims directed to the compositions of PNT2258, PNT100, oligonucleotides directed against the oncogenes CMYC and RAS, and methods of use of pharmaceutical compositions comprising PNT2258 and rituximab. As of December 31, 2015, we also owned five pending U.S. patent applications, related to PNT2258 for the treatment of cancer indications as a single agent, or in combination with chemotherapeutics and/or rituximab and DNA oligonucleotides directed against various oncogenes, including RAS. Any patents issuing from these U.S. utility applications are expected to expire between 2024 and 2034, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2015, we also owned 39 issued foreign patents and 26 pending foreign patent applications in 23 foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Europe and Japan. These foreign patents, and any patents issuing from these pending foreign patent applications, are expected to expire between 2025 and 2034, absent any adjustments or extensions. These foreign patents and patent applications comprise claims that relate to the compositions of PNT2258, PNT100, oligonucleotides directed against the oncogenes CMYC, CHARAS, CKIRAS, HER2 and TGFBeta and methods of use of PNT2258 for cancer indications as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapeutics and/or rituximab.\nWe and our current or future licensors and licenses may not be able to apply for or prosecute patents on certain aspects of our product candidates or delivery technologies at a reasonable cost in a timely fashion or at all. It is also possible that we or our current licensors, or any future licensors or licensees, will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Therefore, our patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope or patent term adjustments. If our current licensors, or any future licensors or licensees, are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised and we might not be able to prevent third parties from making, using, and selling competing products. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid and unenforceable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods, and know-how. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThere is no guarantee that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued or granted patents, that any of our issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid or unenforceable or that any issued or granted patents will include claims that are sufficiently broad to cover our product candidates or delivery technologies or to provide meaningful protection from our competitors. Moreover, the patent position of oncology companies can be highly uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our current and future proprietary technology and product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. If third parties disclose or misappropriate our proprietary rights, it may materially and adversely impact our position in the market.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent\nprocess. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case. The standards applied by the USPTO and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in oncology patents. Moreover, changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection that we will have on our proprietary products and technology. While we will endeavor to try to protect our product candidates with intellectual property rights such as patents, as appropriate, the process of obtaining patents is time-consuming, expensive and sometimes unpredictable.\nFurther, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed (or 20 years after the filing date of the first non-provisional US patent application to which it claims priority). Various extensions may be available; however the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for our product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of our product candidates. Further, the extensive period of time between patent filing and regulatory approval for a product candidate limits the time during which we can market a product candidate under patent protection, which may particularly affect the profitability of our early-stage product candidates.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, in particular with respect to our DNAi technology platform, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection for certain aspects of our product candidates and delivery technologies, we also consider trade secrets, including confidential and unpatented know-how important to the maintenance of our competitive position. With respect to our DNAi technology platform, we consider trade secrets and know-how to be our primary intellectual property. We protect trade secrets and confidential and unpatented know-how, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to such knowledge, such as our employees, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to maintain confidentiality and assign their inventions to us.\nDespite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Additionally, we anticipate that with respect to our DNAi technology platform, these trade secrets and know-how may over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology and the movement of personnel skilled in the art from academic to industry scientific positions. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nNumerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the USPTO may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) enacted in 2011 involves significant changes in patent legislation. An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more\npatent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application.\nFurther, the Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, some of which cases either narrow the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weaken the rights of patent owners in certain situations. These changes have led to increasing uncertainty with regard to the scope and value of our issued patents and to our ability to obtain patents in the future.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.\nDepending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. federal courts, the USPTO or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that may weaken our and our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents we and our licensors or partners may obtain in the future.\nRecent court cases such as Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. (Myriad); BRCA1- & BRCA2-Based Hereditary Cancer Test Patent Litig.; and Promega Corp. v. Life Technologies Corp. have added to the uncertainty surrounding patent claims directed to nucleic acid products and pharmaceutical compositions comprising such products. For example, the recent decision by the Supreme Court in Myriad precludes a claim to a nucleic acid having a stated nucleotide sequence which is identical to a sequence found in nature and unmodified. We are currently uncertain as to what, if any, immediate impact this decision may have on our patents or patent applications because the extent to which the Myriad decision impacts the validity of claims directed to pharmaceutical formulations that include unmodified nucleic acid molecules having sequences identical to those found in genomic DNA has yet to be clearly interpreted by courts and by the USPTO. We cannot assure you that the interpretations of this decision or subsequent rulings will not adversely impact our patents or patent applications. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nOnce granted, patents may remain open to opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification derivation and opposition proceedings in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings for a given period after allowance or grant, during which time third parties can raise objections against such initial grant. In the course of such proceedings, which may continue for a protracted period of time, the patent owner may be compelled to limit the scope of the allowed or granted claims thus attacked, or may lose the allowed or granted claims altogether.\nWe, our licensors or any future strategic partners may become subject to third-party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or other proprietary rights or seeking to invalidate patents or other proprietary rights.\nWe, our licensors or any future strategic partners may be subject to third-party claims for infringement or misappropriation of patent or other proprietary rights. If we, our licensors or any future strategic partners are\nfound to infringe a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed. In addition, we, our licensors or any future strategic partners may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from a third party, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license, we may be unable to effectively market product candidates based on our technology, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations. Alternatively, we may need to redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In addition, we may find it necessary to pursue claims or initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights. The cost to us in defending or initiating any litigation or other proceeding relating to patent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management\u2019s attention. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our products or our technology, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or certain aspects of our platform technology. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without legally infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could result in a loss of our current patent rights and could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation or interference proceedings may result in a decision adverse to our interests and, even if we are successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with\nour licensors, misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nOther companies or organizations may challenge our or our licensors\u2019 patent rights or may assert patent rights that prevent us from developing and commercializing our products.\nDNAi technology is a new scientific field. We have obtained grants and issuances of DNAi patents. The issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in key markets around the world that we own or license claim many different methods, compositions and processes relating to the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of DNAi technology.\nAs the field of DNAi technology matures, patent applications are being processed by national patent offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which patents will issue, and, if they do, as to when, to whom, and with what claims. It is likely that there will be significant litigation in the courts and other proceedings, such as interference, reexamination, post-grant review, inter partes review, derivation and opposition proceedings, in various patent offices relating to patent rights in the DNAi technology field. In many cases, the possibility of appeal or opposition exists for either us or our opponents, and it may be years before final, unappealable rulings are made with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions. The timing and outcome of these and other proceedings is uncertain and may adversely affect our business if we are not successful in defending the patentability and scope of our pending and issued patent claims or if third parties are successful in obtaining claims that cover our DNAi technology platform or any of our product candidates. In addition, third parties may attempt to invalidate our intellectual property rights. Even if our rights are not directly challenged, disputes could lead to the weakening of our intellectual property rights. Our defense against any attempt by third parties to circumvent or invalidate our intellectual property rights could be costly to us, could require significant time and attention of our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to successfully compete in the field of DNAi technology.\nWe have limited foreign intellectual property rights and may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nWe have limited intellectual property rights outside the United States. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to oncology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration or other agreements, we may be required to pay damages and could lose intellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and protecting our product candidates and delivery technologies or we could lose certain rights to grant sublicenses.\nOur current license imposes, and any future licenses we enter into are likely to impose, various development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement, and other obligations on us. For example, we are required to pay Novosom a $3.0 million milestone payment upon regulatory approval of PNT2258 and low single-digit royalties on net sales of PNT2258, and we are required to pay Marina milestone payments of up to $14.5 million and low single-digit royalties on net sales of any DNAi product candidates other than PNT2258. If we breach any of these obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell products that are covered by the licensed technology or enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor\u2019s rights. In addition, we may be required to pay significant milestone and royalty payments, depending on the technology and intellectual property we use in products that we successfully develop and commercialize, if any. Therefore, even if we successfully develop and commercialize products, we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf our trademarks are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have trademarked ProNAi and DNAi. Our trademarks may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks or may be forced to stop using these names, which we need for name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other oncology companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nthe commencement, enrollment or results of the planned clinical trials of our product candidates or any future clinical trials we may conduct, or changes in the development status of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nany delay in our regulatory filings for our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority\u2019s review of such filings;\n\u2022\ndisputes with Marina regarding our licensed technology and products;\n\u2022\nadverse results or delays in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u2022\nadverse developments concerning our manufacturers;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nour inability to establish collaborations if needed;\n\u2022\nour failure to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u2022\nthe size and growth of our initial cancer target markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully treat additional types of cancers or at different stages;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry, or immunotherapy in particular, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and oncology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and may not use them effectively.\nWe have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from our initial public offering, including for any of the purposes described in the prospectus related to our initial public offering. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the remaining net proceeds, their ultimate use may vary substantially from the use described in the prospectus related to our initial public offering. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could harm our business.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) enacted in April 2012. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 (Section 404) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which requires the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates to exceed $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result, changes in rules of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation, the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the stock exchange upon which our common stock is listed and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. However, these rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nWe are not currently required to comply with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that implement Section 404, and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose until our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2016. Pursuant to Section 404, we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed timeframe or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404.\nAdditionally, we have in the past and may in the future identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or personnel, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.
