{"cik": "807882", "company": "JACK IN THE BOX INC /NEW/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-11-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nWe caution you that our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors listed below are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from projections in the forward-looking statements contained in this report, in our other filings with the SEC, in our news releases and in oral statements by our representatives. However, other factors that we do not anticipate or that we do not consider significant based on currently available information may also have an adverse effect on our results.\nRisks Related to the Food Service Industry. Food service businesses such as ours may be materially and adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences, national and regional economic, political and socioeconomic conditions, attitudes and changes in consumer dining habits (whether or not based on new information regarding diet, nutrition or health), as well as by the cost of food at home compared to food away from home, technological and other innovations, health-based regulations or other factors. Adverse economic conditions, such as higher levels of unemployment, lower levels of consumer confidence and decreased discretionary spending, may reduce restaurant traffic and sales and impose practical limits on pricing. If adverse or uncertain economic conditions persist for an extended period of time, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their spending behavior. The impact of these factors may be exacerbated by the geographic profile of our Jack in the Box brand. Specifically, nearly 70% of the restaurants in our Jack in the Box system are located in the states of California and Texas. Economic conditions, state and local laws, government regulations, weather conditions or natural disasters affecting those states may therefore more greatly impact our results than would similar occurrences in other locations.\nThe performance of our business may also be adversely affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nseasonal sales fluctuations;\n\u2022\nsevere weather and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nunfavorable trends or developments concerning operating costs such as inflation, increased costs of food, fuel, utilities, technology, labor (including due to minimum wage increases or new administrative interpretations of regulations impacting labor costs), insurance, or employee benefits (including healthcare, workers\u2019 compensation and other insurance costs and premiums);\n\u2022\nthe impact of initiatives by competitors and increased competition generally;\n\u2022\nlack of customer acceptance of new menu items, service initiatives or potential price increases necessary to cover higher input costs;\n\u2022\ncustomers trading down to lower priced items and/or shifting to competitive offerings with lower priced products;\n\u2022\nlabor disruptions, unionization, labor shortages or other labor or employee relations issues, and the availability of qualified, experienced management and hourly employees at company and franchise locations; and\n\u2022\nfailure to anticipate or respond quickly to relevant market trends or to implement successful advertising and marketing programs, including technology-based programs.\nIn addition, if economic conditions deteriorate or are uncertain for a prolonged period of time, or if our operating results decline unexpectedly, we may be required to record impairment charges, which will negatively impact our results of operations for the periods in which they are recorded. Due to the foregoing or other factors, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for a full fiscal year. These fluctuations may cause our operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, and may adversely impact our stock price.\nRisks Related to Food and Commodity Costs and Availability. We and our franchisees are subject to volatility in food and commodity costs and availability. Accordingly, our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs and availability. For example, the costs of feed ingredients used to produce beef, pork and chicken could be adversely affected by changes in worldwide supply or demand, or by regulatory or societal mandates, leading to higher prices for our products. In past years, food and commodity costs increased significantly, out-pacing general inflation and industry expectations. Looking forward, we anticipate volatile or uncertain price conditions to continue.\nWe seek to manage food and commodity costs, including through extended fixed price contracts, strong category and commodity management, and purchasing fundamentals. However, certain commodities such as beef and pork, which currently represent approximately 20% and 7%, respectively, of our consolidated commodity spend, do not lend themselves to fixed price contracts.\nWe cannot assure you that we will successfully enter into fixed price contracts on a timely basis or on commercially favorable pricing terms. In addition, although we have fixed price contracts for produce, we are subject to force majeure clauses resulting from weather or acts of God that may result in temporary spikes in costs.\nFurther, we cannot assure you that we or our franchisees will be able to successfully anticipate and react effectively to changing food and commodity costs by adjusting purchasing practices or menu offerings. We and our franchisees also may not be able to pass along price increases to our customers as a result of adverse economic conditions, competitive pricing or other factors. Therefore, variability of food and other commodity costs could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nRisk Related to Our Brands and Reputation. Multi-unit food service businesses such as ours can be materially and adversely affected by widespread negative publicity of any type, particularly regarding food quality, food safety, nutritional content, safety or public health issues (such as epidemics or the prospect of a pandemic), obesity or other health concerns, and employee relations issues, among other things. Adverse publicity in these areas could damage the trust customers place in our brands. The increasingly widespread use of mobile communications and social media applications has amplified the speed and scope of adverse publicity and could hamper our ability to promptly correct misrepresentations or otherwise respond effectively to negative publicity. To minimize the risk of food safety issues arising in our restaurants and at our vendors, we have restaurant Food Safety programs that include a daily restaurant Food Safety Checklist, and we use third-party and internal audits to review the Food Safety programs of our vendors. Nevertheless, food safety risks cannot be completely eliminated. Any outbreak of illness attributed to company or franchised restaurants, or within the food service industry, or any widespread negative publicity regarding our brands or the restaurant industry in general could cause a decline in company and franchise restaurant sales, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the success of our business strategy depends on the value and relevance of our brands and reputation, including implementation and success of brand strategies. If customers perceive that we and our franchisees fail to deliver a consistently positive and relevant experience, our brands could suffer. This could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, while we devote considerable efforts and resources to protecting our trademarks and other intellectual property, if these efforts are not successful, the value of our brands may be harmed. This could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSupply and Distribution Risks. Dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh produce and other food products subjects food service businesses such as ours to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply could adversely affect the availability, quality or cost of ingredients or require us to incur additional costs to obtain adequate supplies. Deliveries of supplies may be affected by adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, distributor or supplier financial or solvency issues, product recalls, or other issues. Further, increases in fuel prices could result in increased distribution costs. In addition, if any of our distributors, suppliers, vendors or other contractors fail to meet our quality standards or otherwise do not perform adequately, or if any one or more of such entities seeks to terminate its agreement or fails to perform as anticipated, or if there is any disruption in any of our distribution or supply relationships or operations for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected.\nRisks Associated with Severe Weather, Natural Disasters or Civil Unrest. Food service businesses such as ours can be materially and adversely affected by severe weather conditions, such as severe storms, hurricanes, flooding, prolonged drought or protracted heat or cold waves, and by natural disasters, such as earthquakes and wild fires, and their aftermath. Any of these, or civil disturbances or unrest, could result in:\n\u2022\nlost restaurant sales when consumers stay home or are physically prevented from reaching the restaurants;\n\u2022\nproperty damage, loss of product, and resulting lost sales when locations are forced to close for extended periods of time;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in supply when distributors or vendors suffer damages or transportation is negatively affected; and\n\u2022\nincreased costs if agricultural capacity is diminished or if insurance recoveries do not cover all of our losses.\nIf systemic or widespread adverse changes in climate or weather patterns occur, we could experience more of these losses, and such losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nGrowth and Development Risks. We intend to grow both Qdoba and Jack in the Box by developing additional company-owned restaurants and through new restaurant development by franchisees, both in existing markets and in new markets. Development involves substantial risks, including the risk of:\n\u2022\nthe inability to identify suitable franchisees;\n\u2022\nlimited availability of financing for the Company and for franchisees at acceptable rates and terms;\n\u2022\ndevelopment costs exceeding budgeted or contracted amounts;\n\u2022\ndelays in completion of construction;\n\u2022\nthe inability to identify, or the unavailability of suitable sites at acceptable cost and other leasing or purchase terms;\n\u2022\ndeveloped properties not achieving desired revenue or cash flow levels once opened;\n\u2022\nthe negative impact of a new restaurant upon sales at nearby existing restaurants;\n\u2022\nthe challenge of developing in areas where competitors are more established or have greater penetration or access to suitable development sites;\n\u2022\nincurring substantial unrecoverable costs in the event a development project is abandoned prior to completion;\n\u2022\nimpairment charges resulting from underperforming restaurants or decisions to curtail or cease investment in certain locations or markets;\n\u2022\nin new geographic markets where we have limited or no existing locations, the inability to successfully expand or acquire critical market presence for our brands, acquire name recognition, successfully market our products or attract new customers;\n\u2022\noperating cost levels that reduce the demand for, or raise the cost of, developing new restaurants;\n\u2022\nunique regulations or challenges applicable to operating in non-traditional locations, such as airports, college campuses, military or government facilities;\n\u2022\nthe challenge of identifying, recruiting and training qualified restaurant management;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain all required permits;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws, regulations and interpretations, including interpretations of the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and business conditions.\nAlthough we manage our growth and development activities to help reduce such risks, we cannot assure that our present or future growth and development activities will perform in accordance with our expectations. Our inability to expand in accordance with our plans or to manage the risks associated with our growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Franchisee Financial and Business Operations. The opening and continued success of franchise restaurants depends on various factors, including the demand for our franchises, the selection of appropriate franchisee candidates, the identification and availability of suitable sites, negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations, permitting and regulatory compliance, the ability to meet construction schedules, the availability of financing, and the financial and other capabilities of our franchisees and developers. See \u201cGrowth and Development Risks\u201d above. Despite our due diligence performed during the recruiting process, we cannot assure you that franchisees and developers planning the opening of franchise restaurants will have the business abilities or sufficient access to financial resources necessary to open the restaurants required by their agreements, or will prove to be effective operators and remain aligned with us on operations, pricing, promotional or capital-intensive initiatives.\nOur franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as standards set forth in our agreements with them. However, franchisees are independent third parties whom we cannot and do not control beyond the terms of our agreements with them. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in an effective or profitable manner or consistent with applicable laws and required standards, royalty, and in some cases rent, payments to us may be adversely affected. If customers have negative perceptions or experiences with the operational execution, food quality or safety at our franchised locations, the image and reputation of our brands could be harmed, which in turn could negatively impact our business and operating results. Also, if franchisee employees have negative experiences and stage work stoppages or otherwise produce bad publicity, this could negatively impact brand equity.\nWith an increase in the proportion of Jack in the Box franchised restaurants, the percentage of our revenues derived from royalties and rents at Jack in the Box franchise restaurants has increased and is anticipated to continue to increase, as has the risk that earnings could be negatively impacted by defaults in the payment of royalties and rents. As small businesses, some of our franchise operators may be negatively and disproportionately impacted by strategic initiatives, capital requirements, inflation, labor costs, employee relations issues or other causes. In addition, franchisees\u2019 business obligations may not be limited to the operation of Jack in the Box or Qdoba restaurants, making them subject to business and financial risks unrelated to the operation of our restaurants. These unrelated risks could adversely affect a franchisee\u2019s ability to make payments to us or to make payments on a timely basis. We cannot assure that franchisees will successfully participate in our strategic or marketing initiatives or operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with our concepts and standards. As compared to some of our competitors, our Jack in the Box brand has relatively fewer franchisees who, on average, operate more restaurants per franchisee. There are significant risks to our business if a franchisee, particularly one who operates a large number of restaurants, encounters financial difficulties or fails to adhere to our standards and projects an image inconsistent with our brands.\nRisk Relating to Competition, Menu Innovation and Successful Execution of our Operational Strategies and Initiatives. As part of our long term business plan, in addition to growth through development of new restaurants, we are focused on increasing same-store sales and average unit volumes. These plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including risks related to competition, menu innovation and identification and execution of successful operational strategies and initiatives. The restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location, personnel, advertising, brand identification and the type, quality and appeal of menu items and new and differentiated service offerings. There are many well-established competitors. Each of our restaurants competes directly and indirectly with a large number of national and regional restaurant chains, as well as with locally-owned and/or independent quick-service restaurants, fast-casual restaurants, casual dining restaurants, sandwich shops and similar types of businesses. The trend toward convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services has and may continue to increase the number of our competitors. Such increased competition could decrease the demand for our products and negatively affect our sales and profitability. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, operating and other resources than we have, which may give them a competitive advantage. Certain of our competitors have introduced a variety of new products and service offerings and engaged in substantial price discounting, and may adopt similar strategies in the future. In an effort to increase same-store sales and AUVs, we continue to make improvements to our facilities, to implement new service and training initiatives, and to introduce new products and discontinue other menu items. However, there can be no assurance that our facility improvements will foster increases in sales and yield the desired return on investment, that our service initiatives or our overall strategies will be successful, that our menu offerings and promotions will generate sufficient customer interest or acceptance to increase sales, or that competitive product offerings, pricing and promotions will not have an adverse effect upon our margins, sales results and financial condition. In addition, the success of our strategy depends on, among other factors, our ability to motivate restaurant personnel and franchisees to execute our initiatives and achieve sustained high service levels.\nAdvertising and Promotion Risks. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which enable them to purchase significantly more advertising, particularly television and radio ads, than we are able to purchase. Should our competitors increase spending on advertising and promotion, or should the cost of advertising increase or our advertising funds decrease for any reason, including reduced sales or implementation of reduced spending strategies, or should our advertising and promotion be less effective than our competitors, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The growing prevalence and importance of social media platforms, behavioral advertising and mobile technology also pose challenges and risks for our marketing, advertising and promotional strategies. Failure to effectively use these platforms or technology could cause our advertising to be less effective than our competitors. Moreover, improper or damaging use of social media or mobile technology, including by our employees, franchisees, or guests could increase the Company\u2019s costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could also have a materially adverse effect on our results.\nTaxes. Our income tax provision is sensitive to expected earnings and, as those expectations change, our income tax provisions may vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. In addition, from time to time, we may take positions for filing our tax returns that differ from the treatment for financial reporting purposes. The ultimate outcome of such positions could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate.\nRisks Related to Reducing Operating Costs. During the current and recent years, we have identified strategies and taken steps to reduce operating costs to align with increased Jack in the Box franchise ownership and to further integrate Jack in the Box and Qdoba brand restaurant systems. These strategies include outsourcing certain functions, reducing headcount, relocating the Qdoba corporate support center to San Diego and integrating restaurant information systems between our brands. The ability to reduce our operating costs through these initiatives is subject to risks and uncertainties, and we cannot assure that these activities, or any other activities that we may undertake in the future, will achieve the desired cost savings and efficiencies. Failure to achieve such desired savings, or business disruption resulting from these strategies, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Loss of Key Personnel. We believe that our success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain the services of skilled personnel, including key executives. The loss of services of any such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations, Including Regulations Increasing Labor Costs. The restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations as described in Item 1 under \u201cRegulation.\u201d We are subject to rules and regulations including but not limited to those related to:\n\u2022\nthe preparation, ingredients, labeling, packaging, advertising and sale of food and beverages;\n\u2022\nbuilding and zoning requirements;\n\u2022\nsanitation and safety standards;\n\u2022\nemployee healthcare, including the implementation and legal, regulatory and cost implications of the Affordable Care Act;\n\u2022\nlabor and employment, including minimum wage adjustments, overtime, working conditions, employment eligibility and documentation, sick leave, and other employee benefit and fringe benefit requirements, Service Contract Act requirements for restaurants located on military bases, and changing judicial, administrative or regulatory interpretations of federal or state labor laws;\n\u2022\nthe registration, offer, sale, termination and renewal of franchises;\n\u2022\ntruth-in-advertising, consumer protection and the security of information;\n\u2022\nAmericans with Disabilities Act;\n\u2022\npayment cards;\n\u2022\nalcohol sales; and\n\u2022\nclimate change, including regulations related to the potential impact of greenhouse gases, water consumption, or a tax on carbon emissions.\nThe increasing amount and complexity of regulations and their interpretation may increase the costs to us and our franchisees of labor and compliance, and increase our exposure to legal and regulatory claims which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we strive to comply with all applicable existing statutory and administrative rules, we cannot predict the effect on operations from issuance of additional requirements in the future.\nRisks Related to Computer Systems, Information Technology and Cyber Security. We and our franchisees rely on computer systems and information technology to conduct our business. A material failure or interruption of service, or a breach in security of our computer systems caused by malware or other attack, could cause reduced efficiency in operations, loss or misappropriation of data, or business interruptions, or could impact delivery of food to restaurants or financial functions such as vendor payment or employee payroll. We have business continuity plans that attempt to anticipate and mitigate such failures, but it is possible that significant capital investment could be required to rectify these problems, or more likely that cash flows could be impacted.\nWe have instituted controls intended to protect our computer systems, our point of sale (\u201cPOS\u201d) systems, and our information technology systems, to adhere to payment card industry data security standards and to limit third party access for vendors that require access to our restaurant networks. However, we cannot control every security risk, particularly those affecting our franchise locations which are independent businesses. Our security architecture is decentralized, such that payment card information is primarily confined to the restaurant where the specific transaction took place. However, a security breach involving our POS, personnel, franchise operations reporting or other systems could result in disclosure or theft of confidential customer or employee or other proprietary data, and potentially cause loss of consumer confidence or potential costs, fines and litigation, including costs associated with reputational damage, consumer fraud or privacy breach. These risks may be magnified by the increased use of mobile communications and other new technologies, and are subject to increased and changing regulations. The costs of compliance and risk mitigation planning, including increased investment in technology or personnel in order to protect valuable business or consumer information, may negatively impact our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Failure of Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. We maintain a documented system of internal controls over financial reporting, which is reviewed and monitored by an Internal Controls Committee and tested by the Company\u2019s full-time Internal Audit Department. The Internal Audit Department reports to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We believe we have a well-designed system to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting; however, we cannot be certain that our controls will be adequate in the future or that adequate controls will be effective in preventing or detecting all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. If our internal controls are ineffective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. Any failures in the effectiveness of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations.\nEnvironmental and Land Risks and Regulations. We own or lease the real properties on which our Jack in the Box company-operated restaurants are located, and we either own or lease (and subsequently lease/sublease to the franchisee) a majority of our Jack in the Box franchised restaurant sites. We also own or lease the real properties upon which our company-operated Qdoba restaurants are located, and lease (and subsequently sublease to the franchisee) one of our Qdoba franchised restaurant sites. Further, we own our principal executive offices, our Innovation Center and approximately four acres of undeveloped land directly adjacent to the Innovation Center, and lease the Qdoba corporate support center and some regional office space. We have engaged and continue to engage in real estate development projects. As is the case with any owner or operator of real property, we are subject to eminent domain proceedings that can impact the value of investments we have made in real property, and we are subject to other potential liabilities and damages arising out of owning, operating, leasing or otherwise having interests in real property. In addition, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. Failure to comply with environmental laws could result in the imposition by governmental agencies or courts of law of severe penalties or restrictions on our operations. We are unaware of any significant h\nazards for which we are responsible on properties we own or have owned, or operate or have operated. Accordingly, we do not have environmental liability insurance for our restaurants, nor do we maintain a reserve to cover such events. In the event of the determination of contamination on such properties, the Company, as owner or operator, could be held liable for severe penalties and costs of remediation, and this could result in material liability.\nRisks Related to Leverage. As of October 2, 2016, the Company has a credit facility comprised of a $900.0 million revolving credit agreement and a $700.0 million term loan. We may also request the issuance of up to $75.0 million in letters of credit, the outstanding amount of which reduces our net borrowing capacity under the credit agreement. For additional information related to our credit facility, refer to Note 7, Indebtedness, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Increased leverage resulting from borrowings under our credit facility could have certain material adverse effects on the Company, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes could be impaired, or any such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flows could be required for debt service and, as a result, might not be available for our operations or other purposes;\n\u2022\nany substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or any substantial increase in expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements or could force us to modify our operations or sell assets;\n\u2022\nour ability to operate our business and our ability to repurchase stock or pay cash dividends to our stockholders may be restricted by the financial and other covenants set forth in the credit facility;\n\u2022\nour ability to withstand competitive pressures may be decreased; and\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business, regulatory and economic conditions.\nOur ability to repay expected borrowings under our credit facility and to meet our other debt or contractual obligations (including compliance with applicable financial covenants) will depend upon our future performance and our cash flows from operations, both of which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other known and unknown risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control. In addition, to the extent that banks in our revolving credit facility become insolvent, our ability to borrow to the full level of our facility could be limited.\nRisks of Market Volatility. Many factors affect the trading price of our stock, including factors over which we have no control, such as reports on the economy, the industry or the price of commodities, as well as negative or positive announcements by competitors, regardless of whether the report relates directly to our business. In addition to investor expectations about our prospects, trading activity in our stock can reflect the portfolio strategies and investment allocation changes of institutional holders and non-operating initiatives such as a share repurchase program. Any failure to meet market expectations whether for sales, growth rates, refranchising goals, earnings per share or other metrics could cause our share price to drop.\nRisks of Changes in Accounting Policies and Assumptions. Changes in accounting standards, policies or related interpretations by accountants or regulatory entities may negatively impact our results. Many accounting standards require management to make subjective assumptions and estimates, such as those required for long-lived assets, retirement benefits, self-insurance, restaurant closing costs, goodwill and other intangibles, legal accruals, and income taxes. Changes in those underlying assumptions and estimates could significantly change our results.\nLitigation. We are subject to complaints or litigation brought by former, current or prospective employees, customers, franchisees, vendors, landlords, shareholders or others. We assess contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual in our financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Because lawsuits are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. However, the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. A judgment that is not covered by insurance or that is significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend, and may divert management\u2019s attention away from operations and hurt our performance. Further, adverse publicity resulting from claims against us or our franchisees may harm our business or that of our franchisees.", "PERMNO": 77453, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "JACK"}
