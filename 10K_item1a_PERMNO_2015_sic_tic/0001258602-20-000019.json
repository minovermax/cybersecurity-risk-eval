RISK FACTORS\nWe operate our businesses in a highly competitive and regulated environment. We are subject to risks including, but not limited to, strategic, market, liquidity, credit, regulatory, technology, operational, security, and other business risks such as reputation damage related to negative publicity and dependencies on key personnel, customers, vendors, and systems. This section highlights specific risks that could adversely affect our financial results and condition and the value of, and return on, an investment in the Company. Although this section attempts to highlight key risk factors, other risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict all risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information included in this report.\nLoan Portfolio\nOur loan portfolio is subject to certain risks related to interest rates, our ability to manage the risks related to interest rates, prepayment, and credit risk, each of which could reduce the expected cash flows and earnings on our portfolio.\nInterest rate risk - basis and repricing risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk because the interest rate characteristics of our loan assets do not always match the interest rate characteristics of the funding for those assets.\nWe fund the majority of our FFELP student loan assets with one-month or three-month LIBOR indexed floating rate securities. Meanwhile, the interest earned on our FFELP student loan assets is indexed to one-month LIBOR, three-month commercial paper, and Treasury bill rates. The differing interest rate characteristics of our loan assets versus the liabilities funding these assets result in basis risk, which impacts the excess spread earned on our loans. We also face repricing risk due to the timing of the interest rate resets on our liabilities, which may occur as infrequently as once a quarter, in contrast to the timing of the interest rate resets on our assets, which generally occur daily. In a declining interest rate environment, this may cause our student loan spread to compress, while in a rising interest rate environment, it may cause the spread to increase.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $18.9 billion, $0.8 billion, and $0.6 billion of FFELP loans indexed to the one-month LIBOR, three-month commercial paper, and three-month Treasury bill rate, respectively, all of which reset daily, and $7.5 billion of debt indexed to three-month LIBOR, which resets quarterly, and $11.0 billion of debt indexed to one-month LIBOR, which resets monthly. While these indices are all short term in nature with rate movements that are highly correlated over a longer period of time, there can be no assurance that the indices' historically high level of correlation will not be disrupted in the future due to capital market dislocations or other factors not within our control. In such circumstances, our earnings could be adversely affected, possibly to a material extent.\nWe have entered into basis swaps to hedge our basis and repricing risk. For these derivatives, we receive three-month LIBOR set discretely in advance and pay one-month LIBOR plus or minus a spread as defined in the agreements (the \"1:3 Basis Swaps\").\nInterest rate risk - loss of floor income\nFFELP loans originated prior to April 1, 2006 generally earn interest at the higher of the borrower rate, which is fixed over a period of time, or a floating rate based on the Special Allowance Payments (\"SAP\") formula set by the Department. The SAP rate is based on an applicable index plus a fixed spread that depends on loan type, origination date, and repayment status. We generally finance our student loan portfolio with variable rate debt. In low and/or certain declining interest rate environments, when the fixed borrower rate is higher than the SAP rate, these student loans earn at a fixed rate while the interest on the variable rate debt typically continues to reflect the low and/or declining interest rates. In these interest rate environments, we may earn additional spread income that we refer to as floor income.\nDepending on the type of loan and when it was originated, the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to an annual rate each July 1. As a result, for loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term, we may earn floor income for an extended period of time, which we refer to as fixed rate floor income, and for those loans where the borrower rate is reset annually on July 1, we may earn floor income to the next reset date, which we refer to as variable rate floor income.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we earned $89.9 million of fixed rate floor income, which includes $40.2 million of net settlement proceeds received related to derivatives used to hedge loans earning fixed rate floor income. Absent the use of derivative instruments, a rise in interest rates will reduce the amount of floor income received and this will have an impact on earnings due to interest margin compression caused by increased financing costs, until such time as the federally insured loans earn interest at a variable rate in accordance with their SAP formulas. In higher interest rate environments, where the interest rate rises above the borrower rate and fixed rate loans effectively convert to variable rate loans, the impact of the rate fluctuations is reduced.\nInterest rate risk - use of derivatives\nWe utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity. Our derivative instruments are intended as economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting; consequently, the change in fair value, called the \u201cmark-to-market,\u201d of these derivative instruments is included in our operating results. Changes or shifts in the forward yield curve can and have significantly impacted the valuation of our derivatives. Accordingly, changes or shifts in the forward yield curve will impact our results of operations.\nAlthough we believe our derivative instruments are highly effective, developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates is complex, and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations. Because many of our derivatives are not balance guaranteed to a particular pool of student loans and we may not elect to fully hedge our risk on a notional and/or duration basis, we are subject to the risk of being under or over hedged, which could result in material losses. In addition, our interest rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial mark-to-market losses if interest rates move in a materially different way than was expected based on the environment when the derivatives were entered into. As a result, there is no assurance that our economic hedging activities will effectively manage our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFTC with substantial authority to regulate over-the-counter derivative transactions. Since June 10, 2013, the CFTC has required over-the-counter derivative transactions to be executed through an exchange or central clearinghouse. Accordingly, all over-the-counter derivative contracts executed by us since that date are cleared post-execution at a regulated clearinghouse. Clearing is a process by which a third-party, the clearinghouse, steps in between the original counterparties and guarantees the performance of both, by requiring that each post substantial amounts of liquid collateral on an initial (initial margin) and mark-to-market (variation margin) basis to cover the clearinghouse's potential future exposure in the event of default. The clearing requirements require us to post substantial amounts of liquid collateral when executing new derivative instruments, which could negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and may prevent or limit us from utilizing derivative instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity and risks. However, the clearing requirements reduce counterparty risk associated with over-the-counter derivative instruments executed by us after June 10, 2013.\nFor derivatives executed on and prior to June 10, 2013 or not required to be executed through an exchange or central clearinghouse (\"non-centrally cleared derivatives\"), we are exposed to credit risk. However, the majority of our derivatives currently outstanding and anticipated to be executed in future periods are and will be executed and cleared at a regulated clearinghouse, thus, significantly reducing counterparty credit risk on our derivative portfolio.\nInterest rate movements have an impact on the amount of collateral we are required to deposit with our derivative instrument counterparties (for non-centrally cleared derivatives) and variation margin payments with our clearinghouse (for centrally cleared derivatives). We attempt to manage market risk associated with interest rates by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken. Our derivative portfolio and hedging strategy is reviewed periodically by our internal risk committee and our board of directors' Risk and Finance Committee.\nWith our current derivative portfolio, which consists primarily of interest rate swaps to hedge floor income and basis swaps to hedge basis and repricing risk, we do not currently anticipate a near term movement in interest rates having a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources, nor expect future movements in interest rates to have a material impact on our ability to meet potential collateral deposit requirements with our counterparties and/or make variation margin payments to our clearinghouse. Based on the interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2019, if the forward interest rate curve was 50 basis points lower for the remaining duration of these derivatives, we would have been required to pay approximately $10 million in additional collateral and/or variation margin. In addition, if the forward basis curve between one-month and three-month LIBOR experienced a ten basis point reduction in spread for the remaining duration of our 1:3 Basis Swaps (in which we pay one-month LIBOR and receive three-month LIBOR), we would have been required to post approximately $25 million in additional collateral and/or variation margin. Due to the existing low interest rate environment, our exposure to downward movements in interest rates on our interest rate swaps is limited. In addition, we believe the historical high correlation between one-month and three-month LIBOR limits our exposure to interest rate movements on the 1:3 Basis Swaps.\nHowever, if interest rates move materially and negatively impact the fair value of our derivative portfolio, the replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark rate as discussed below has significant adverse impacts on our derivatives, or if we enter into additional derivatives in which the fair value of such derivatives becomes negative, we could be required to pay a significant amount of collateral to our derivative instrument counterparties and/or variation margin to our clearinghouse. These payments, if significant, could negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources.\nInterest rate risk - replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark rate\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) is a widely accepted interest rate benchmark referenced in financial contracts globally and is used to determine interest rates on commercial and consumer loans, bonds, derivatives, and numerous other financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the interest earned on a principal amount of $18.9 billion in our FFELP student loan asset portfolio was indexed to one-month LIBOR, and the interest paid on a principal amount of $18.4 billion of our FFELP student loan asset-backed debt securities was indexed to one-month or three-month LIBOR. In addition, the majority of our derivative financial instrument transactions used to manage LIBOR interest rate risks are indexed to LIBOR.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. Accordingly, there is significant uncertainty regarding the availability of LIBOR as a benchmark rate after 2021. In April 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York commenced publication of three reference rates based on overnight United States Treasury repurchase agreement transactions, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which has been recommended as an alternative to United States dollar LIBOR by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee. Uncertainty exists as to the transition process and broad acceptance of SOFR as the primary alternative to LIBOR, including what effect it would have on the value of LIBOR-based securities, financial contracts, and variable rate loans. Although the indentures for student loan asset-backed debt securities issued in our most recent LIBOR-indexed securitization transactions include new interest rate determination fallback provisions emerging in the market for new issuances of LIBOR-indexed debt securities, many of the contracts for our existing LIBOR-indexed assets, liabilities, and derivative instruments from historical transactions do not include provisions that contemplated the possibility of a permanent discontinuation of LIBOR and clearly specified a method for transitioning from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark rate, and it is not yet known how the market in general, specific counterparties in particular, the courts, or regulators will address the significant complexities and uncertainties involved in a transition away from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark rate. Specifically, the Department has not yet indicated any market transition away from the current LIBOR framework for paying special allowance payments to holders of FFELP assets. As a result, we cannot predict the impact that a transition from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark rate would have on our existing LIBOR-indexed assets, liabilities, and derivative instruments, but such impact could have material adverse effects on the value, performance, and related cash flows of such LIBOR-indexed items, including our funding costs, net interest income, loan and other asset values, and asset-liability management strategies. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the income and expenses associated with, and the pricing and value of our LIBOR-based assets and liabilities, which include the majority of our FFELP student loan assets and FFELP student loan asset-backed debt securities issued to fund those assets, as well as the majority of our derivative\nfinancial instruments we use to manage LIBOR-based interest rate risks associated with such FFELP student loan-related assets and liabilities;\n\u2022result in uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amounts on our LIBOR-based assets and liabilities depending on the terms of the governing instruments, which in turn could result in disputes, litigation, or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based securities and contracts, and the potential renegotiation of previous contracts;\n\u2022make future asset-backed securitizations more difficult to complete or more expensive until LIBOR or alternative benchmark rate uncertainties are resolved; and\n\u2022result in basis risk if the alternative benchmark rate on our loan assets does not match the alternative benchmark rate for the funding for those assets.\nIn addition, a transition away from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark rate or rates may impact our existing transaction data, systems, operations, pricing, and risk management processes, and require significant efforts to transition to or develop appropriate systems and analytics to reflect a new benchmark rate environment. There can be no assurance that such efforts will successfully mitigate the financial and operational risks associated with a transition away from LIBOR.\nPrepayment risk\nHigher rates of prepayments of student loans, including consolidations by the Department through the Federal Direct Loan Program or private refinancing programs, would reduce our interest income.\nPursuant to the Higher Education Act, borrowers may prepay loans made under the FFEL Program at any time without penalty. Prepayments may result from consolidations of student loans by the Department through the Federal Direct Loan Program or by a lending institution through a private education or unsecured consumer loan, which historically tend to occur more frequently in low interest rate environments; from borrower defaults, which will result in the receipt of a guaranty payment; and from voluntary full or partial prepayments; among other things.\nLegislative risk exists as Congress evaluates proposals to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. If the federal government and the Department initiate additional loan forgiveness, other repayment options or plans, or consolidation loan programs, such initiatives could further increase prepayments and reduce interest income, and could also reduce servicing fees.\nThe rate of prepayments of student loans may be influenced by a variety of economic, social, political, and other factors affecting borrowers, including interest rates, federal budgetary pressures, and the availability of alternative financing. Our profits could be adversely affected by higher prepayments, which reduce the balance of loans outstanding and, therefore, the amount of interest income we receive.\nCredit risk\nFuture losses due to defaults on loans held by us present credit risk which could adversely affect our earnings.\nThe vast majority (97.7 percent) of our student loan portfolio is federally guaranteed. The allowance for loan losses from the federally insured loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of our loan portfolios, considering loans in repayment versus those in nonpaying status, delinquency status, trends in defaults in the portfolio based on Company and industry data, past experience, trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors, changes to federal student loan programs, current economic conditions, and other relevant qualitative factors. The federal government currently guarantees 97 percent of the principal and interest on federally insured student loans disbursed on and after July 1, 2006 (and 98 percent for those loans disbursed on and after October 1, 1993 and prior to July 1, 2006), which limits our loss exposure on the outstanding balance of our federally insured portfolio. Student loans disbursed prior to October 1, 1993 are fully insured for both principal and interest.\nOur private education and consumer loans are unsecured, with neither a government nor a private insurance guarantee. Accordingly, we bear the full risk of loss on these loans if the borrower and co-borrower, if applicable, default. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on the private education and consumer loans, we consider several factors, including: loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status, delinquency status, type of program, and trends in defaults in the portfolio based on Company and industry data, past experience, current economic conditions, and other relevant qualitative factors. We place our private education and consumer loans on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal and interest is 90 days past due, and charge off the loan when the collection of principal and interest is 120 days or 180 days past due, depending on the type of loan program. We are actively expanding our acquisition of private education and consumer loan portfolios, which increases our exposure to credit risk.\nThe evaluation of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be subject to significant changes. As of December 31, 2019, our allowance for loan losses was $61.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a provision for loan losses of $39.0 million. The provision for loan losses reflects the activity for the applicable period and provides an allowance at a level that management believes is appropriate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. The new CECL standard became effective for us on January 1, 2020. Under the CECL model, we are required to measure and recognize an allowance for loan losses that estimates remaining expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date. This will result in us presenting certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as our loans held for investment, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement takes place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model (the model used by us to recognize credit losses for all periods prior to January 1, 2020), which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. See the MD&A - \u201cRecent Accounting Pronouncements - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for further details on the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements from the adoption of the CECL accounting standard.\nIf future defaults on loans held by us are higher than anticipated, which could result from a variety of factors such as downturns in the economy, regulatory or operational changes, and other unforeseen future trends, or actual performance is significantly worse than currently estimated, our estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses in our statements of income would be materially affected.\nLiquidity and Funding\nThe current maturities of our loan warehouse financing facilities do not match the maturities of the related funded loans, and we may not be able to modify and/or find alternative funding related to the loan collateral in these facilities prior to their expiration.\nThe majority of our portfolio of student loans is funded through asset-backed securitizations that are structured to substantially match the maturities of the funded assets, and there are minimal liquidity issues related to these facilities. We also have loans funded in shorter term warehouse facilities. The current maturities of these facilities do not match the maturity of the related funded assets. Therefore, we will need to modify and/or find alternative funding related to the loan collateral in these facilities prior to their expiration.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we maintained two FFELP warehouse facilities as described in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report. The FFELP warehouse facilities have revolving financing structures supported by liquidity provisions, which expire in May 2020. In the event we are unable to renew the liquidity provisions for a facility, the facility would become a term facility at a stepped-up cost, with no additional student loans being eligible for financing, and we would be required to refinance the existing loans in the facility by the final maturity dates in May 2021 and May 2022, respectively. The FFELP warehouse facilities also contain financial covenants relating to levels of our consolidated net worth, ratio of recourse indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA, and unencumbered cash. Any noncompliance with these covenants could result in a requirement for the immediate repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the facilities. As of December 31, 2019, $778.1 million was outstanding under the FFELP warehouse facilities and $42.6 million was advanced as equity support.\nWe also have a consumer loan warehouse facility that has an aggregate maximum financing amount available of $200.0 million, an advance rate of 70 or 75 percent depending on the type of collateral and subject to certain concentration limits, liquidity provisions to April 23, 2021, and a final maturity date of April 23, 2022. As of December 31, 2019, $116.6 million was outstanding and $41.3 million was advanced as equity support under this warehouse facility.\nIn addition, on February 13, 2020, we closed on a private loan warehouse facility with an aggregate maximum financing amount available of $100.0 million, an advance rate of 90 percent, liquidity provisions through February 15, 2021, and a final maturity date of February 11, 2022.\nIf we are unable to obtain cost-effective funding alternatives for the loans in the warehouse facilities prior to the facilities' maturities, our cost of funds could increase, adversely affecting our results of operations. If we cannot find any funding alternatives, we would lose our collateral, including the loan assets and cash advances, related to these facilities.\nWe are exposed to mark-to-formula collateral support risk on one of our FFELP warehouse facilities.\nOne of our FFELP warehouse facilities has a static advance rate until the expiration date of the liquidity provisions (May 2020). In the event the liquidity provisions are not extended, the valuation agent has the right to perform a one-time mark to market on the underlying loans funded in this facility, subject to a floor. The loans would then be funded at this new advance rate until the final maturity date of the facility.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $489.3 million was outstanding under this warehouse facility and $21.7 million was advanced as equity support. In the event that the liquidity provisions are not renewed, a significant change in the valuation of loans could result in additional required equity funding support for this warehouse facility greater than what we can provide, which could result in an event of default resulting in termination of the facility and an acceleration of the repayment provisions. If we cannot find any funding alternatives, we would lose our collateral, including the student loan assets and cash advances, related to this facility. A default on the FFELP warehouse facility would also result in an event of default on our $455.0 million unsecured line of credit that would result in the outstanding balance on the line of credit becoming immediately due and payable.\nChanges in ratings on asset-backed securitization transactions, including those we sponsor, can have a material adverse impact on our ability to access the asset-backed securities market.\nAfter securitizations are initially issued, if their performance does not align with rating agencies' expectations at the time of issuance, or if the rating agencies modify their assumptions and methodologies used for rating student loan securitizations, it is possible that initial high quality ratings on our subsidiaries\u2019 securitizations, or those of other asset-backed securities issuers, could be materially lowered. Such actions could adversely affect our ability to access the asset-backed securities market, or make new securitization transactions more expensive by requiring us to pay a higher spread over LIBOR when pricing new bonds.\nOperations\nRisks associated with our operations, as further discussed below, include those related to the importance of maintaining scale by retaining existing customers and attracting new business opportunities, our information technology systems and potential security and privacy breaches, and our ability to manage performance related to regulatory requirements.\nOur largest fee-based customer, the Department of Education, represented 30 percent of our revenue in 2019. Failure to extend the Department contracts or obtain new Department contracts for different components, our inability to consistently surpass competitor performance metrics, or unfavorable contract modifications or interpretations, could significantly lower loan servicing revenue and hinder future servicing opportunities.\nWith the acquisition of Great Lakes, we are two of four TIVAS awarded a student loan servicing contract by the Department to provide additional servicing capacity for loans owned by the Department. The Department also has contracts with 31 NFP entities to service student loans, although currently five NFP servicers service the volume allocated to these 31 entities. As of December 31, 2019, Nelnet Servicing was servicing $183.8 billion of student loans for 5.6 million borrowers under its contract, and Great Lakes was servicing $240.0 billion of student loans for 7.4 million borrowers under its contract. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $343.6 million in revenue from the Department under these contracts, which represented 30 percent of our revenue.\nThe current servicing contracts with the Department expire on December 14, 2020 and provide the potential for two additional six-month extensions at the Department\u2019s discretion through December 14, 2021.\nThe Department's Office of Federal Student Aid (\u201cFSA\u201d) is conducting a contract procurement process entitled Next Generation Financial Services Environment (\u201cNextGen\u201d) for a new framework for the servicing of all student loans owned by the Department. On January 15, 2019, FSA issued solicitations for three new NextGen components:\n\u2022NextGen Enhanced Processing Solution (\u201cEPS\u201d)\n\u2022NextGen Business Process Operations (\u201cBPO\u201d)\n\u2022NextGen Optimal Processing Solution (\u201cOPS\u201d)\nOn April 1, 2019 and October 4, 2019, the Company responded to the EPS component. On January 16, 2020 FSA released an amendment to the EPS component and the Company responded on February 3, 2020. In addition, on August 1, 2019, the Company responded to the BPO component. On January 10, 2020 FSA released an amendment to the BPO component and the Company responded on January 30, 2020. The Company is also part of a team that has responded and intends to respond to various aspects of the OPS component; however, on November 12, 2019, FSA put an indefinite hold on the OPS solicitation.\nIn the event that our servicing contracts are not extended beyond the current expiration date or we are not chosen as a subsequent servicer, loan servicing revenue would decrease significantly. There are significant risks and uncertainties regarding the current Department contracts and potential future Department contracts, including potential delays, cancellations, or material changes to the structure of the contract procurement process, and uncertainties as to the terms and requirements under a potential new contract or contracts with the Department. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of the Department's contract procurement solicitations.\nNew loan volume is currently allocated among the four TIVAS and five NFP servicers based on certain performance metrics established by the Department and compared among all loan servicers in this group. The amount of future allocations of new loan volume could be negatively impacted if we are unable to consistently surpass comparable competitor and/or other performance metrics.\nIn the event the current Department servicing contracts become subject to unfavorable modifications or interpretations by the Department, loan servicing revenue could decrease significantly. For example, as of January 2020, a change instituted by the Department required enrollment in the Ongoing Security Authorization (OSA) program that requires quarterly control assessments. The OSA program replaced the previous Authority to Operate (ATO) triennial assessment process. Because the OSA program is a novel process, we may encounter unforeseen issues with the Department, including differing interpretations on compliance controls and reporting requirements. Our inability to remediate any such issues to the satisfaction of the Department may cause a temporary or permanent injunction on servicing student loans under the contracts.\nAdditionally, we are partially dependent on the existing Department contracts to broaden servicing operations with the Department, other federal and state agencies, and commercial clients. The size and importance of these contracts provide us the scale and infrastructure needed to profitably expand into new business opportunities. Failure to extend the Department contracts beyond the current expiration date, or obtain new Department contracts, could significantly hinder future opportunities, as well as result in potential impairment and restructuring charges that may be necessary to re-align our cost structure with our servicing operations.\nA failure of our operating systems or infrastructure could disrupt our businesses, cause significant losses, result in regulatory action, and damage our reputation.\nWe operate many different businesses in diverse markets and depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems, software, datacenters, cloud services providers, telecommunications systems, and the rest of our operating systems and infrastructure to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with contractual, legal, regulatory, and our own standards. Such systems and infrastructure could be disrupted because of a cyberattack, spikes in transaction volume, power outages, telecommunications failures, degradation or loss of internet or website availability, natural disasters, political or social unrest, and terrorist acts. A significant adverse incident could damage our reputation and credibility, lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of customers or revenue, and result in regulatory action, in addition to increased costs to service our customers and protect our network. Such event also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, networks, or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our business continuity plans may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Any significant loss of customers or revenue, or significant increase in costs of serving those customers, could adversely affect our growth, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOperating system and infrastructure risks continue to increase in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to support and process customer transactions, the increased number and complexity of transactions being processed, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. In addition, to access our services and products, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablet PCs, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems.\nMalicious and abusive activities, such as the dissemination of computer viruses, worms, and other destructive or disruptive software, internal and external threats, computer hackings, social engineering, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, ransomware or ransom demands to not expose vulnerabilities in systems, and other malicious activities have become more common. These activities could have adverse consequences on our network and our customers, including degradation of service, excessive call volume, and damage to our or our customers' equipment and data. Although to date we have not experienced a material loss relating to cyberattacks or system outage, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future or that there is not a current threat that remains undetected at this time. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, and the size and scale of our services.\nWe could also incur losses resulting from the risk of unauthorized access to our computer systems, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal\ncontrol system and compliance requirements, and failures to properly execute business continuation and disaster recovery plans. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems, or unauthorized employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, potential legal actions, fines, or civil monetary penalties that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity and damage to our reputation.\nAs a result of the above risks, we continue to develop and enhance our training, controls, processes, and practices designed to protect, monitor, and restore our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access, and this remains a priority for us, each of our business segments, and our Board of Directors. Even though we maintain technology and telecommunication, professional services, media, network security, privacy, injury, and liability insurance coverage to offset costs that may be incurred as a result of a cyberattack, information security breach, or extended system outage, this insurance coverage may not cover all costs of such incidents.\nA security breach of our information technology systems could result in the disclosure of confidential customer and other information, significant financial losses and legal exposure, and damage to our reputation.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal, confidential and other information in our information technology systems, including customer, personnel, and vendor data. Although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our systems, software and networks and to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, we experience increasingly numerous and more sophisticated daily attacks on our systems, and our security measures may not be entirely effective.\nWe may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all types of potential security breaches, because the techniques used change frequently, generally increase in sophistication, often are not recognized until launched, sometimes go undetected even when successful, and result in security attacks originating from a wide variety of sources, including organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, hostile foreign governments, and other external parties. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data or that of our customers, such as through \u201cphishing\u201d schemes. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile and internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, our customers often use their own devices, such as computers, smart phones, and tablet computers, to make payments and manage their accounts. We have limited ability to assure the safety and security of our customers\u2019 transactions to the extent they are using their own devices, which could be subject to similar threats. A penetration or circumvention of our information security systems, or the intentional or unintentional disclosure, alteration or destruction by an authorized user of confidential information necessary for our operations, could result in serious negative consequences for us. These consequences may include violations of applicable privacy and other laws; financial loss to us or to our customers; loss of confidence in our security measures; customer dissatisfaction; significant litigation exposure; regulatory fines, penalties or intervention; reimbursement or other compensatory costs; additional compliance costs; significant disruption of our business operations; and harm to our reputation. Although to date we have not experienced a material loss relating to information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future or that there is not a current threat that remains undetected at this time.\nIn addition, we routinely transmit and receive large volumes of personal, confidential and proprietary information through third parties. Although we work to ensure that third parties with which we do business maintain information security systems and processes, those measures may not be entirely effective, and an information security breach of a third-party system may not be revealed to us in a timely manner, which could compromise our ability to respond effectively. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a third party could result in material adverse legal liability, regulatory actions, disruptions, and reputational harm with respect to our businesses.\nWe could suffer adverse consequences to the extent that natural disasters, terrorist activities, or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region.\nNatural disasters, terrorist activities, or international hostilities affecting the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region could lead, for example, to an increase in loan delinquencies, borrower bankruptcies, or defaults that could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, and provisions for credit losses. Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of these occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning, and our ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of natural disasters, terrorist activities, or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we transact with, particularly those that we depend upon, but have no control over. Additionally, the force and frequency of natural disasters are increasing as the climate changes.\nNegative publicity could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and financial results.\nNegative public opinion about the Company, our operating segments, or the industries in which we serve could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers and employees, and expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including but not limited to lending practices, cybersecurity breaches, failures to safeguard personal information, loan servicing practices, corporate governance, sales and marketing practices, regulatory compliance, mergers and acquisitions, and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct. Because most of our businesses operate under the Nelnet brand, actual or alleged conduct by one business can result in negative public opinion about other businesses that we operate. Although we take steps to minimize reputational risk in dealing with customers and other constituencies, we are inherently exposed to this risk. In addition, third parties with whom we have important relationships may take actions over which we have limited control that could negatively impact perceptions about us or the industries in which we serve. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood that negative public opinion from any of the events discussed above will impact our reputation and business.\nOur business may suffer if we are not able to retain and attract skilled and qualified employees.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to continually attract and retain key employees. Competition for the best people in our industry can be intense. If we are not able to hire sufficient, qualified employees to support our technology and business operations, or to train, motivate, and retain our employees, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe must adapt to rapid technological change. If we are unable to take advantage of technological developments, or if we adopt and implement them more slowly than our competitors, we may experience a decline in the demand for our products and services.\nOur long-term operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually enhance, develop, introduce, and market new products and services. We must continually and cost-effectively maintain and improve our information technology systems and infrastructure in order to successfully deliver competitive and cost effective products and services to our customers. The widespread adoption of new technologies and market demands could require substantial expenditures to enhance system infrastructure and existing products and services. If we fail to enhance and scale our systems and operational infrastructure or products and services, our operating segments may lose their competitive advantage and this could adversely affect financial and operating results.\nOur software products may experience quality problems and development delays, which could damage client relations, our potential profitability, and expose us to liability.\nOur products, primarily in our NDS and NBS segments, are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that often encounter development delays, and the underlying software may contain undetected bugs or other defects that interfere with its intended operation. Quality problems with our software products and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, loss of credibility with current or potential clients, harm to our reputation, or exposure to liability claims. In addition, we rely on technologies supplied to us by third parties that may also contain undetected errors or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties for a wide array of services for our customers, and to meet our contractual obligations. The failure of a third party with which we work could adversely affect our business performance and reputation.\nWe rely on third parties for a wide array of critical operational services, technology, datacenter hosting facilities, cloud computing platforms, and software. We also rely upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary databases, including data from customers, business partners, and various government sources.\nOur third-party service providers may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, cyberattacks, telecommunications failures, and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements, and litigation to stop, limit or delay operations. If a third-party service provider experiences an outage, we may temporarily lose the ability to conduct certain business activities, which could impact our ability to serve our customers and meet our contractual, legal or regulatory compliance obligations. Our businesses would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. Despite existing precautionary measures, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to discontinue services without adequate notice to us, or other unanticipated problems with third-party service providers could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Even with disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, our services could be interrupted. Some of our third-party service providers may engage vendors of their own as\nthey provide services or technology solutions for our operations, which introduces the same risks that these \u201cfourth parties\u201d could be the source of operational failures.\nIn addition, interruptions at financial or other institutions engaged in data processing and important to the overall functioning of the financial system could also adversely affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of our businesses. The increasing consolidation, interdependence, and complexity of financial entities and technology systems means that a technology failure, cyberattack, or other breach that significantly degrades, deletes, or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including our businesses. This consolidation, interconnectivity, and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both an entity-specific and an industry-wide basis. Third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearinghouses, payment networks, or financial intermediaries, could also be sources of operational risks to our businesses, including with respect to breakdowns or failures of their systems, misconduct by their employees, or cyberattacks that could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to us or result in the loss or compromise of our information or the information of our customers. Our ability to implement back-up systems or other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is limited. Furthermore, an attack on, or failure of, a third-party system may not be revealed to us in a timely manner, which could compromise our ability to respond effectively.\nWhile we have selected the third parties with which we do business carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by third-party service providers, including as a result of not providing their services for any reason or performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver services and products to our customers and otherwise to conduct business. Replacing third-party service providers could also entail significant delay and expense. In addition, failure of third-party service providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect our ability to deliver services and products to our customers and otherwise to conduct business.\nIf any of these third parties experiences financial difficulties, system interruptions, regulatory violations, database disruptions, security threats, or they cannot otherwise meet our specifications, our ability to provide some services may be materially adversely affected, in which case our businesses, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe must satisfy certain requirements necessary to maintain the federal guarantees of our federally insured loans and the federally insured loans that we service for third parties, and we may incur penalties or lose our guarantees if we fail to meet these requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we serviced $33.2 billion of FFELP loans that maintained a federal guarantee, of which $17.5 billion and $15.7 billion were owned by the Company and third-party entities, respectively. We must meet various requirements in order to maintain the federal guarantee on federally insured loans. The federal guarantee on federally insured loans is conditional based on compliance with origination, servicing, and collection policies set by the Department and guaranty agencies. If the Company misinterprets Department guidance, or incorrectly applies the Higher Education Act, the Department could determine that the Company is not in compliance. Federally insured loans that are not originated, disbursed, or serviced in accordance with the Department's and guaranty agency regulations may risk partial or complete loss of the guarantee. If we experience a high rate of servicing deficiencies (including any deficiencies resulting from the conversion of loans from one servicing platform to another, errors in the loan origination process, establishment of the borrower's repayment status, and due diligence or claim filing processes), it could result in the loan guarantee being revoked or denied. In most cases we have the opportunity to cure these deficiencies by following a prescribed cure process which usually involves obtaining the borrower's reaffirmation of the debt. However, not all deficiencies can be cured.\nA guaranty agency may also assess an interest penalty upon claim payment if the deficiency does not result in a loan rejection. These interest penalties are not subject to cure provisions and are typically related to isolated instances of due diligence deficiencies. Additionally, we may become ineligible for special allowance payment benefits from the time of the first deficiency leading to the loan rejection through the date that the loan is cured.\nAs FFELP loan holders, servicers, and guaranty agencies exit the loan program and consolidation within the industry takes place, this increases the complexity of servicing and claim filing due to the amount of loan servicing and loan guaranty transfers and the opportunity for errors at the time a claim is filed.\nFailure to comply with federal and guarantor regulations may result in fines, penalties, the loss of the insurance and related federal guarantees on affected FFELP loans, the loss of special allowance payment benefits, expenses required to cure servicing deficiencies, suspension or termination of the right to participate as a FFELP servicer, negative publicity, and potential legal claims, including potential claims by our servicing customers if they lose the federal guarantee on loans that we service for them. If the Company is subjected to significant fines, or loss of insurance or guarantees on a material number of FFELP loans, or if the Company loses its ability to service FFELP loans, it could have a material, negative impact on the Company's business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur contracts with the Department of Education expose us to additional risks inherent in government contracts.\nThe Federal government could engage in a prolonged debate linking the federal deficit, debt ceiling, government shutdown, and other budget issues. If U.S. lawmakers in the future fail to reach agreement on these issues, the federal government could stop or delay payment on its obligations. Further, legislation to address the federal deficit and spending could impose proposals that would adversely affect the FFEL and Federal Direct Loan Programs' servicing businesses.\nWe contract with FSA to administer loans held by FSA in both the FFEL and Federal Direct Loan Programs, we own a portfolio of FFELP loans, and we service our FFELP loans and loans for third parties. These loan programs are authorized by the Higher Education Act and subject to periodic reauthorization and changes to the programs by the Administration and U.S. Congress. The latest round of reauthorization is taking place currently. We cannot predict what will or will not be in the final law. However, any changes, including the potential for borrowers to refinance loans via Direct Consolidation Loans, could have a material impact to our cash flows from servicing, interest income, and operating margins.\nGovernment entities in the United States often reserve the right to audit contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of business practices. These entities also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding systems, including systems of third parties, used in connection with the performance of the contracts. Negative findings from audits, investigations, or inquiries could affect the contractor\u2019s future revenues and profitability. If improper or illegal activities are found in the course of government audits or investigations, we could become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act. Additionally, we may be subject to administrative sanctions, which may include termination or non-renewal of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions, or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. Due to the inherent limitations of internal controls, it may not be possible to detect or prevent all improper or illegal activities.\nThe Government could change governmental policies, regulatory environments, spending sentiment, and many other factors and conditions, some of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict how or what programs or policies will be impacted by the federal government. The conditions described above could impact not only our contracts with the Department, but also other existing or future contracts with government or commercial entities.\nOur ability to continue to grow and maintain our contracts with commercial businesses and government agencies is partly dependent on our ability to maintain compliance with various laws, regulations, and industry standards applicable to those contracts.\nWe are subject to various laws, regulations, and industry standards related to our commercial and government contracts. In most cases, these contracts are subject to termination rights, audits, and investigations. The laws and regulations that impact our operating segments are outlined in Part I, Item 1, \u201cRegulation and Supervision.\u201d Additionally, our contracts with the federal government require that we maintain internal controls in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (\u201cNIST\u201d) and our operating segments that utilize payment cards are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d). If we are found to be in noncompliance with the contract provisions or applicable laws, regulations, or standards, or the contracted party exercises its termination or other rights for that or other reasons, our reputation could be negatively affected, and our ability to compete for new contracts or maintain existing contracts could diminish. If this were to occur, our results of operations from existing contracts and future opportunities for new contracts could be negatively affected.\nWe could face significant legal and reputational harm if we fail to safeguard the privacy of personal information.\nWe are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations, both inside and outside of the United States, governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. The protected individuals can include our customers, employees, and the customers and employees of our clients, vendors, counterparties, and other third parties. Ensuring the collection, use, transfer, and storage of personal information complies with applicable laws and regulations in relevant jurisdictions can increase operating costs, impact the development of new products or services, and reduce operational efficiency. Any mishandling or misuse of the personal information of customers, employees, or others by the Company or a third party affiliate could expose us to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions. Additional risks could arise if we or an affiliated third party do not provide adequate disclosure or transparency to our customers about the personal information collected from them and its use; fail to receive, document, and honor the privacy preferences expressed by customers; fail to protect personal information from unauthorized disclosure; or fail to maintain proper training on privacy practices for all employees or third parties who have access to personal data. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard personal information and abide by privacy preferences, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause the loss of existing or potential customers and thereby reduce our revenue. In addition, any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, and/or significant liabilities, regulatory fines, penalties, and other sanctions. The regulatory framework for privacy issues is evolving and is likely to continue doing so for the foreseeable future, which creates uncertainty. Because the\ninterpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws and privacy standards are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws or privacy standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations, and privacy standards, could result in additional cost and liability for us, damage our reputation, and harm our business.\nOur failure to successfully manage business and certain asset acquisitions and other investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nThe success of our acquisition of ALLO in December 2015 and continued investment in the communications business depends in large part on the ability of ALLO to successfully develop and expand fiber networks in existing service areas and additional communities within acceptable cost parameters, gain market share in communities in existing service areas, and obtain acceptable market share levels in additional communities that we do not yet serve. ALLO may not be able to achieve those objectives and we may not realize the expected benefits from ALLO. In addition, the expected benefits are subject to risks related to our ability to successfully maintain technological competitive advantages with respect to the offered telecommunications, internet, television, telephone, and other related services and minimize potential system disruptions to the availability, speed, and quality of such services; potential changes in the marketplace, including potential decreases in market pricing for telecommunications and related services; potential changes in the demand for fiber optic internet, television, and telephone services; and increases in transport and content costs as discussed below.\nWe acquired Great Lakes on February 7, 2018. The success of our acquisition of Great Lakes depends on our ability to successfully integrate technology and other operating activities and successfully maintain and increase allocated volumes of student loans serviced by Great Lakes and Nelnet Servicing under existing and any future servicing contracts with the Department. Great Lakes and Nelnet Servicing have also been working to develop a new, state-of-the-art servicing system for government-owned student loans. The servicing platform under development will utilize modern technology to effectively scale for additional volume, protect customer information, and support enhanced borrower experience initiatives. The expected benefits from the servicing platform under development may not be realized.\nWe may acquire other new businesses, products, and services, or enhance existing businesses, products, and services, or make other investments to further diversify our businesses both within and outside of our historical education-related businesses, through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel, or through investments in new asset classes. Any acquisition or investment is subject to a number of risks. Such risks may include diversion of management time and resources, disruption of our ongoing businesses, difficulties in integrating acquisitions, loss of key employees, degradation of services, difficulty expanding information technology systems and other business processes to incorporate the acquired businesses, extensive regulatory requirements, dilution to existing shareholders if our common stock is issued in consideration for an acquisition or investment, incurring or assuming indebtedness or other liabilities in connection with an acquisition, unexpected declines in real estate values or the failure to realize expected benefits from real estate development projects, lack of familiarity with new markets, and difficulties in supporting new product lines. Our failure to successfully manage acquisitions or investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Correspondingly, our expectations as to the accretive nature of the acquisitions or investments could be inaccurate.\nTransport and content costs related to ALLO\u2019s video products and services are substantial and continue to increase.\nThe cost of video transport and content costs is expected to continue to be one of ALLO\u2019s largest operating costs associated with providing television service. Television programming content includes cable-oriented programming, as well as the programming of local over-the-air television stations that ALLO retransmits. In addition, on-demand programming is being made available in response to customer demand. In recent years, the cable industry has experienced rapid increases in the cost of programming, especially the costs for sports programming and for local broadcast station retransmission consent. Programming costs are generally assessed on a per-subscriber basis, and therefore are related directly to the number of subscribers to which the programming is provided. ALLO\u2019s relatively small base of subscribers limits our ability to negotiate lower per-subscriber programming costs, whereas larger providers can often obtain discounts based on the number of their subscribers. This cost difference can cause ALLO to experience reduced operating margins relative to our competitors with a larger subscriber base. In addition, escalators in existing content agreements cause cost increases that are greater than general inflation. While ALLO expects these increases to continue, it may not be able to pass programming cost increases on to customers, particularly as an increasing amount of programming content becomes available via the internet at little or no cost. Also, some competitors (or their affiliates) own national content companies and ALLO may be unable to secure license rights to that programming. As ALLO\u2019s programming contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or at all, in which case ALLO may be unable to provide such television programming, causing business results to be adversely affected.\nIf ALLO cannot obtain and maintain necessary rights-of-way for its communications network, ALLO's operations may be interrupted and it would likely face increased costs.\nALLO is dependent on easements, franchises, pole attachments, and licenses from various private parties such as established telephone companies and other utilities, railroads, and long-distance companies, and from state highway authorities, local governments, and transit authorities for access to aerial pole space, underground conduits, and other rights-of-way in order to construct and operate its networks. Some agreements relating to rights-of-way may be short-term or revocable at will, and ALLO cannot be certain that it will continue to have access to existing rights-of-way after the governing agreements are terminated or expire. If any of ALLO's right-of-way agreements were terminated or could not be renewed, it may be forced to remove network facilities from the affected areas, relocate, or abandon networks, which would interrupt operations and force ALLO to find alternative rights-of-way, and make unexpected capital expenditures.\nIf ALLO cannot successfully manage construction risks and uncertainties, the expansion of its communications networks may not be achieved within acceptable cost parameters or result in desired levels of market share.\nThe success of our investment in ALLO depends on the ability of ALLO to successfully execute its current efforts and plans to construct expanded fiber communications networks to make its services available to additional homes and businesses. The construction of communications networks is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties related to the determination of the precise locations of easements and other rights-of-way necessary to construct and operate the networks, and the management of such construction in a manner that reasonably minimizes the disruption to other private property owners, including minimizing any unintended damage to property or equipment owned or utilized by private parties. If ALLO is not successful in managing these and similar construction risks, it could experience higher than expected costs and reputational damage that adversely impacts market share and future revenues, and the currently expected benefits from its expansion efforts and plans may not be realized.\nALLO may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact relating to occupational, health, and safety matters or failure to comply with safety or environmental laws.\nAerial and underground construction of new networks and service requires employees and contractors to work in the proximity of gas, electric, water, sewer, and other competitors\u2019 utility services, and ALLO's operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace. While ALLO has invested, and will continue to invest, substantial resources in its robust occupational, health, and safety programs, ALLO's business involves a high degree of operational risk, and there can be no assurance that it will avoid significant exposure. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and other consequential damages and could lead to suspension of operations, large damage claims and, in extreme cases, criminal liability. ALLO could also be subject to potential liabilities in the event it causes a release of hazardous substances or other environmental damage resulting from underground objects it encounters. Environmental laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Costs associated with the discharge of hazardous substances may include clean-up costs and related damages or liabilities. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect ALLO's results of operations and cash flows.\nIndustry changes and competitive pressures may harm revenues and profit margins, including future revenues and profit margins of our communications business through ALLO.\nWe face aggressive price competition for our products and services and, as a result, we may have to lower our product and service prices to stay competitive, while at the same time, expand market share and maintain profit margins. Even if we maintain or increase market share for a product or service, revenue or profit margins could decline because the product or service is in a maturing market or market conditions have changed due to economic, political, or regulatory pressures.\nThe internet, television, and telecommunications businesses are highly competitive. For a discussion of the competitive factors faced by ALLO, see Part I, Item I, \"Communications - Competition.\" ALLO may not be able to successfully anticipate and respond to many of these various competitive factors affecting the industry, including regulatory changes that may affect competitors and ALLO differently, new technologies, services, and applications that may be introduced, and changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends, and discount or bundled pricing strategies by competitors which are larger and have more resources than ALLO. If ALLO does not compete effectively, it could lose customers, revenue, and market share; customers may reduce their usage of ALLO's services or switch to a less profitable service; and ALLO may need to lower prices or increase marketing efforts to remain competitive.\nOur enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating all risks.\nOur enterprise risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss. Our established framework includes policies, processes, personnel, and control systems to identify, measure, monitor, control, and report risks. This framework is designed to\nmitigate and appropriately balance risk exposure with the Company\u2019s strategic objectives and desired returns. However, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not anticipated, identified, or mitigated. If our enterprise risk management framework does not effectively identify and manage these risks, we could suffer litigation and negative regulatory consequences, unexpected losses, and our results of operations, cash flow, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRegulatory and Legal\nFederal and state laws and regulations can restrict our businesses and result in increased compliance expenses, and noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in penalties, litigation, reputation damage, and a loss of customers.\nOur operating segments are heavily regulated by federal and state government regulatory agencies. See Part I, Item 1, \"Regulation and Supervision.\" The laws and regulations enforced by these agencies are proposed or enacted to protect consumers and the financial industry as a whole, not necessarily the Company, our operating segments, or our shareholders. We have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance with numerous federal and state laws and regulations. However, because these laws and regulations are complex, differ between jurisdictions, and are often subject to interpretation, or as a result of unintended errors, we may, from time to time, inadvertently be in non-compliance with these laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations is expensive and requires the time and attention of management. These costs divert capital and focus away from efforts intended to grow our business. If we do not successfully comply with laws, regulations, or policies, we could incur fines or penalties, lose existing or new customer contracts or other business, and suffer damage to our reputation. Changes in these laws and regulations can significantly alter our business environment, limit business operations, and increase costs of doing business, and we cannot predict the impact such changes would have on our profitability.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has the authority to supervise and examine large nonbank student loan servicers, including us. If in the course of such an examination the CFPB were to determine that we were not in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and CFPB guidance, it is possible that this could result in material adverse consequences, including, without limitation, settlements, fines, penalties, public enforcement action, adverse regulatory actions, changes in our business practices, or other actions. In 2015, the CFPB conducted a public inquiry into student loan servicing practices and issued a report recommending the creation of consistent, industry-wide standards for the entire servicing market. The CFPB has also announced that it may issue student loan servicing rules in the future.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding how the CFPB's recommendations, strategies, and priorities will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward. Actions by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter our services, causing them to be less attractive or effective and impair our ability to offer them profitably. In the event that the CFPB changes regulations adopted in the past by other regulators, or modifies past regulatory guidance, our compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase.\nSeveral states have enacted laws regulating and monitoring the activity of student loan servicers. Some of these laws stipulate additional licensing fees which increase our cost of doing business. Where we have obtained licenses, state licensing statutes may impose a variety of requirements and restrictions on us. In addition, these statutes may also subject us to the supervisory and examination authority of state regulators in certain cases, and we will be subject to and experience exams by state regulators. If we are found to not have complied with applicable laws, regulations, or requirements, we could: (i) lose one or more of our licenses or authorizations, (ii) become subject to a consent order or administrative enforcement action, (iii) face lawsuits (including class action lawsuits), sanctions, or penalties, or (iv) be in breach of certain contracts, which may void or cancel such contracts. We anticipate additional states adopting similar laws.\nAs a result of the Reconciliation Act of 2010, interest income on our existing FFELP loan portfolio, as well as revenue from FFELP servicing and FFELP loan servicing software licensing and consulting fees, will continue to decline over time as our and our third-party lender clients' FFELP loan portfolios are paid down and FFELP clients exit the market.\nThe Reconciliation Act of 2010 discontinued new loan originations under the FFEL Program effective July 1, 2010, and requires that all new federal loan originations be made through the Federal Direct Loan Program. Although the law did not alter or affect the terms and conditions of existing FFELP loans, interest income and revenue streams related to existing FFELP loans will continue to decline over time as existing FFELP loans are paid down, refinanced, or repaid by guaranty agencies after default.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recognized approximately $206 million, $230 million, and $290 million, respectively, of net interest income on our FFELP loan portfolio, and approximately $25 million, $32 million, and $16 million, respectively, in guaranty and third-party FFELP servicing revenue. In addition, the Company recognized\napproximately $5 million in each of the last three years in FFELP loan servicing software licensing and consulting fees related to the FFEL Program. The 2018 increase in FFELP servicing revenue was due to the acquisition of Great Lakes, and these amounts will otherwise continue to decline over time as our and our third-party lender clients' FFELP loan portfolios are paid down and FFELP clients exit the market.\nIf we are unable to grow or develop new revenue streams, our consolidated revenue and operating margin will decrease as a result of the decline in FFELP loan volume outstanding.\nExposure related to certain tax issues could decrease our net income.\nFederal and state income tax laws and regulations are often complex and require interpretation. From time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We prepare and file tax returns based on the interpretation of tax laws and regulations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we establish reserves for tax contingencies related to deductions and credits that we may be unable to sustain. Differences between the reserves for tax contingencies and the amounts ultimately owed are recorded in the period they become known. Adjustments to our reserves could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nWe may also be impacted by changes in tax laws, including tax rate changes, new tax laws, and subsequent interpretations of tax laws by federal and state tax authorities.\nIn addition to corporate tax matters, as both a lender and servicer of student loans, we are required to report student loan interest received and cancellation of indebtedness to individuals and the Internal Revenue Service on an annual basis. These informational forms assist individuals in complying with their federal and state income tax obligations. The statutory and regulatory guidance regarding the calculations, recipients, and timing are complex and we know that interpretations of these rules vary across the industry. The complexity and volume associated with these informational forms creates a risk of error which could result in penalties or damage to our reputation.\nThe Company invests in certain tax-advantaged projects promoting renewable energy resources (solar projects). The Company\u2019s investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal income tax credits, operating cash flows, and other tax benefits, over specified time periods. The Company\u2019s investments in these projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. The Company is subject to the risk that tax credits recorded currently and previously, which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level, will fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and will not be able to be realized. The possible inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. The risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside of the Company\u2019s control, including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to continue operation.\nPrincipal Shareholder and Related Party Transactions\nOur Executive Chairman beneficially owns 81.9 percent of the voting rights of our shareholders and effectively has control over all matters at our Company.\nMichael S. Dunlap, our Executive Chairman and a principal shareholder, beneficially owns 81.9 percent of the voting rights of our shareholders. Accordingly, each member of the Board of Directors and each member of management has been elected or effectively appointed by Mr. Dunlap and can be removed by Mr. Dunlap. As a result, Mr. Dunlap, as Executive Chairman and controlling shareholder, has control over all matters at our Company and has the ability to take actions that benefit him, but may not benefit other minority shareholders, and may otherwise exercise his control in a manner with which other minority shareholders may not agree or which they may not consider to be in their best interests.\nOur contractual arrangements and transactions with Union Bank and Trust Company (\"Union Bank\"), which is under common control with us, present conflicts of interest and pose risks to our shareholders that the terms may not be as favorable to us as we could receive from unrelated third parties.\nUnion Bank is controlled by Farmers & Merchants Investment Inc. (\"F&M\"), which owns 81.4 percent of Union Bank's common stock and 15.4 percent of Union Bank's non-voting non-convertible preferred stock. Mr. Dunlap, a significant shareholder, as well as Executive Chairman, and a member of our Board of Directors, along with his spouse and children, owns or controls a total of 33.0 percent of the stock of F&M, including a total of 48.6 percent of the outstanding voting common stock of F&M, and Mr. Dunlap's sister, Angela L. Muhleisen, along with her spouse and children, owns or controls a total of\n31.7 percent of F&M stock, including a total of 47.5 percent of the outstanding voting common stock of F&M. Mr. Dunlap serves as a Director and Chairman of F&M, and as a Director of Union Bank. Ms. Muhleisen serves as a Director and Chief Executive Officer of F&M and as a Director, Chairperson, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Union Bank. Union Bank is deemed to have beneficial ownership of a significant number of shares of Nelnet because it serves in a capacity of trustee or account manager for various trusts and accounts holding shares of Nelnet, and may share voting and/or investment power with respect to such shares. As of December 31, 2019, Union Bank was deemed to beneficially own 10.0 percent of the voting rights of our outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2019, Mr. Dunlap and Ms. Muhleisen beneficially owned 81.9 percent and 12.0 percent, respectively, of the voting rights of our outstanding common stock (with certain shares deemed under applicable SEC rules to be beneficially owned by both Mr. Dunlap and Ms. Muhleisen).\nWe have entered into certain contractual arrangements with Union Bank, including loan purchases, loan servicing, loan participations, banking and lending services, 529 Plan administration services, lease arrangements, trustee services, and various other investment and advisory services. The net aggregate impact on our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 related to the transactions with Union Bank was income (before income taxes) of $9.7 million, $9.2 million, and $12.5 million, respectively. See note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information related to the transactions between us and Union Bank.\nTransactions between Union Bank and us are generally based on available market information for comparable assets, products, and services and are extensively negotiated. In addition, all related party transactions between Union Bank and us are approved by both the Union Bank Board of Directors and our Board of Directors. Furthermore, Union Bank is subject to regulatory oversight and review by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the State of Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance. The FDIC and the State of Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance regularly review Union Bank's transactions with affiliates. The regulatory standard applied to the bank falls under Regulation W, which places restrictions on certain \u201ccovered\u201d transactions with affiliates.\nWe intend to maintain our relationship with Union Bank, which our management believes provides certain benefits to us. Those benefits include Union Bank's knowledge of and experience in the FFELP industry, its willingness to provide services, and at times liquidity and capital resources, on an expedient basis, and the proximity of Union Bank to our corporate headquarters located in Lincoln, Nebraska.\nThe majority of the transactions and arrangements with Union Bank are not offered to unrelated third parties or subject to competitive bids. Accordingly, these transactions and arrangements not only present conflicts of interest, but also pose the risk to our shareholders that the terms of such transactions and arrangements may not be as favorable to us as we could receive from unrelated third parties. Moreover, we may have and/or may enter into contracts and business transactions with related parties that benefit Mr. Dunlap and his sister, as well as other related parties, that may not benefit us and/or our minority shareholders.", "PERMNO": 89964, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "NNI"}
