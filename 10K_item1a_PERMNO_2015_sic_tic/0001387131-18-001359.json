All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information in this report before trading our securities.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully with other entities that operate in our industry.\nWe experience a great deal of competition in locating land to develop and properties to acquire.\nIn our effort to sell or acquire land or other properties, we compete with a broad spectrum of other entities in each of our markets. These competitors include, among others, publicly held REITs, privately held entities and individual property owners. Some of these competitors may be able to offer more attractive financial terms than we are able to offer.\nIf the availability of land or high quality properties in our markets diminishes, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe may experience increased operating costs, which could adversely affect our financial results and the value of our properties.\nReal estate properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as insurance, administrative costs, real estate taxes and other costs associated with the ownership and maintenance of our properties. Our ability to make distributions to shareholders or to service indebtedness could be adversely affected by increased costs.\nWe face risks associated with property ownership and acquisitions.\nWe have acquired individual properties and portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so. Our acquisition activities and their successes are subject to the following risks:\n\u25cf\nwhen we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;\n\u25cf\nacquired properties may fail to perform as expected;\n\u25cf\nthe actual costs of repositioning, developing or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than original estimates;\n\u25cf\nacquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into existing operations, and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we may be required to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.\nOur land holdings are concentrated in our primary markets, and we therefore may suffer economic harm as a result of adverse conditions in those markets.\nOur land holdings are located principally in a specific geographic area in Farmers Branch, Texas. Due to the concentration of our properties in this area, performance is dependent on economic conditions. This area has experienced periods of economic decline in the past, and may do so in the future.\nWe may not be able to access financial markets to obtain capital on a timely basis, or on acceptable terms.\nWe rely on proceeds from property dispositions and third party capital sources for a portion of our capital needs, including capital for acquisitions and development. The public debt and equity markets are among the sources on which we rely. There is no guarantee that we will be able to access these markets, or any other source of capital. The ability to access the public debt and equity markets depends on a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions affecting these markets;\n\u25cf\nour own financial structure and performance;\n\u25cf\nthe market\u2019s opinion of real estate companies in general; and\n\u25cf\nthe market\u2019s opinion of real estate companies that own properties like ours.\nOur degree of reliance on the operations of certain real estate assets to collect the notes receivable can affect our cash flow.\nThe collection of our notes receivable are dependent upon the ability of the real estate assets that secure the notes to produce sufficient cash flow to service these notes. Changes in general or local economic conditions in the Dallas, Texas area can have an adverse effect on the payment of these notes.\nOur degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe degree of leverage available to the Company could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. The degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt.\nWe may incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which would adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance any existing debt when it matures.\nWe may need to sell assets from time to time for cash flow purposes.\nBecause of the lack of liquidity of real estate investments generally, our ability to respond to changing circumstances may be impaired. Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. In the event that we must sell assets to generate cash flow, we cannot predict whether there will be a market for those assets in the time period we desire or need to sell them, or whether we will be able to sell them at a price that will allow us to fully recoup our investment. We may not be able to realize the full potential value of our assets and we may incur costs related to the early pay-off of the debt secured by such assets. In addition, to the extent that the Company provides financing to the buyer, our ability to collect the amounts owed when due may adversely affect our cash flow.\nThe overall business is subject to all of the risks associated with the real estate industry.\nWe are subject to all risks incident to investment in real estate, many of which relate to the general lack of liquidity of real estate investments, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nchanges in general or local economic conditions-because our real estate assets are concentrated in Farmers Branch, Texas, any deterioration in the general economic conditions in the Dallas, Texas area could have an adverse effect on our business and assets;\n\u25cf\nchanges in interest rates that may make our ability to satisfy our debt service requirements materially more burdensome;\n\u25cf\nlack of availability of financing that may render the purchase, sale or refinancing of a property more difficult or unattractive;\n\u25cf\nchanges in real estate and zoning laws;\n\u25cf\nincreases in real estate taxes and insurance costs;\n\u25cf\nfederal or local economic or rent control; and\n\u25cf\nhurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other similar natural disasters.\nAdverse economic conditions and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, and financial condition.\nOur business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole or by the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located, including the current dislocations in the credit markets and general global economic recession. These current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition as a result of the following, among other, potential consequences:\n\u25cf\nour ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense;\n\u25cf\nreduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans; and\n\u25cf\none or more lenders could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all.\nReal estate investments are illiquid, and we may not be able to sell properties if and when it is appropriate to do so.\nReal estate generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to dispose of properties promptly in response to economic or other conditions. In addition, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to sell properties (without incurring significant tax costs) in some situations when it may be otherwise economically advantageous to do so, thereby adversely affecting returns to stockholders and adversely impacting our ability to meet our obligations.", "PERMNO": 75069, "SIC": 6162, "TIC": "IOR"}
