{"cik": "1040719", "company": "WALTER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully review and consider the risks and uncertainties described below, which are risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity, results of operations, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and/or our stock price. In addition, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking information, the risk factors set forth below are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results for various financial reporting periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on our behalf.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk\nIf we fail to operate our business in compliance with both existing and future requirements, our business, financial condition, liquidity and/or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental and regulatory authorities, including the CFPB, the FTC, HUD, the SEC and various state agencies that license, audit, investigate and conduct examinations of our mortgage servicing, origination, insurance, collection, reverse and other activities. Further, in recent years the policies, laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business have been rapidly evolving. We are unable to predict whether federal, state or local governmental authorities will enact laws, rules or regulations that will result in changes in our practices in the future and whether any such changes could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, the GSEs, Ginnie Mae and other business counterparties also subject us to periodic reviews and audits, and we routinely conduct our own internal reviews and audits. These various audits, reviews and examinations of our business and related activities sometimes uncover deficiencies in our compliance with our policies and other requirements to which we are subject. While we strive to investigate and remediate such deficiencies, there can be no assurance that any remedial measures we implement will ensure compliance with applicable policies, laws and regulations or be deemed sufficient by the GSEs, governmental authorities or other interested parties.\nWe devote substantial resources (including senior management time and attention) to regulatory compliance and regulatory inquiries, and we incur, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs in connection therewith. Our business, financial condition, liquidity and/or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the substantial resources (including senior management time and attention) we devote to, and the significant compliance costs we incur in connection with, compliance and regulatory inquiries, and any fines, penalties, restitution or similar payments we make in connection with resolving such matters.\nFurthermore, our actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations and GSE, Ginnie Mae and other business counterparty requirements, or to implement and adhere to adequate remedial measures designed to address any identified compliance deficiencies, could lead to:\n\u2022\nthe loss of licenses and approvals necessary to operate our business;\n\u2022\nlimitations or complete bans on our business;\n\u2022\ndisqualification from participation in governmental programs, including GSE programs;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u2022\ngovernmental investigations and enforcement actions;\n\u2022\nadministrative fines and penalties;\n\u2022\nlitigation, including class action lawsuits;\n\u2022\ncivil and criminal liability;\n\u2022\ntermination of our servicing and sub-servicing agreements;\n\u2022\nloss of personnel who are targeted by prosecutions, investigations, enforcement actions or litigation;\n\u2022\na significant increase in compliance costs;\n\u2022\na significant increase in the resources (including senior management time and attention) we devote to regulatory compliance and regulatory inquiries;\n\u2022\nan inability to access new, or a loss of current, liquidity and funding sources necessary to operate our business;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on mergers and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nimpairment of assets;\n\u2022\nconservatorship or receivership by order of a court or regulator; and\n\u2022\nan inability to execute on our business strategy.\nAny of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, business prospects, financial condition, prospects, liquidity and/or results of operations.\nThe mortgage servicing industry has been and remains under increased scrutiny from state and federal regulators and other authorities, with particular attention directed at larger non-bank servicing organizations that have experienced recent and rapid growth such as Walter. We cannot guarantee that any such scrutiny and investigations will not materially adversely affect us.\nOur failure to comply with existing and future rules and regulations relating to the origination and servicing of residential loans, and/or more stringent enforcement of such rules and regulations by the CFPB, HUD and other federal agencies could result in enforcement actions, fines, penalties and reputational damage.\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law for the express purpose of further regulating the financial services industry, including mortgage origination, sales, servicing and securitization. The CFPB, a federal agency established pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, officially began operation on July 21, 2011. The CFPB is charged, in part, with enforcing laws involving consumer financial products and services, including mortgage finance and servicing and reverse mortgages, and is empowered with examination,\nenforcement and rulemaking authority. While the full scope of the CFPB\u2019s rulemaking and regulatory agenda relating to the mortgage servicing and origination industry is unclear and evolving, it is apparent that the CFPB has taken a very active role.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established new standards and practices for mortgage originators and servicers, including determining prospective borrower\u2019s abilities to repay their mortgages, removing incentives for higher cost mortgages, prohibiting prepayment penalties for non-qualified mortgages, prohibiting mandatory arbitration clauses, requiring additional disclosures to potential borrowers and restricting the fees that mortgage originators may collect. Final regulations regarding such \u201cability to repay\u201d and other mortgage originating and servicing rules, standards and practices were adopted by the CFPB and took effect in January 2014.\nWe are an approved non-supervised FHA mortgagee. Recently, HUD and the U.S. Department of Justice have pursued actions against FHA-approved lenders under the False Claims Act, which imposes liability on any person who knowingly makes a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Potential penalties are significant and several large settlements have been entered into by FHA lenders who have allegedly violated the False Claims Act. See Item 3. \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information.\nRegulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act or by the CFPB and actions by the CFPB, HUD and other federal agencies could materially and adversely affect the manner in which we conduct our businesses, and could result in heightened federal regulation and oversight of our business activities and in increased costs and potential litigation associated with our business activities. See Item 3. \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information.\nOur business is highly dependent on U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, and any changes in these entities or their current roles could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.\nThe U.S. residential mortgage industry in general and our business in particular are highly dependent on the GSEs, particularly Fannie Mae, and Ginnie Mae. We receive compensation for servicing loans on behalf of the GSEs and Ginnie Mae. In addition, we sell mortgage loans to GSEs, which include mortgage loans in GSE guaranteed securitizations. We are also an approved non-supervised FHA mortgagee and an approved issuer of HMBS, which are guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and collateralized by participation interests in HECMs, which are insured by the FHA. We derive material benefits from our relationships with GSEs and Ginnie Mae, as our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans under their programs reduces our credit exposure and mortgage inventory financing costs. In 2014, we earned approximately 41% of our total revenues from servicing Fannie Mae residential loans and sold substantially all of the mortgage loans we originated to Fannie Mae.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including with respect to how long they will continue to be in existence, the extent of their roles in the market and what forms they will have. On September 7, 2008, the FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship. As the conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the FHFA controls and directs the operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. There are several pending bills and proposals to revamp both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be significantly reduced or eliminated and the nature of the guarantees could be considerably limited relative to historical practice. The elimination of the traditional roles of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or the FHA could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAny discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of these GSEs or agencies or any significant adverse change in the level of activity of these GSEs or agencies in the primary or secondary mortgage markets or in the underwriting criteria of these GSEs or agencies could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial position and results of operations. In addition, we would be materially adversely affected if our business relationship with Fannie Mae was to deteriorate in any significant respect.\nWe are subject to state licensing requirements and the related substantial compliance costs, and our business would be adversely affected if we lose our licenses.\nOur operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations. Although we are not a bank or bank holding company, in most states in which we operate a regulatory agency regulates and enforces laws relating to non-bank mortgage servicing companies and mortgage origination companies such as us. These rules and regulations generally provide for licensing as a mortgage servicing company, mortgage origination company, debt collection agency or third party default specialist, as applicable, requirements as to the form and content of contracts and other documentation, licensing of our employees and employee hiring background checks, licensing of independent contractors with whom we contract, restrictions on collection practices, disclosure and record-keeping requirements and enforcement of borrowers' rights. In certain states, we are subject to periodic examination by state regulatory authorities. Some states in which we operate require special licensing or provide extensive regulation of our business, and state regulators may have broad discretion to restrict our activities or to withdraw our licenses. The failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could result in a default under our servicing agreements and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nRegulatory changes could increase our costs through stricter licensing laws, disclosure laws or increased fees and could impose conditions to licensing that we or our personnel are unable to meet. Future state legislation and changes in regulation may significantly\nincrease the compliance costs on our operations or reduce the amount of ancillary fees, including late fees, that we may charge to borrowers. This could make our business cost-prohibitive in the affected state or states and could materially affect our business.\nLegal proceedings and related costs may increase and could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings, including numerous matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Like other participants in our industry, we have been and may continue to be the subject of class action and other lawsuits and regulatory actions by states' attorneys general and federal and state regulators. Litigation and other proceedings may require that we pay attorneys' fees, settlement costs, damages, penalties or other charges, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nGovernmental and regulatory investigations, both state and federal, have increased in all areas of our business. The costs of responding to the investigations can be substantial. In addition, government-mandated changes, resulting from investigations or otherwise, to our loan origination and servicing practices could lead to higher costs and additional administrative burdens, such as record retention and informational obligations.\nIn February 2015, we informed the FTC and CFPB that we would agree to the terms of a proposed stipulated order that, subject to approval by the FTC, the CFPB and the court, would settle the matters arising from an FTC and CFPB investigation relating to Green Tree Servicing's servicing practices. If FTC and CFPB approval is obtained, the agencies will file a complaint in federal district court and seek court approval of the proposed order. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, Green Tree Servicing will pay a fine and restitution, the full amounts of which have been accrued in the Company\u2019s financial statements as of December 31, 2014. In addition, under the proposed settlement Green Tree Servicing will also agree to injunctions relating to its mortgage servicing and collection practices and other matters, including injunctions against future violations of certain consumer protection statutes and regulations. The proposed order provides that, for purposes of the proposed settlement, Green Tree Servicing will not admit or deny the allegations in the related complaint. We cannot provide any assurance that the proposed settlement will be approved by the FTC, the CFPB and the court. If such approvals are not obtained, we could face renewed settlement negotiations or legal proceedings. Any allegations made against us by the FTC and/or CFPB and the commencement, settlement or other resolution of any FTC and/or CFPB action against us could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, business practices, prospects, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nSee Item 3. \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information regarding legal proceedings.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations.\nWe have substantial levels of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $5.0 billion of total indebtedness outstanding, the majority of which was secured, including:\n\u2022\n$1.5 billion of indebtedness under our 2013 Term Loan;\n\u2022\n$575 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes;\n\u2022\n$290 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes;\n\u2022\n$1.4 billion, in aggregate, of indebtedness under various servicing advance facilities and the Early Advance Reimbursement Agreement; and\n\u2022\n$1.2 billion, in aggregate, of indebtedness under various master repurchase agreements.\nAll of these amounts of indebtedness exclude (i) intercompany indebtedness, (ii) guarantees of affiliate debt and (iii) mortgage-backed and asset-backed notes, which are non-recourse to us and our subsidiaries.\nOur high level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in general economic, industry or competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our unhedged obligations are at a variable rate of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product or service line development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower debt levels.\nWe and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including our 2013 Secured Credit Facilities and the Senior Notes Indenture. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet all of our obligations or service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make required payments on our debt and other obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control, including the risk factors as set forth herein. We cannot assure you we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness or to meet our other obligations such as our mandatory clean-up call obligations related to our Non-Residual Trusts.\nIn addition, we conduct a substantial part of our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is also dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness.\nWe may find it prudent or necessary to refinance our existing indebtedness. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected by global economic and financial conditions. In addition, optional prepayment of certain of our existing indebtedness is subject to the payment of prepayment premiums. In addition, our ability to incur secured indebtedness (which would generally enable us to achieve better pricing than the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness) depends in part on the value of our assets, which depends, in turn, on the strength of our cash flows and results of operations, and on economic and market conditions and other factors.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service and other obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service and other obligations then due.\nDespite our current debt levels, we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above.\nDespite our current consolidated debt levels, we and our subsidiaries are permitted to and may incur substantial additional debt in the future (including in connection with additional acquisitions), some of which may be secured, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments. In addition, our 2013 Revolver provides for $125 million of borrowings, subject to customary borrowing conditions. Although the 2013 Secured Credit Facilities and the Senior Notes Indenture contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Any such indebtedness could increase our leverage and the risks we face from indebtedness. We may also be permitted to take a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due.\nOur mortgage servicing business involves significant operational risks.\nWe have grown our mortgage servicing business rapidly over the past several years. Our mortgage servicing business involves complex record-keeping, the handling of millions of payments each month and a significant amount of consumer contact, all of which are subject to detailed, prescriptive regulation and client requirements, and performing these tasks in a compliant, timely and profitable manner involves significant operational risk. Other mortgage servicers have suffered operational deficiencies due to the operational risks associated with servicing mortgages and/or a rapid expansion. If we were to experience operational deficiencies this\ncould adversely affect our results of operations and could also lead to potential violations of governmental regulations followed by enforcement penalties and fines.\nWe acquire rights to service mortgages on a regular basis. When we acquire the rights to service mortgages, particularly GSE mortgages, we may incur liability that is the result of errors or violations of law attributable to prior originators and servicers of such mortgages to the extent applicable law or our contractual arrangements expose us to such liability, which is normally the case absent additional contractual arrangements that are negotiated on a transaction by transaction basis. We typically seek and, in certain circumstances, obtain, contractual arrangements meant to minimize our exposure to such liabilities. Such contractual arrangements can take the form of, for example, liability bifurcation agreements pursuant to which such liabilities are not assumed by us, or an indemnification pursuant to which we are indemnified for such liabilities by the former owners of the MSRs. There is no assurance that any such indemnification, even if obtainable, enforceable and collectible, will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities arising from a particular acquisition. Furthermore, there is no assurance that any such indemnification will cover losses resulting from claims that may be asserted against us by a GSE with respect to errors or violations that occurred prior to a particular acquisition by us.\nThe owners of loans we service or sub-service may, under certain circumstances, transfer our servicing rights or sub-servicing or otherwise terminate our servicing rights or sub-servicing contracts.\nUnder the terms of our master servicing agreements (including any amendments and addendums thereto) with GSEs and other clients, our clients have the right to terminate us as the servicer of the loans we service on their behalf if we default pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable servicing agreement. In addition, under certain of our agreements, the servicing on some or all of the loans can be transferred by our client, either with or without cause, and in certain of these instances without the receipt by us of consideration for the transferred servicing rights. Our master servicing agreements with GSEs also require that we service in accordance with GSE servicing guidelines. Failure to comply with servicing standards and to maintain certain tangible net worth levels could result in termination of our agreements with GSEs. For example, under our mortgage selling and servicing contract (including the amendments and addendums thereto) with Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae has the ability to terminate such contract (i) without cause, subject to payment of an agreed-upon termination fee or (ii) with cause, in which case Fannie Mae would not be obligated to pay us a termination fee. Events that could allow Fannie Mae to terminate such contract for cause include, without limitation, a breach of the mortgage selling and servicing contract by us, our failure to comply with certain servicing guidelines, or a change in our financial status that, in Fannie Mae\u2019s opinion, materially and adversely affects our ability to satisfactorily service mortgages.\nUnder our sub-servicing contracts (including any amendments and addendums thereto), the primary servicers for whom we conduct sub-servicing activities have the right to terminate our sub-servicing rights with or without cause, with generally 60 to 90 days\u2019 notice to us. In some instances, the sub-servicing contracts require payment to us of a deboarding fee upon transfer, while in other instances there is little to no consideration paid to us in connection with any transfer or other termination of sub-servicing rights. We expect to continue to seek additional sub-servicing opportunities under terms and conditions which could exacerbate these risks.\nIf we were to have our servicing or sub-servicing rights transferred or otherwise terminated on a material portion of our servicing portfolio, this could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe are required to service some of our mortgage loans in accordance with the National Mortgage Settlement standards, and our failure to meet those standards has harmed, and may continue to harm, our reputation and business.\nIn connection with our purchase of Fannie Mae MSRs from ResCap on January 31, 2013, we agreed to service the mortgage loans for which the MSRs were acquired in accordance with the servicing standards set forth in a Consent Judgment, the National Mortgage Settlement, filed on April 4, 2012 in a legal proceeding involving ResCap as a party. During initial testing of our adherence to these servicing standards in the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2013, we determined that we had exceeded threshold error rates for certain servicing metrics. We reported our findings to the Monitor, who was appointed under the Consent Judgment and charged with responsibility to determine whether the servicers subject to the NMS are complying with the standards and satisfying the requirements of the Consent Judgment. On May 14, 2014, the Monitor filed a report with the applicable court, stating that we had potential violations in respect of eight of the 28 metrics tested (including two relating to bankruptcy filings, two relating to pre-foreclosure matters, and one relating to each of the following: waived fees; vendor management; complaints; and loan modifications). We later submitted to the Monitor corrective action plans designed to address and cure the root causes of the failed metrics and to prevent future recurrences. Those plans were approved by the Monitor and retesting of the eight metrics took place in the calendar quarter ended September 30, 2014. In approving the corrective action plans, the Monitor reached the conclusion that three of our potential violations were widespread, and in accordance with the NMS procedures we submitted for the Monitor\u2019s review remediation plans for all borrowers affected by the potential violations. The remediation plans were approved by the Monitor, implemented by us, and are subject to Monitor testing. On December 16, 2014, the Monitor filed a report with the applicable court, stating that we had passed all metrics tested in the calendar quarter ended March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014. Although we are devoting considerable resources to ensuring that in subsequent testing periods we will be found to have met the NMS requirements, there is no assurance that our\ncorrective action plans will be successful and that we will meet all other NMS requirements. In addition, if in the future we were to fail a servicing metric in two consecutive tests, we may be obligated to indemnify ResCap in the event ResCap is fined or penalized as a result of our conduct. In addition, one of our other clients requires us to follow most of these servicing standards when we sub-service loans for it, and we expect to sub-service such loans under the NMS standards at least until October 2015, when the term of the NMS Consent Judgment expires.\nWe are required to make servicing advances that can be subject to delays in recovery or may not be recoverable in certain circumstances.\nDuring any period in which a borrower is not making payments, we are required under some of our mortgage servicing agreements to advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest remittance requirements for credit owners. In addition, we must pay property taxes, insurance premiums, legal expenses and make other protective advances on behalf of the borrower. We also advance funds to maintain, repair and market real estate properties on behalf of credit owners. Our obligation to make such advances may increase in connection with any future acquisitions of servicing portfolios. In certain situations, our contractual obligations may require us to make certain advances for which we may not be reimbursed.\nServicing advances are generally recovered when a mortgage loan delinquency is resolved, the loan is repaid or refinanced, a liquidation occurs, or through the agency claim process. Regulatory actions that lengthen the foreclosure process may increase the amount of servicing advances we are required to make, lengthen the time it takes for us to be reimbursed for such advances and increase the costs incurred by us in connection with such advances. In certain circumstances we may be unable to collect reimbursement for advances if we do not seek reimbursement in a timely manner or have the proper documentation supporting the advance. A delay in our ability to collect advances could adversely affect our liquidity, and our inability to be reimbursed for advances would adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur failure to renew one or more of our advance financing facilities or warehouse facilities, or any loss of a material amount of borrowing capacity under such facilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe have several financing facilities that we depend upon to finance, on a short-term basis, certain of our servicer advances and residential loan origination activities. Each of these facilities is typically subject to renewal every year and contains provisions that in certain circumstances could prevent us from utilizing any unused capacity under such facility and/or that could accelerate our repayment of amounts outstanding under such facility. Only servicing advances and residential loans that meet certain eligibility requirements as defined in the relevant financing facility agreements are eligible to be financed using such facilities. One of our advance financing facilities requires us to maintain certain agreements with the GSEs, and if one or both of these GSE agreements were terminated it would limit or eliminate our ability to fund advances using this financing facility. In addition, amounts borrowed under our principal advance facility are due on a fixed date (unless extended), and we may be required to repay such amounts before we have been reimbursed for the related advances.\nOur failure to renew one or more of these financing facilities on terms acceptable to us, the acceleration of amounts due under such facilities or our loss of a material amount of borrowing capacity under such facilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur failure to maintain or grow our servicing business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur servicing portfolio is subject to \"run-off,\" meaning that mortgage loans serviced by us may be repaid at maturity, prepaid prior to maturity, or liquidated through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or other liquidation process. While we seek to replenish our servicing portfolio through the addition of sub-servicing contracts and through MSR originations and acquisitions, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining the size of our servicing portfolio.\nOur ability to maintain or grow our servicing business depends, in part, on our ability to acquire servicing rights from third parties. This depends on many factors, including the willingness and ability of the current owners of servicing rights to transfer such servicing rights, and in most cases GSEs and/or government authorities granting consent for such transfers. In part because of consumer complaints about problems arising from servicing transfers, regulatory scrutiny over, and interference with, such transfers has increased. We do not have any control over the scope and/or timing of the current owners\u2019 efforts to transfer servicing.\nThere is significant competition in the non-bank servicing sector for servicing rights made available for purchase, and the supply of such portfolios may decline as the opportunity created by the financial crisis ebbs. These and other factors could increase the prices we may need to pay for such portfolios or reduce sub-servicing margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In determining the purchase price we are willing to pay for both servicing rights and sub-\nservicing, management makes certain assumptions regarding various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among other things:\n\u2022\norigination vintage and geography;\n\u2022\nloan to value ratio;\n\u2022\nstratification of FICO scores;\n\u2022\nthe rates of prepayment and repayment within the underlying pools of mortgage loans;\n\u2022\nprojected rates of delinquencies, defaults and liquidations;\n\u2022\nfuture interest rates;\n\u2022\nour cost to service the loans;\n\u2022\nincentive and ancillary fee income; and\n\u2022\namounts of future servicing advances.\nThe methodology used to determine the purchase price we are willing to pay for both servicing rights and sub-servicing is highly complex and depends upon the reasonableness of management\u2019s assumptions. As a result, we may not be successful in completing acquisitions on favorable terms or at all or we may overpay or not realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions in our business development pipeline.\nChanges in prepayment rates on loans we service due to changes in interest rates, government mortgage programs or other factors could result in reduced earnings or losses.\nChanges in prepayment rates on loans we service could result in reduced earnings or losses. Many factors beyond our control affect prepayment rates, including changes in interest rates and government mortgage programs. Many borrowers can prepay their mortgage loans through refinancings when mortgage rates decrease. Any increase in prepayments could reduce our servicing portfolio and have a significant impact on our servicing fee revenues, our expenses and on the valuation of our MSRs as follows:\n\u2022\nRevenue. If prepayment speeds increase, our servicing fees will decline more rapidly than anticipated because of the greater than expected decrease in the number of loans or unpaid balance on which those fees are based. The reduction in servicing fees would be somewhat offset by increased float earnings because the faster repayment of loans will result in higher balances in the custodial accounts that generate the float earnings. Conversely, decreases in prepayment speeds drive increased servicing fees and lead to lower float balances and float earnings.\n\u2022\nExpenses. Amortization of MSRs is a significant operating expense. Since we amortize servicing rights in proportion to total expected income over the life of a portfolio, an increase in prepayment speeds leads to increased amortization expense as we revise downward our estimate of total expected income. Faster prepayment speeds will also result in higher compensating interest expense. Decreases in prepayment speeds lead to decreased amortization expense as the period over which we amortize MSRs is extended. Slower prepayment speeds also lead to lower compensating interest expense.\n\u2022\nValuation of MSRs. We base the price we pay for MSRs and the rate of amortization of those rights on, among other things, our projection of the cash flows from the related pool of mortgage loans. Our expectation of prepayment speeds is a significant assumption underlying those cash flow projections. If prepayment speeds were significantly greater than expected, the carrying value of our MSRs could exceed their estimated fair value. When the carrying value of MSRs exceeds their fair value, we are required to record an impairment charge which has a negative impact on our financial results.\nA downgrade in our servicer ratings could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nStandard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch rate us as a residential loan servicer. Our current ratings from the rating agencies are important to the conduct of our loan servicing business. These ratings may be downgraded in the future. Any such downgrade could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as our ability to finance servicing advances and maintain our status as an approved servicer by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Certain of our servicing agreements require that we maintain specified servicer ratings. Our failure to maintain favorable or specified ratings may cause our termination as servicer and further impair our ability to consummate future servicing transactions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAn increase in delinquency rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nDelinquency rates can have a significant impact on our revenues and expenses and the value of our MSRs. For example, an increase in delinquencies may result in lower revenues because, for some GSE and other business, we may only collect servicing fees for performing loans. Additionally, while increased delinquencies may generate higher ancillary fees, including late fees, these fees are not likely to be recoverable in the event that the related loan is liquidated. In addition, an increase in delinquencies lowers the interest income we receive on cash held in collection and other accounts. Delinquencies can also increase our liability for servicing advances, as we may be required to advance certain payments early in a delinquency which could impact our liquidity. An increase in delinquencies will result in a higher cost to service due to the increased time and effort required to collect payments from delinquent borrowers. If we acquire portfolios of MSRs, the price we pay will depend on, among other things, our projections of the cash flows from the related pool of mortgage loans. Our expectation of delinquencies is a significant assumption underlying those cash flow projections. If delinquencies were significantly greater than expected, the estimated fair value of MSRs we acquire could be diminished. If the estimated fair value of MSRs is reduced, we could suffer a loss, which would have a negative impact on our financial results and the benefits we would get from acquisitions of MSRs.\nThe enforcement of consent orders by certain federal banking agencies against the largest servicers related to foreclosure practices could impose additional compliance costs on our servicing business.\nOn April 13, 2011, the federal banking agencies overseeing certain aspects of the mortgage market entered into consent orders with 14 of the largest mortgage servicers in the United States regarding foreclosure practices. The enforcement actions require the servicers, among other things, to: (i) correct deficiencies in residential loan servicing and foreclosure practices; (ii) make significant modifications in practices for residential loan servicing and foreclosure processing, including communications with borrowers and limitations on dual-tracking, which occurs when servicers continue to pursue foreclosure during the loan modification process; (iii) ensure that foreclosures are not pursued once a residential loan has been approved for modification and to establish a single point of contact for borrowers throughout the loan modification and foreclosure processes; and (iv) establish robust oversight and controls pertaining to their third-party vendors, including outside legal counsel, that provide default management or foreclosure services.\nOn February 28, 2013, the consent orders for 13 of the 14 servicers were amended to memorialize an agreement that had been reached in January 2013 with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board to provide more than $9.3 billion in payments and other assistance to borrowers, including $3.6 billion in cash payments and $5.7 billion in other assistance such as loan modifications and forgiveness of deficiency judgments.\nAlthough we are neither a direct party to these consent orders nor a banking organization, we have become subject to certain aspects of the consent orders to the extent: (i) we sub-service loans for the servicers that are parties to the consent orders; (ii) our clients require that we comply with certain aspects of the consent orders; or (iii) we otherwise find it prudent to comply with certain aspects of the consent orders. Further, certain laws, rules and regulations enacted or promulgated since the consent orders were entered into impose requirements on us that are similar to certain aspects of the consent orders. The settlement also adds requirements for loss mitigation programs, including restrictions on the imposition of force-placed lender insurance and other activities designed to keep borrowers in their homes. In addition, in connection with certain of our acquisitions, we agreed to certain monitoring of our servicing of these assets which is required under the consent orders. Changes to our servicing practices could increase compliance costs for our servicing business, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nLender-placed insurance is under increased scrutiny by regulators and, as a result of recent changes, income from commissions for the Green Tree insurance business has been reduced.\nUnder certain circumstances, when borrowers fail to provide hazard insurance on their residences, the owner or servicer of the loan may place such insurance to protect the collateral and passes on the premium to the borrower. Green Tree\u2019s insurance agency has acted as an agent for this purpose, placing the insurance coverage with a third-party carrier for which the agency earns a commission.\nEffective June 1, 2014, mortgage servicers and their affiliates may not receive commissions or other forms of compensation in connection with lender-placed insurance on GSE loans. Certain states have also imposed or proposed restrictions on the ability of mortgage servicers and their affiliates to receive commissions in connection with lender-placed insurance on mortgage loans relating to residential property located in the applicable state, and additional states may impose the same or similar restrictions in the future. Due to these and other recent regulatory developments surrounding lender-placed insurance policies, our sales commissions related to lender-placed insurance policies have decreased, and we could experience further restrictions on this business in the future.\nWe may be subject to liability for potential violations of predatory lending and/or servicing laws, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nVarious federal, state and local laws are designed to discourage predatory lending and servicing practices. HOEPA prohibits inclusion of certain provisions in residential loans that have mortgage rates, origination costs or prepayment penalties in excess of prescribed levels and requires that borrowers be given certain disclosures prior to origination. Some states have enacted, or may enact, similar laws or regulations, which in some cases impose restrictions and requirements greater than those in HOEPA. In addition, under the anti-predatory lending laws of some states, the origination of certain residential loans, including loans that are not classified as \"high cost\" loans under applicable law, must satisfy a net tangible benefits test with respect to the related borrower. This test may be highly subjective and open to interpretation. As a result, a court may determine that a residential loan, for example, does not meet the test even if the related originator reasonably believed that the test was satisfied. Failure of residential loan originators or servicers to comply with these laws, to the extent any of their residential loans are or become part of our mortgage-related assets, could subject us, as a servicer or as an assignee or purchaser, in the case of acquired loans, to monetary penalties and could result in the borrowers rescinding the affected residential loans. Lawsuits have been brought in various states making claims against originators, servicers, assignees and purchasers of high cost loans for violations of state law. Named defendants in these cases have included numerous participants within the secondary mortgage market. If our loans are found to have been originated in violation of predatory or abusive lending laws, we could incur losses, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nThe expiration of, or changes to, government mortgage modification, refinancing or other programs could adversely affect future revenues.\nUnder HAMP, HARP and similar government programs, a participating servicer may be entitled to receive financial incentives in connection with any mortgage refinancing or modification plans it enters into with eligible borrowers and subsequent success fees to the extent that a borrower remains current in any agreed upon loan modification. We participate in and have dedicated numerous resources to HAMP and HARP, benefiting from fees and from significant loan originations volumes. Changes in legislation or regulation regarding such programs that result in the modification of outstanding mortgage loans and changes in the requirements necessary to qualify for refinancing mortgage loans may impact the extent to which we participate in and receive financial benefits from such programs, or may increase the expense of our participation in such programs. We expect refinancing and modification volumes, revenues and margins to decline in 2015 as we believe peak HARP and HAMP refinancings and modifications already have occurred in 2013 and 2014. In addition, the HAMP and HARP programs are currently scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2015.\nWe cannot accurately predict the amount of incentive payments and ancillary fees we will earn on our servicing portfolio.\nWe earn incentive payments and ancillary fees in connection with servicing our residential loan portfolio. The amount of such payments and fees, and the timing of our receipt of such payments and fees, is dependent upon many factors, some of which are not in our control. For example, some of our servicing contracts contain periodic performance payments that are determined by formulas and/or are tied to the performance of our competitors. Inasmuch as we have little or no insight into the performance of our competitors, it is difficult, if not impossible in some instances, to predict with any certainty the amount of these incentive payments, if any. We also earn certain ancillary fees, such as, for example, late fees, the amount of which can vary significantly from period to period, in most instances due to circumstances over which we have no control. If certain of our assumptions relating to the amount of incentive payments or ancillary fees we expect to earn and collect in a given period prove to be materially inaccurate, or if regulators challenge the legitimacy of any of these fees, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to continue to grow our loan originations business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur mortgage originations business is conducted principally through our correspondent and retention channels, and we plan to develop our direct and retail channels significantly. Through our retention channel, we refinance or provide new loans to borrowers whose loans we service. The volume of originations in this channel has depended in large part upon the HARP program, which is scheduled to expire in 2015. As a result, we believe volumes in this channel may decline. Our correspondent channel grew significantly in 2014. We face intense competition and generally experience lower margins in this channel. We plan to expand our direct and retail channels in 2015, seeking to increase the volume of new purchase money mortgages we originate. While we intend to use sales lead aggregators, television and internet marketing to reach new borrowers, our retail originations channel may not succeed because of the referral-driven nature of our industry. The origination of purchase money mortgage loans is greatly influenced by traditional business clients in the home buying process such as realtors and builders. As a result, our ability to secure relationships with such traditional business clients will influence our ability to grow our purchase money mortgage loan volume and, thus, our loan originations business. If we are unable to develop our retail and direct channels successfully this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur mortgage originations business is highly dependent upon programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Failure to maintain our relationships with each of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to generate revenues in our mortgage originations business is highly dependent on programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and others that facilitate the issuance of mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market. Our status as a Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae approved seller/servicer is subject to compliance with each entity\u2019s respective selling and servicing guidelines and failure to meet such guidelines could result in the unilateral termination or suspension of our status as an approved seller/servicer.\nDuring 2014, substantially all of our originated mortgage loans were sold to, or were sold pursuant to programs sponsored by, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. We also derive other material financial benefits from our relationships with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, including the assumption of credit risk by these entities on loans included in mortgage-backed securities in exchange for our payment of guarantee fees. Our failure to maintain our relationship with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe FHFA is considering changes to guarantee fees that the GSEs charge lenders for guaranteeing the timely payment of principal and interest on their mortgage-backed securities. Since the conservatorships began, the FHFA has gradually increased such guarantee fees. For example, on December 9, 2013, the FHFA proposed an across-the-board 10 basis point increase, along with an increase in the risk-based loan level price adjustment that the GSEs require borrowers to pay, and the elimination of the 25 basis point \"adverse market charge\" for all but four states. However, on January 8, 2014, the FHFA (under new leadership) changed course and suspended implementation of those changes pending further review. Increases in guarantee fees or changes to their structure may generally raise lending costs and restrict the availability of credit, particularly to higher risk borrowers, and affect our ability to grow both our servicing and lending portfolios.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about borrowers and counterparties and any misrepresented information could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or to enter into other transactions with borrowers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of borrowers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of borrowers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the loan applicant, the mortgage broker, correspondent lender, another third party or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Our correspondent clients are generally obligated to repurchase any loans they have sold to us for which a misrepresentation has been made. We, however, may not have detected or may not detect all misrepresented information in our loan originations or from our business clients. Any such misrepresented information could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to make indemnification payments relating to, and/or repurchase, mortgage loans we sold or securitized, or will sell or securitize, if our representations and warranties relating to these mortgage loans are inaccurate at the time the loan is sold or securitized, or under other circumstances.\nWe generally sell or securitize the loans that we originate to finance our future operations. Our contracts relating to mortgage loans we sell or securitize contain provisions that require us, under certain circumstances, to make indemnification payments relating to, and/or repurchase, such loans. Our indemnification and repurchase obligations vary contract by contract, but such contracts typically require us to either make an indemnification payment and/or repurchase a loan if, among other things:\n\u2022\nour representations and warranties relating to the loan are materially inaccurate, including but not limited to representations concerning loan underwriting, regulatory compliance or property appraisals;\n\u2022\nwe fail to secure adequate mortgage insurance within a certain period after closing; or\n\u2022\nthe borrower fails to make certain initial loan payments due to the purchaser.\nWe believe that our maximum repurchase exposure under such contracts is the origination UPB of all mortgage loans we have sold or securitized. At December 31, 2014, we had sold or securitized mortgage loans with an origination UPB of $31.2 billion. To recognize the potential mortgage loan repurchase or indemnification losses, we have recorded a reserve of $11.0 million as of December 31, 2014. In 2014, we incurred losses of $0.8 million related to such indemnification and repurchase activity. Because we expect our mortgage loan originations to increase in the future, our indemnification and repurchase requests may also increase. Due, in part, to elevated mortgage payment delinquency rates and declining housing prices, originators have experienced, and may in the future continue to experience, an increase in loan repurchase and indemnification claims due to actual or alleged breaches of representations\nand warranties in connection with the sale or servicing of mortgage loans. The estimation of our loan repurchase and indemnification liability is subjective and based upon our projections of the future incidence of loan repurchase and indemnification claims, as well as loss severities. Given these trends, losses incurred in connection with such actual or projected loan repurchase and indemnification claims may be in excess of our estimates (including our estimate of liabilities we will assume in an acquisition and factor into our purchase price). As such, our reserve for indemnification and repurchase obligations may increase in the future. If we are required to make indemnification payments with respect to, and/or repurchase, mortgage loans that we originate and sell or securitize in amounts that result in losses that exceed our reserve, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FHFA has been proposing revisions to the GSE's standard representation and warranty framework, under which the GSEs require lenders to repurchase mortgage loans under certain circumstances. For example, in January 2013, the FHFA sought to relieve lenders of obligations to repurchase loans that had clean payment histories for 36 months. In May 2014, the FHFA and the GSEs announced additional clarifications. While those representation and warranty efforts appear intended to provide additional clarity to lenders regarding the GSEs' repurchase criteria and to reverse the restriction on lending, it is unclear what the result of the FHFA's efforts in this regard will be and how that will affect our business.\nWe originate, securitize and service reverse mortgages, which subjects us to additional risks and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe originate, securitize and service reverse mortgages. The reverse mortgage business is subject to substantial risks, including market, credit, interest rate, liquidity, operational, reputational and legal risks. A reverse mortgage (e.g., a HECM) is a loan available to seniors aged 62 or older that allows homeowners to borrow money against the value of their home. We depend on our ability to securitize reverse mortgages, subsequent draws, mortgage insurance premiums and servicing fees, and would be adversely affected if our ability to access the securitization market were to be limited. Defaults on reverse mortgages leading to foreclosures may occur if borrowers fail to meet maintenance obligations, such as payment of taxes or home insurance premiums, or fail to meet occupancy requirements. An increase in foreclosure rates may increase our cost of servicing. We may become subject to negative publicity in the event that defaults on reverse mortgages lead to foreclosures or even evictions of senior homeowners.\nAs a reverse mortgage servicer, we are responsible for funding any payments due to borrowers in a timely manner, remitting to credit owners interest accrued, paying for interest shortfalls, and funding advances such as taxes and home insurance premiums. During any period in which a borrower is not making required real estate tax and property insurance premium payments, we may be required under servicing agreements to advance our own funds to pay property taxes, insurance premiums, legal expenses and other protective advances. We also may be required to advance funds to maintain, repair and market real estate properties. In certain situations, our contractual obligations may require us to make certain advances for which we may not be reimbursed. In addition, in the event a mortgage loan serviced by us defaults or becomes delinquent, the repayment to us of the advance may be delayed until the mortgage loan is repaid or refinanced or liquidation occurs. A delay in our ability to collect advances may adversely affect our liquidity, and our inability to be reimbursed for advances could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Advances are typically recovered upon weekly or monthly reimbursement or from securitization in the market. We could receive requests for advances in excess of amounts we are able to fund, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity. All of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaterial changes to the laws, regulations, rules or practices applicable to reverse mortgage programs operated by FHA, HUD or Ginnie Mae, or a loss of our approved status under such programs, could adversely affect our reverse mortgage segment.\nThe reverse mortgage industry is largely dependent upon the FHA, HUD and government entities like Ginnie Mae. There can be no guarantee that any or all of these entities will continue to participate in the reverse mortgage industry or that they will not make material changes to the laws, regulations, rules or practices applicable to reverse mortgage programs. The principal reverse mortgage loan product we originate is the HECM, an FHA-insured loan that must comply with the FHA and other regulatory requirements. The FHA regulations governing the HECM product have changed from time to time. For example, the FHA, on January 30, 2013, consolidated its standard fixed-rate reverse mortgage program with its fixed-rate saver program, which limits the amounts borrowers can draw. On September 3, 2013, the FHA announced changes to the HECM program, pursuant to authority under the Reverse Mortgage Stabilization Act, signed into law on August 9, 2013. The changes impact initial mortgage insurance premiums and principal limit factors, impose restrictions on the amount of funds that senior borrowers may draw down at closing and during the first 12 months after closing, and will require a financial assessment for all HECM borrowers to ensure that they have the capacity and willingness to meet their financial obligations and the terms of the reverse mortgage. In addition, the changes require borrowers to set aside a portion of the loan proceeds they receive at closing (or withhold a portion of monthly loan disbursements) for the payment of property taxes and homeowners insurance based on the results of the financial assessment. With the exception of new financial assessment requirements and funding requirements for the payment of property charges (which are scheduled to become effective in 2015), the new HECM requirements became effective on September 30, 2013. The FHA also amended or clarified requirements related to HECMs through a series of issuances in 2014, including three Mortgagee Letters issued in June 2014. The new requirements relate to advertising, restrictions on loan provisions, limitations on payment methods, new underwriting requirements, revised\nprincipal limits, revised financial assessment and property charge requirements and the treatment of non-borrowing spouses. These changes adversely affected the volumes and margins of new reverse mortgage originations in 2014. It is unclear how the new financial assessment requirements scheduled to take effect in 2015 will impact our reverse mortgage business.\nIn addition, our status as an approved non-supervised FHA mortgagee and an approved Ginnie Mae issuer and servicer is subject to compliance with FHA\u2019s and Ginnie Mae\u2019s respective regulations, guides, handbooks, mortgagee letters and all participants\u2019 memoranda. If a Ginnie Mae issuer defaults under its program obligations to Ginnie Mae, Ginnie Mae has a right to terminate the approved status of the issuer, seize the mortgage servicing rights of such issuer without compensation (which includes the right to be reimbursed for outstanding advances from the FHA), demand indemnification for its losses, and impose administrative sanctions, which may include civil money penalties. Each subsidiary of the Company that is a Ginnie Mae issuer has also entered into a cross default agreement with Ginnie Mae which provides that, upon the default by a subsidiary under an applicable Ginnie Mae program agreement, Ginnie Mae will have the right to (i) declare a default on all other pools and loan packages of that subsidiary and all pools and loan packages of any affiliated Ginnie Mae issuer that executed the cross default agreement and (ii) exercise any other remedies available under applicable law against each of the affiliated Ginnie Mae issuers.\nAny discontinuation of, or significant reduction or material change in, the operation of the FHA, HUD or government entities like Ginnie Mae, or the loss of our approved non-supervised FHA mortgagee or Ginnie Mae issuer or servicer status, could have a material adverse effect on our overall business and our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our estimated liability with respect to interest curtailment obligations arising out of servicing errors by RMS is inaccurate, or additional errors are found, and we are required to record additional material amounts, there may be an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nSubsequent to the completion of the acquisition of RMS, we discovered a failure to record certain estimated liabilities to credit owners relating to servicing errors by RMS. FHA regulations provide that servicers must meet a series of event-specific timeframes during the default, foreclosure, conveyance, and mortgage insurance claim cycles. Failure to timely meet any processing deadline may stop the accrual of debenture interest otherwise payable in satisfaction of a claim under the FHA mortgage insurance contract and the servicer may be responsible for making the credit owner whole for any interest curtailment due to not meeting the required event-specific timeframes. On September 24, 2013, as a result of these matters, restatements of certain previously filed historical financial information of RMS were filed. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had a curtailment obligation liability of $60.8 million related to the foregoing which reflects management\u2019s best estimate of the probable incurred claim. The curtailment liability is recorded in payables and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company assumed $46.0 million of this liability through the acquisition of RMS, which resulted in a corresponding offset to goodwill and deferred tax assets. The Company has potential estimated maximum financial statement exposure for an additional $157.0 million related to similar claims, which are reasonably possible, but which the Company believes are primarily the responsibility of third parties (e.g., prior servicers and/or credit owners). The Company\u2019s potential exposure to a substantial portion of this additional risk relates to the possibility that such third parties may claim that the Company is responsible for the servicing liability or that the Company exacerbated an existing failure by the third party. The actual amount, if any, of this exposure is difficult to estimate and requires significant management judgment as curtailment obligations are an emerging industry issue. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional errors, that this will not recur in the future, that future financial reports will not contain material misstatements or omissions, or that future restatements will not be required. To the extent we are required to record additional amounts as liabilities, there may be an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nSee Item 3. \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information.\nIf the market for HECM loans and other reverse mortgages does not continue to develop as we anticipate, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe growth of our business depends, in part, on the growth in the demand we anticipate for HECM loans and other reverse mortgages. We expect the demand for reverse mortgages to increase significantly as more potential borrowers reach 62 years of age with limited retirement savings. If the growth in demand for reverse mortgages is not as significant as we anticipate or does not occur as rapidly as we expect as a result of regulatory changes or other factors which we cannot predict, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to fund our HECM repurchase obligations, and/or face delays in our ability to make such repurchases, or we may be unable to assign repurchased HECM loans to the FHA, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe issue HMBS collateralized by HECM loans we originate. Under the Ginnie Mae HMBS program, we are required to repurchase a HECM loan from the HMBS pool when the outstanding principal balance of the HECM loan is equal to or greater than 98% of the\nmaximum claim amount. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the funding necessary to satisfy our repurchase obligations, particularly if our actual repurchase obligations materially exceed our estimated repurchase obligations.\nWhen we repurchase a HECM loan from a HMBS pool, we assign the repurchased HECM loan to the FHA and receive reimbursement if the HECM loan is not in default. If the HECM loan is in default (e.g., if the borrower has failed to pay real estate taxes or property insurance premiums), the FHA will not accept the loan for assignment and we must continue to hold and service the loan, which exposes us to a risk of loss of principal. Foreclosure of a HECM loan can be an expensive and lengthy process which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed HECM loan.\nWhen we securitize HECM loans into HMBS, we are required to covenant and warrant to Ginnie Mae, among other things, that the HECM loans related to each participation included in the HMBS are eligible under the requirements of the National Housing Act and the Ginnie Mae Mortgage-Backed Securities Guide, and that we will take all actions necessary to continue to ensure the HECM loans continued eligibility. The Ginnie Mae HMBS program requires that we repurchase the participation related to any HECM loan that does not meet the requirements of the Ginnie Mae Mortgage-Backed Securities Guide. Significant repurchase requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to fund our HECM repurchase obligations, or face delays in our ability to make such repurchases, or are unable, to assign repurchased HECM loans to the FHA, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may suffer operating losses as a result of not being fully reimbursed for certain costs and interest expenses on our HECM loans, or if we fail to originate or service loans in conformity with FHA\u2019s guidelines.\nThe FHA will reimburse us for most HECM loan losses incurred by us, up to the maximum claim amount, if, upon disposition of the collateral a deficit exists between the value of the collateral and the loan balance. However, there are certain costs and expenses that the FHA will not reimburse. Additionally, the FHA pays the FHA debenture rate instead of the loan interest rate from the date the loan becomes due and payable to the date of disposition of the property or final appraisal. In the event the pass through rate we are required to pay to an HMBS investor exceeds the FHA debenture rate, we will suffer an interest rate loss.\nAdditionally, if we fail to service HECM loans in conformity with FHA\u2019s guidelines, we could lose our right to service the portfolio or be subject to financial penalties that could affect our ability to receive loss claims or result in the curtailment of FHA debenture rate reimbursement. The FHA may also at its discretion request indemnification from a lender on a possible loss on a HECM loan if it determines that the loan was not originated or serviced in conformity with its rules or regulations.\nIf we are unable to fund our tail commitments or securitize our HECM loans (including tails), this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe originate HECM loans with the intention of securitizing them, and we expect to securitize principal additions to a borrower\u2019s HECM loan balance (for mortgage insurance premiums, servicing fees, interest, and borrower draws on lines-of-credit), which we refer to collectively as \u201ctails.\u201d We currently fund tails on a short-term basis with cash flows from operations until such tails are securitized. As of December 31, 2014, our unfunded tail commitment was $1.1 billion. If our operating cash flows are insufficient to fund our tail commitments and we are unable to obtain one or more alternative sources of funding for such commitments, or we are unable to securitize our HECM loans (including future tails), this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur common stock price may experience substantial volatility which may affect your ability to sell our common stock at an advantageous price.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. For example, the closing market price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange fluctuated between $15.94 per share and $35.97 per share during 2014 and may continue to fluctuate. The volatility may affect your ability to sell our common stock at an advantageous price. Market price fluctuations in our common stock may be due to reduced liquidity resulting from industry and regulatory matters, highly concentrated ownership of our common stock, acquisitions, dispositions or other material public announcements, along with a variety of additional factors including, without limitation, those set forth under these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOur debt agreements contain covenants that restrict our operations and may inhibit flexibility in operating our business and increasing revenues.\nOur 2013 Secured Credit Facilities and the Senior Notes Indenture contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nsell or transfer assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default and our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the secured lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our 2013 Secured Credit Facilities and our other indebtedness.\nWe may also use warehouse facilities, structured financing arrangements, securitizations and other forms of term debt, in addition to transaction or asset-specific financing arrangements, to finance investment purchases. Such financing facilities may contain restrictions, covenants, and representations and warranties that, among other conditions, require us to satisfy specified financial and asset quality tests and may restrict our ability to, among other actions, incur or guarantee additional debt, make certain investments or acquisitions, make distributions on or repurchase or redeem capital stock, engage in mergers or consolidations, grant liens or such other conditions as the lenders may require. If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants or representations and warranties, we would be in default under these agreements and our lenders could elect to declare any and all amounts outstanding under the agreements immediately due and payable, enforce their respective interests against collateral pledged under such agreements, and restrict our ability to make additional borrowings. Many of our financing agreements contain cross-default provisions, such that if a default occurs under any one agreement, the lenders under our other agreements also could declare a default.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively affect our cost of, and ability to access, capital.\nOur ability to obtain adequate and cost effective financing depends in part on our credit ratings. A negative change in our ratings outlook or any downgrade in our current credit ratings by the rating agencies that provide such ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing and/or access to sources of liquidity and capital. Such a downgrade could adversely affect our access to the public and private credit markets and increase the costs of borrowing under available credit lines, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our volume of mortgage loan originations or reduce the value of our MSRs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nHistorically, rising interest rates have generally been associated with a lower volume of loan originations and lower pricing margins due to a disincentive for borrowers to refinance at a higher interest rate, while falling interest rates have generally been associated with higher loan originations and higher pricing margins, due to an incentive for borrowers to refinance at a lower interest rate. Accordingly, increases in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our mortgage loan origination volume, which could have a material and adverse effect on our overall business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, changes in interest rates may require us to post additional collateral under certain of our financing arrangements and derivative agreements which could impact our liquidity.\nChanges in interest rates are also a key driver of the performance of our mortgage servicing business as the values of our MSRs are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. Historically, the value of our MSRs has increased when interest rates rise, as higher interest rates lead to decreased prepayment rates, and has decreased when interest rates decline, as lower interest rates lead to increased prepayment rates. As a result, substantial volatility in interest rates materially affects our mortgage servicing business, as well as our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect results of operations.\nThe Company has from time to time used various derivative financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks. In the future we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate changes by using interest rate hedging agreements, such as interest swaps and options. The nature and timing of hedging transactions may influence the effectiveness of a given hedging strategy, and no hedging strategy is consistently effective. Poorly designed strategies, improperly executed and documented transactions or inaccurate assumptions could actually increase our risks and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. Our hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use may not be able to adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility and our hedging transactions may result in or magnify losses. Furthermore, interest rate derivatives may not be available at all, or at favorable\nterms, particularly during economic downturns. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks related to hedging include:\n\u2022\ninterest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates;\n\u2022\navailable interest rate hedges may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought;\n\u2022\nthe duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability;\n\u2022\nthe credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction;\n\u2022\nthe party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay; and\n\u2022\na court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable.\nTechnology failures or cyber-attacks against us or our vendors could damage our business operations and reputation, increase our costs, and result in significant third party liability.\nThe financial services industry as a whole is characterized by rapidly changing technologies. System disruptions and failures caused by fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion (e.g., cyber-attack), computer viruses and disabling devices, natural disasters and other similar events, may interrupt or delay our ability to provide services to our borrowers. Security breaches, acts of vandalism and developments in computer intrusion capabilities could result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we use to protect our borrowers' personal information and transaction data. Systems failures could result in reputational damage to our business and cause us to incur significant costs and third party liability, and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Cybersecurity\" for additional information relating to cybersecurity.\nWe may be unable to protect our technology or keep up with the technology of our competitors.\nWe rely on proprietary and licensed software, and other technology, proprietary information and intellectual property to operate our business and to provide us with a competitive advantage. However, we may be unable to maintain and protect, or prevent others from misappropriating or otherwise violating, our rights in such software, technology, proprietary information and intellectual property. In addition, competitors may be able to develop software and technologies that are as good as or better than our software and technology without violating our rights, which could put us at a disadvantage. Our failure to maintain, protect and continue to develop our software, technology, proprietary information and intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAny failure of our internal security measures or those of our vendors, or breach of our privacy protections, could cause harm to our reputation and subject us to liability.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we receive and store certain confidential nonpublic information concerning borrowers including names, addresses, social security numbers and other confidential information. Additionally, we enter into third party relationships to assist with various aspects of our business, some of which require the exchange of confidential borrower information. Breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to our systems or our clients' or counterparties' confidential information, including employees and customers, as well as hackers, and through electronic, physical or other means. If such a compromise or breach of our security measures or those of our vendors occurs, and confidential information is misappropriated, it could cause interruptions in our operations and/or expose us to significant liabilities, reporting obligations, remediation costs and damage to our reputation. Significant damage to our reputation or the reputation of our clients could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWhile we have obtained insurance to cover us against certain cyber security risks and information theft, there can be no guarantee that all losses will be covered or that the insurance limits will be sufficient to cover such losses.\nWe have obtained insurance coverage that protects us against losses from unauthorized penetration of company technology systems, employee theft of customer and/or company private information, and company liability for third party vendors who mishandle company information. This insurance includes coverage for third party losses as well as costs incidental to a breach of company systems such as notification, credit monitoring and ID theft resolution services. However, there can be no guarantee that every potential loss due to cyber-attack or theft of information has been insured against, nor that the limits of the insurance we have acquired will be sufficient to cover all such losses.\nOur vendor relationships subject us to a variety of risks.\nWe have vendors that, among other things, provide us with financial, technology and other services to support our businesses. With respect to vendors engaged to perform activities required by servicing or originations criteria or regulatory requirements, we are required to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing or originations criteria or regulatory requirements for the applicable vendor and are required to have procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor\u2019s activities comply in all material respects with servicing or originations criteria or regulatory requirements applicable to the vendor. In the event that a vendor\u2019s activities do not comply with the servicing or originations criteria or regulatory requirements, it could negatively impact our business. In addition, if our current vendors were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may incur significant costs to resolve any such disruptions in service and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our earnings.\nReputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending, loan servicing, debt collection practices, and corporate governance, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can also result from media coverage, whether accurate or not. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, counterparties and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our customers and communities, this risk will always be present in our organization.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive, and, to the extent we fail to meet these competitive challenges or otherwise do not achieve our strategic initiatives, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of economic, legislative, regulatory or technological changes. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources, and typically have access to greater financial resources and lower funding costs. All of these factors place us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more favorable relationships than we can. Competition to service mortgage loans may result in lower margins. Because of the relatively limited number of servicing customers, our failure to meet the expectations of any one of such customers could materially impact our business. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time we announce various strategic initiatives for our business, including without limitation initiatives relating to acquisitions and dispositions of mortgage servicing rights and other assets, balance sheet assessment and optimization, developing and growing certain portions of our business, the use of capital partners, cost savings and operational efficiencies, and other matters. Our ability to achieve such initiatives is dependent upon numerous factors, many of which are not in our control. If we fail to achieve some or all of our strategic initiatives this could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of past, pending or potential future acquisitions or joint venture investments, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe periodically explore opportunities to grow our business through the acquisition of MSRs and other businesses and assets. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of past, pending or potential future acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate these acquisitions into our business and is subject to certain risks, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully combine the acquired businesses with ours;\n\u2022\nwhether the combined businesses will perform as expected;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we inappropriately value assets or businesses we acquire, that we pay more than the value we will derive from the acquisitions, or that the value declines after the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe reduction of our cash available for operations and other uses;\n\u2022\nthe disruption to our operations inherent in making numerous acquisitions over a relatively short period of time;\n\u2022\nthe disruption to the ongoing operations at the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of significant indebtedness to finance our acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of certain known and unknown liabilities of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nuncoordinated market functions;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues and delays in integrating the acquired business or any information, communications or other systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;\n\u2022\nunanticipated liabilities associated with the acquired business, assets or joint venture;\n\u2022\nadditional costs or capital requirements beyond forecasted amounts;\n\u2022\ndelays in the completion of acquisitions, including due to delays in or the failure to obtain approvals from governmental or regulatory entities;\n\u2022\nlack of expected synergies, failure to realize the anticipated benefits we expect to realize from the acquisition or joint venture, or failure of the assets or businesses we acquire to perform at levels meeting our expectations;\n\u2022\nnot retaining key employees; and\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns.\nThese risks are increased by the fact that we have acquired several disparate businesses, located across the country, in a relatively short period of time. If we are not able to successfully combine the acquired businesses and assets with ours within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses and assets may not perform as expected, and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nFurther, prices at which acquisitions can be made fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices we considered acceptable, and we expect that we will experience this condition in the future. In addition, in order to finance an acquisition we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or raise additional capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders. Also, it is possible that we will expend considerable resources in the pursuit of an acquisition that, ultimately, either does not close or is terminated. If we incur additional indebtedness to finance an acquisition, the acquired business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service that additional indebtedness.\nWe cannot assure you that future acquisitions or joint ventures will not adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, or that we will realize all of the anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions or joint ventures.\nWe use, and will continue to use, analytical models and data in connection with the pricing of new business and the valuation of our future investments, and any incorrect, misleading or incomplete information used in connection therewith may subject us to potential risks.\nGiven the complexity of our proposed future investments and strategies, we rely, and will continue to rely, on analytical models and information and data, some of which is supplied by third parties. Should our models or such data prove to be incorrect or misleading, any decision made in reliance thereon exposes us to potential risks. Some of the analytical models that we use or will be used by us are predictive in nature. The use of predictive models has inherent risks and may incorrectly forecast future behavior, leading to potential losses. We also use and will continue to use valuation models that rely on market data inputs. If incorrect market data is input into a valuation model, even a tested and well-respected valuation model, it may provide incorrect valuations and, as a result, could provide adverse actual results as compared to the predictive results.\nWe use estimates in determining the fair value of certain assets. If our estimates prove to be incorrect, we may be required to write down the value of these assets which could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe estimate the fair value for certain assets and liabilities by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing assumptions that we believe are used by market participants. The methodology used to estimate these values is complex and uses asset-specific collateral data and market inputs for interest and discount rates and liquidity dates.\nValuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of our valuation methodologies. If prepayment speeds increase more than estimated, delinquency and default levels are higher than anticipated or financial market illiquidity continues beyond our estimate, we may be required to write down the value of certain assets which could adversely affect our earnings.\nAccounting rules for certain of our transactions continue to evolve, are highly complex, and involve significant judgments and assumptions. Changes in accounting interpretations or assumptions could impact our financial statements.\nAccounting rules for our business, such as the rules for determining the fair value measurement and disclosure of financial instruments, are highly complex and involve significant judgment and assumptions. These complexities could lead to a delay in the preparation of financial information and the delivery of this information to our stockholders. Changes in accounting interpretations or assumptions related to fair value could impact our financial statements and our ability to timely prepare our financial statements.\nImpairment charges relating to our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial performance.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $575 million of goodwill and $104 million of other intangible assets. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of October 1 of each year, or whenever events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. A significant decline in our reporting unit performance, increases in equity capital requirements, increases in the estimated cost of debt or equity, a significant adverse change in the business climate or a sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate our taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill. We incurred an $82.3 million impairment charge during 2014 as a result of a goodwill evaluation performed in the second quarter of 2014. The evaluation indicated the estimated implied fair value of the Reverse Mortgage reporting unit\u2019s goodwill was less than its carrying value, therefore requiring the impairment charge. If we determine that our goodwill or another intangible asset is impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIf we do not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we could fail to accurately report our financial results, which may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal controls over financial reporting and have our independent auditors issue their own opinion on our internal controls over financial reporting. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. A material weakness is defined by the standards issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIt is possible that material weaknesses and/or control deficiencies could be identified by our management or by our independent auditing firm in the future, or may occur without being identified. The existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency could require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate such weakness or deficiency and management may not be able to remediate the same in a timely manner. Any such weakness or deficiency, even if remediated quickly, could result in regulatory scrutiny, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial condition, lead to a default under our indebtedness, materially affect the market price and trading liquidity of our debt instruments, reduce the market value of our common stock and otherwise materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur business could suffer if we fail to attract and retain our senior managers and a highly skilled workforce.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization, in particular skilled managers, loan servicers, debt default specialists, loan officers and underwriters. Trained and experienced personnel are in high demand and may be in short supply in some areas. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. We may not be able to attract, develop and maintain an adequate skilled workforce necessary to operate our businesses and labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of qualified personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain such personnel, we may not be able to take advantage of acquisitions and other growth opportunities that may be presented to us and this could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe experience of our senior managers is a valuable asset to us. Our management team has significant experience in the residential loans originations and servicing industry. The loss of the services of our senior managers could adversely affect our business.\nOur reputation, business and operations could be adversely affected if there are regulatory compliance failures related to our investment adviser activities.\nOne of our subsidiaries, GTIM, is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act. GTIM provides investment advisory and related services to investment advisory clients. A failure by GTIM to comply with the requirements of the Advisers Act, including record-keeping, advertising and operating requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities, could result in investigations, sanctions and reputational damage.\nWe will have to manage the conflicts of interests inherent in the investment allocation commitments we have made to WCO and our own investment objectives. Our failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest could damage our reputation, expose us to regulatory risks, and adversely affect our business.\nWCO\u2019s investment objectives include the acquisition of WCO Target Assets, which include servicing-related assets of the type that we have historically acquired (or retained) and that we may be interested in acquiring (or retaining) in the future. We have agreed to provide WCO with certain rights of first offer in certain investment opportunities in WCO Target Assets, which could limit our ability to acquire (or retain) such assets ourselves. We have adopted an allocation policy pursuant to which WCO will have certain rights of first offer to invest in certain percentages of WCO Target Assets identified by us or our affiliates while WCO\u2019s management agreement with GTIM is in effect. In addition, we have specific contractual commitments with WCO relating to certain WCO Target Assets we may originate or otherwise create in the future. In order to comply with the allocation policy and these contractual commitments to WCO, we have adopted internal compliance policies and procedures.\nMr. Dixon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Investment Officer, also serves as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Investment Officer and a member of the board of directors of WCO. Mr. Dixon may have conflicts between his duties to us and our subsidiaries and his duties to WCO. Mr. Dixon also owns shares of us but not WCO, which could create the perception of additional conflicts of interest regarding investment decisions for WCO and us. The management team of WCO is comprised of persons that are also officers and/or employees of Walter and its subsidiaries, and such persons may have conflicts between their duties to us and our subsidiaries and their duties to WCO. Mr. O'Brien, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, served on the board of directors of WCO until his voluntary resignation from such board, effective December 31, 2014. We have attempted to address these potential conflicts through our internal compliance policies and procedures, our allocation policy and the agreements we negotiated with WCO, although no assurance can be given that conflicts will not nevertheless arise.\nAppropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest. It is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to disagreements with WCO or regulatory enforcement actions as a result of GTIM\u2019s obligations as the investment advisor to WCO. Conflicts of interest may also exist or develop regarding various matters, including decisions about the allocation of specific investment opportunities between us on the one hand and WCO on the other, in situations involving sales of assets by us to WCO, and in situations where we may seek to service mortgage assets held by WCO. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, hamper our ability to raise additional funds, discourage counterparties to do business with us, and damage our investment in WCO and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nCertain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit a change in our control.\nCertain provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in our control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of such shares. We are subject to the \"business combination\" provisions of the MGCL that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an \"interested stockholder\" (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of our then outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of our then outstanding stock) or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and, thereafter, imposes special appraisal rights and supermajority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations. These provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the Board of Directors of a corporation prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Pursuant to the statute, our Board of Directors has by resolution exempted business combinations between us and any other person, provided that the business combination is first approved by our Board of Directors. This resolution, however, may be altered or repealed in whole or in part at any time. If this resolution is repealed, or our Board of Directors does not otherwise approve a business combination, this statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and may increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.\nThe \"control share\" provisions of the MGCL provide that \"control shares\" of a Maryland corporation (defined as shares which, when aggregated with all other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in the election of directors) acquired in a \"control share acquisition\" (defined as the acquisition of issued and outstanding \"control shares,\" subject to certain exceptions) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding votes entitled to be cast by the acquirer of control shares, our officers and our employees who are also our directors. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from\nthe control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of our shares of stock. There can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.\nThe \"unsolicited takeover\" provisions of the MGCL permit our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain provisions if we have a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act and at least three independent directors. These provisions may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in our control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price.\nOur Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors. Directors of each class are elected for three-year terms upon the expiration of their current terms, and each year one class of directors will be elected by our stockholders. The staggered terms of our directors may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt at a change in control, even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur charter authorizes our Board of Directors to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our stockholders. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, liquidation rights, or voting rights. If we issue preferred stock, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of our common stock or adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of our common stock.\nOur authorized but unissued shares of common and preferred stock may prevent a change in our control.\nOur charter authorizes us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock. In addition, our Board of Directors may, without stockholder approval, classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock into other classes or series of shares and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. As a result, our Board of Directors may establish a class or series of shares of common or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our shares of common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Walter Energy\nWe may have substantial additional liability for U.S. federal income tax allegedly owed by Walter Energy or otherwise under the Tax Separation Agreement with Walter Energy.\nThe Company\u2019s business was established in 1958 as the Financing business of Walter Energy, which decided in 2008 to spin off its Financing business via a newly created subsidiary, Walter Investment Management, LLC, or WIM. As such, the Company was part of the Walter Energy consolidated group prior to the spin-off from Walter Energy on April 17, 2009 and subsequent merger with Hanover. Each member of a consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group for any year in which it is a member of the group at any time during such year. However, in connection with the spin-off from Walter Energy, the Company and Walter Energy entered into a Tax Separation Agreement, dated April 17, 2009, pursuant to which Walter Energy retains any liability for adjustments to the U.S. federal income or state combined income taxes of the consolidated group for such years that the Company was a member of the consolidated group (including any interest or penalties applicable thereto) resulting from an audit or other settlement or compromise with any taxing authority, subject to limited exceptions. Nonetheless, to the extent that Walter Energy is unable to pay any amounts owed, the Company could be responsible for any unpaid amounts. These amounts may include, according to Walter Energy\u2019s public filing on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, those relating to the following:\n\u2022\nthe IRS has filed a \"proof of claim\" for a substantial amount of taxes, interest, and penalties with respect to fiscal years ended August 31, 1983 through May 31, 1994. The public filing goes on to disclose that issues have been litigated in bankruptcy court and that an opinion was issued by the court in June 2010 as to the remaining disputed issues. The filing further states that the amounts initially asserted by the IRS do not reflect the subsequent resolution of various issues through settlements or concessions by the parties. Walter Energy believes that any financial exposure with respect to those issues that have not been resolved or settled by the proof of claim is limited to interest and possible penalties and the amount of tax assessed has been offset by tax reductions in future years. All of the issues in the proof of claim, which have not been settled or conceded, have been litigated before the Bankruptcy Court and are subject to appeal, but only at the conclusion of the entire adversary proceedings;\n\u2022\nthe IRS completed its audit of Walter Energy\u2019s federal income tax returns for the years ended May 31, 2000 through December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006 through December 31, 2008. The IRS issued 30-Day Letters to Walter Energy proposing changes to tax for these tax years which Walter Energy has protested. Walter Energy's filing states that, as of September 30, 2014, the IRS Appeals Office has returned these tax periods to IRS Examination Division to be placed into suspense pending resolution of the above-referenced tax periods. The disputed issues in these audit periods are similar to the issues remaining in the above-referenced dispute; and\n\u2022\nWalter Energy reports that the IRS is conducting an audit of Walter Energy\u2019s tax returns filed for 2009 through 2012. Since examination is ongoing, Walter Energy cannot estimate the amount of any resulting tax deficiency or overpayment, if any.\nThe Tax Separation Agreement provides that Walter Energy has sole and exclusive responsibility for the preparation and filing of consolidated federal income and consolidated or combined state and local tax returns (or amended returns), and has the power, in its sole discretion, to contest or compromise any asserted tax adjustment or deficiency and to file, litigate or compromise any claim for refund on behalf of the Company related to any such combined, consolidated or unitary (as applicable) federal, state or local tax return. This arrangement may result in conflicts of interests between us and Walter Energy. As stated above, to the extent that Walter Energy is unable to pay taxes, if any, attributable to the spin-off and for which it is responsible under the Tax Separation Agreement, we could be liable for those taxes as a result of WIM being a member of the Walter Energy consolidated group for the year in which the spin-off occurred.\nIn addition, the Tax Separation Agreement allocates to us specified tax risks associated with our spin-off and the merger with Hanover, and imposes other obligations that may affect our business. The Tax Separation Agreement provides generally that if the spin-off is determined not to be tax-free pursuant to Section 355 of the Code, as intended, certain distribution taxes which are the result of the acts or omissions of Walter Energy or its affiliates will be the responsibility of Walter Energy. However, should certain distribution taxes result from the acts or omissions of the Company or its affiliates, such distribution taxes will be the responsibility of the Company. The Tax Separation Agreement goes on to provide that Walter Energy and the Company will be jointly liable, pursuant to a designated allocation formula, for certain distribution taxes that are not specifically allocated to Walter Energy or the Company. The Tax Separation Agreement also provides for payments from Walter Energy in the event that an additional taxable dividend is required to cure a REIT disqualification from the determination of a shortfall in the distribution of non-REIT earnings and profits made immediately following the spin-off. Moreover, the Tax Separation Agreement obligates us to take certain tax positions that are consistent with those taken historically by Walter Energy. In the event we do not take such positions, we could be liable to Walter Energy to the extent our failure to do so results in an increased tax liability or the reduction of any tax asset of Walter Energy.\nWe cannot currently estimate our reasonably possible losses arising under or relating to the Tax Separation Agreement, and we therefore cannot provide any assurance that such losses, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and/or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 85909, "SIC": 6163, "TIC": "DHCPQ"}
