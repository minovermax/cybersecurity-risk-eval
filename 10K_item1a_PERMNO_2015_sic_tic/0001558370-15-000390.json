RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves risks. Before making an investment decision, investors should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the following risks or other risks, which have not been identified or which we may believe are immaterial or unlikely, actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In such a case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business may be impacted by the existence of the informal agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\nOur success as a business is dependent upon pursuing various alternatives in achieving the growth and expansion of our banking franchise. We are prohibited from paying cash dividends without the prior written approval of the Reserve Bank and the Director of the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Our ability to raise capital could be potentially limited or impacted as a result of the informal agreement. Attracting new management talent is critical to the success of our business and could be potentially impacted due to the existence of the informal agreement.\nOur business is subject to the success of the local economies and real estate markets in which we operate.\nOur earnings are significantly generated from net interest income which is heavily reliant on the interest and fees we earn on loans. If prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, our business may be adversely affected. Unfavorable economic conditions in our targeted market areas, specifically depressed or declining real estate values could affect the ability of customers to repay their loans, impede our growth, and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations through potential increases in credit losses. We are less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across broader and more diverse economies.\nOur concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans is subject to unique risks that could adversely affect our earnings.\nOur commercial real estate and construction and land development loan portfolio held for investment was $220.7 million at December 31, 2014 comprising 53% of total loans. Commercial real estate and construction and development loans are often riskier and tend to have significantly larger balances than home equity loans or residential mortgage loans to individuals. While we believe that the commercial real estate concentration risk is mitigated by diversification among the types and characteristics of real estate collateral properties, sound underwriting practices, and ongoing portfolio monitoring and market analysis, the repayments of these loans usually depends on the successful operation of a business or the sale of the underlying\nproperty. As a result, these loans are more likely to be unfavorably affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Commercial and industrial loans comprise 18% of the loan portfolio. These loans are collateralized by various business assets the value of which may decline during adverse market and economic conditions. Adverse conditions in the real estate market and the economy may result in increasing levels of loan charge-offs and non-performing assets and the reduction of earnings. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral, which may ultimately result in a loss.\nOur allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nLike all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for loan and lease defaults and non-performance. Our allowance for loan and lease losses is based on our historical loss experience as well as an evaluation of the risks associated with our loan portfolio, including the size and composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio. Our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan and lease losses and future provisions for loan and lease losses could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur future growth may require us to raise additional capital but, that capital may not always be available.\nWe are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate capital levels to support our operations. We anticipate that our current capital will satisfy our regulatory requirements for the foreseeable future. However, in order to maintain our well-capitalized status and to support future growth we may need to raise capital. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend, in part, on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Basel III introduced new minimum capital requirements that became effective on January 1, 2015, with the capital conservation buffer requirements phased in over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2016. Additionally, the Series A Preferred Stock outstanding has a preferred cumulative dividend rate of 9% per annum and contains provisions which include restrictions on the payment of dividends on common stock and on repurchases of any shares of preferred stock ranking equal to or junior to the Series A Preferred Stock or common stock while the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding. These provisions may make it more difficult to raise additional capital on favorable terms while the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding. As of December 31, 2014, the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred stock were 18,856 and the dividend in arrears was $6.6 million, which has not been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we may be unable to raise additional capital, or to raise capital on terms acceptable to us. In addition, if we decide to raise additional capital, the existing shareholders are subject to dilution and a potential capital raise could adversely impact the Company\u2019s deferred tax asset. If we cannot raise additional capital when required, our ability to further expand operations through both internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired.\nWe may suffer losses in our loan portfolio despite our underwriting practices.\nWe seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices. These practices often include: analysis of a borrower\u2019s credit history, financial statements, tax returns and cash flow projections; valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers; and verification of liquid assets. Although we believe that our underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans we make, we may incur losses on loans that meet these criteria.\nHolders of our Series A Preferred Stock have certain voting rights that may adversely affect our common shareholders, and the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may have interests different from our common shareholders.\nFor as long as shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of the shareholders required by law or our Articles of Incorporation, the vote or consent of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock outstanding is required for any authorization or issuance of shares ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock; any amendments to the rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to adversely affect the rights, privileges, or voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock; or initiation and completion of any merger, share exchange or similar transaction unless the shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, or if we are not the surviving entity in such transaction, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity and the shares of Series A Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preference securities have the rights, preferences, privileges and voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe holders of our Series A Preferred Stock may have different interests from the holders of our common stock, and could vote to block the forgoing transactions, even when considered desirable by, or in the best interests of the holders of our common stock.\nOur ability to pay dividends depends primarily on dividends from our banking subsidiary, which are subject to regulatory limits. Additionally, we are subject to other dividend limitations.\nWe are a bank holding company and our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect subsidiaries, each of which is a separate and distinct legal entity. Substantially all of our assets are held by such subsidiaries; and our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of dividends from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Royal Bank is our primary source of dividends. Dividend payments from Royal Bank are subject to legal and regulatory limitations, generally based on net profits and retained earnings, imposed by the various banking regulatory agencies. The ability of Royal Bank to pay dividends is also subject to its profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. At December 31, 2014, as a result of significant losses within Royal Bank from prior years, we had an accumulated deficit and therefore would not have been able to declare and pay any cash dividends. There is no assurance that our subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends in the future, or that we will generate adequate cash flow to pay dividends in the future.\nWe suspended regular quarterly cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in August 2009 and, accordingly, are not permitted at this time to pay dividends on our Class A or Class B Common Stock. Additionally, under the terms of the informal agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank, we are prohibited from redeeming the Series A Preferred Stock or paying any dividends on shares of our stock without the prior written approval of the Reserve Bank and the Director of the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Failure to pay dividends on our stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2014 the Company had a federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $60.1 million and state NOL carryforwards of $145.3 million, which are available to be carried forward to future tax years. The federal NOL carryforward will begin to expire in 2029 and the state NOLs will begin to expire in 2027 if not fully utilized.\nThe ability to use NOLs will be dependent on our ability to generate taxable income. The NOLs may expire before we generate sufficient taxable income. There were no NOLs that expired in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. There are $4.0 million in NOL carryovers from the acquisition of Knoblauch State Bank. Our ability to utilize these carryovers will expire in 2015.\nWe may not be able to fully recover our deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2014, the net deferred tax liability was approximately $308,000 compared to a net deferred tax asset balance of approximately $2.2 million at December 31, 2013.\nWe regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management\u2019s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.\nBased on the analysis of the available positive and negative evidence, we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded as of December 31, 2014. The deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $39.1 million at December 31, 2014. The release of this valuation allowance would have a positive impact on future earnings. There can be no assurance as to when we could be in a position to recapture the benefits of our deferred tax asset.\nCompetition from other financial institutions may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in originating commercial and consumer loans. This competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies and other lenders. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages,\nincluding greater financial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce our net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that we originate and the interest rates we may charge on these loans.\nIn attracting business and consumer deposits, Royal Bank faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources, more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition and more branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do, which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, we may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase our cost of funds.\nThe Company\u2019s banking and non-banking subsidiaries also compete with non-bank providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance agencies, peer to peer lenders and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable terms. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our banking operations. As a result, such non-bank competitors may have advantages over the Company\u2019s banking and non-banking subsidiaries in providing certain products and services. This competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking and non-banking services, reduce our market share, and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nOur ability to manage liquidity is always critical in our operation, but more so today given the uncertainty within the capital markets.\nWe monitor and manage our liquidity position on a regular basis to insure that adequate funds are in place to manage the day to day operations and to cover routine fluctuations in available funds. However, our funding decisions can be influenced by unplanned events. These unplanned events include, but are not limited to, the inability to fund asset growth, difficulty renewing or replacing funds that mature, the ability to maintain or draw down lines of credit with other financial institutions, significant customer withdrawals of deposits, and market disruptions. We have a liquidity contingency plan in the event liquidity falls below an acceptable level, however in today\u2019s economic environment, we are not certain that those sources of liquid funds will be available in the future when required. As a result, loan growth may be curtailed to maintain adequate liquidity. Additionally, loans may need to be sold in the secondary market, investments may need to be sold or deposits may need to be raised at above market interest rates to maintain liquidity.\nNegative publicity could damage our reputation and adversely impact our business and financial results.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our earnings and capital from negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, acquisitions, cyber-attacks, breach in security, and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative publicity can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract\ncustomers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with customers and other constituencies, as a larger diversified financial services company with a high industry profile, we are inherently exposed to this risk.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nDifficult real estate market conditions and economic trends can adversely affect our industry and our business.\nWe have exposure to downturns in both the commercial and residential real estate markets. Dramatic declines in the housing market can lead to decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures. This negative market condition can adversely impact the credit performance of mortgage, consumer, commercial and construction loan portfolios, resulting in significant impairments of assets held by many financial institutions. General downward economic trends, reduced availability of commercial credit and sustained unemployment may negatively impact the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit, resulting in write-downs of real estate collateral supporting many loans. Concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy may result in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each\nother. This type of market turmoil and tightening of credit can led to increased commercial and consumer deficiencies, lack of customer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity. Financial institutions can also experience decreased access to borrowings.\nA decline in current economic conditions would likely put pressure on consumers and businesses and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. In particular, as the result of a deteriorating economy we may face the following risks:\n\u00b7\nWe could face increased regulation of our industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\n\u00b7\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to accurately estimate the losses inherent in our credit portfolio could be more complex.\n\u00b7\nWe may be required to pay higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums because financial institution failures resulting from the depressed market conditions have depleted and may continue to deplete the deposit insurance fund and reduce its ratio of reserves to insured deposits.\n\u00b7\nOur ability to borrow from other financial institutions or the Federal Home Loan Bank on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events.\n\u00b7\nWe may experience increases in foreclosures, delinquencies and customer bankruptcies.\n\u00b7\nWe may experience difficulty in liquidating our OREO portfolio at favorable prices.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk, and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance.\nChanges in the interest rate environment may reduce profits. The primary source of our income is the differential or \u201cspread\u201d between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. As prevailing interest rates change, net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and re-pricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans, and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations. An increase in the general level of interest rates may also adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially adversely affect our net interest spread, asset quality, loan origination volume, pre-payment speeds and overall profitability.\nRecent and future governmental regulation and legislation could limit our future growth and adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs described under \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d we are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, and the deposit insurance fund. Any changes to these laws may negatively affect our ability to expand our services and to increase the value of our business. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on our business, these changes could be materially adverse to shareholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in\ntheir supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\nChanges in consumers\u2019 use of banks and changes in consumers\u2019 spending and saving habits could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nTechnology and other changes now allow many consumers to complete financial transactions without using banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. This disintermediation could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect our operations, and we may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes that are accepted by new and existing customers.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer-relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur; or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability; any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face the risk of cyber-attack to our computer systems.\nOur computer systems, software and networks have been and will continue to be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss, or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events. These threats may derive from human error, fraud, or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. If one or more of these events occurs, it could result in the disclosure of confidential client information, damage to our reputation with our clients and the market, additional costs to us (such as repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection technologies), regulatory penalties and financial losses, to both us and our clients and customers. Such events could also cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations (such as the lack of availability of our online banking system), as well as the operations of our clients, customers or other third parties. Although we maintain safeguards to protect against these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer losses in the future that may be material in amount.\nActs or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.\nGeopolitical conditions may also affect our earnings. Acts or threats or terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to terrorism, or similar activity, could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.\nOther Risks\nOur directors, executive officers and principal shareholders own a significant portion of our common stock and can influence shareholder decisions.\nOur directors, executive officers and principal shareholders, as a group, beneficially owned approximately 33% of our Class A common stock and 87% of our Class B common stock outstanding as of February 28, 2015. As a result of their ownership, the directors, executive officers and principal shareholders will have the ability, by voting their shares in concert, to influence the outcome of any matter submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors. The directors and executive officers may vote to cause the Company to take actions with which the other shareholders do not agree or that are not beneficial to all shareholders.", "PERMNO": 11750, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "RBPAA"}
