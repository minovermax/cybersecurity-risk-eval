Risk Factors\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nThe following factors describe some of the assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could adversely affect our business or that could necessitate unforeseen changes to the ways we operate our businesses or could otherwise result in changes that differ materially from our expectations. In addition to the specific factors mentioned in this report, we may also be affected by other factors that affect businesses generally such as global or regional changes in economic, business or political conditions, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, climate change and natural disasters.\nMarket and Liquidity Risks\nOur business is subject to significant credit risk.\nIn the normal course of our businesses, we are involved in the execution, settlement and financing of various customer and principal securities and derivative transactions. These activities are transacted on a cash, margin or delivery-versus-payment basis and are subject to the risk of counterparty or customer nonperformance. Even when transactions are collateralized by the underlying security or other securities, we still face the risks associated with changes in the market value of the collateral through settlement date or during the time when margin is extended and collateral has not been secured or the counterparty defaults before collateral or margin can be adjusted. We may also incur credit risk in our derivative transactions to the extent such transactions result in uncollateralized credit exposure to our counterparties.\nWe seek to control the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits and by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily. We may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or return collateral pledged. In certain circumstances, we may, under industry regulations, purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty. However, there can be no assurances that our risk controls will be successful.\nWe are exposed to market risk and our principal trading and investments expose us to risk of loss.\nMarket risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including trading account assets and liabilities, loans, securities, short-term borrowings, corporate debt, and derivatives. Market conditions that change from time to time, thereby exposing us to market risk, include fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, relative exchange rates, and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.\nIn addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell, syndicate, or realize the value of security positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increase capital requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nA considerable portion of our revenues is derived from trading in which we act as principal. We may incur trading losses relating to the purchase, sale or short sale of fixed income, high yield, international, convertible, and equity securities, loans, derivative contracts and commodities for our own account. In any period, we may experience losses on our inventory positions as a result of the level and volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity prices (including oil prices), lack of trading volume and illiquidity. From time to time, we may engage in a large block trade in a single security or maintain large position concentrations in a single security, securities of a single issuer, securities of issuers engaged in a specific industry, or securities from issuers located in a particular country or region. In general, because our inventory is marked to market on a daily basis, any adverse price movement in these securities could result in a reduction of our revenues and profits. In addition, we may engage in hedging transactions that if not successful, could result in losses.\nSee Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Risk Management within Part II, Item 7. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nA credit-rating agency downgrade could significantly impact our business.\nMaintaining an investment grade credit rating is important to our business and financial condition. If our credit ratings were downgraded, or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged, which could adversely affect our client relationships. Additionally, we intend to access the capital markets and issue debt securities from time to time, and a decrease in our credit ratings or outlook could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, decrease demand for our debt securities and increase the expense and difficulty of financing our operations. In addition, in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contract arrangements and certain other trading arrangements, we may be required to provide additional collateral to counterparties, exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Such a downgrade could also negatively impact the prices of our debt securities. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in or the discontinuance of Interbank Offered Rates (\u201cIBORs\u201d), in particular, London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d).\nCentral banks and regulators in a number of major jurisdictions (for example, the U.S., U.K., European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), Switzerland and Japan) have convened working groups to find, and implement the transition to, suitable replacements for IBORs. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that, after specified dates, LIBOR settings will cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative of the underlying market and economic reality that such settings are intended to measure. Those dates are: (i) June 30, 2023, in the case of the principal U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors (overnight and one, three, six and 12 months); and (ii) December 31, 2021, in all other cases (i.e., one week and two month U.S. dollar LIBOR and all tenors of non-U.S. dollar LIBOR). Accordingly, many existing LIBOR obligations will transition to another benchmark after June 30, 2023 or, in some cases, after December 31, 2021. However, those transition dates may occur earlier. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and certain U.S. regulators have encouraged market participants to cease entering into new contracts using U.S. dollar LIBOR by December 31, 2021, despite expected publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR through June 30, 2023. Regulators have also stated that, for certain purposes, market participants should transition away from U.S. dollar LIBOR sooner. It is not possible to know what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may have on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. Similar developments have occurred with respect to other IBORs.\nWe continue to work towards reducing our exposure to IBOR-referencing contracts, including derivatives, securities, and other financial products, to meet the industry milestones and recommendations published by National Working Groups (\u201cNWG\u201d), including the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the \u201cARRC\u201d) in the U.S.\nOn October 23, 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (\u201cISDA\u201d) published a new supplement to the ISDA 2006 definitions and the related 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (the \u201cProtocol\u201d). These publications are intended to facilitate the incorporation of robust rate fallback provisions into both legacy and new derivative contracts with effect from January 25, 2021. A significant portion of our derivative exposures have incorporated the Protocol.\nOur centralized LIBOR transition program continues to make progress with a focus on:\n\u2022continuing to reduce our overall exposure to LIBOR,\n\u2022implementing rate fallback provisions in new LIBOR contracts, where appropriate,\n\u2022continuing to educate and inform clients on LIBOR transition and the necessity to prepare for the cessation of LIBOR,\n\u2022assisting clients with discontinuing their issuance or use of LIBOR-linked products within the timelines specified by NWGs,\n\u2022supporting clients in their efforts to remediate contracts linked to LIBOR, including contracts to which we are a party, and\n\u2022planning for the implementation of rate fallback mechanisms across products based on the conventions recommended by NWGs upon the cessation of various IBORs.\nUncertainty regarding IBORs and the taking of discretionary actions or negotiation of rate fallback provisions could result in pricing volatility, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, compliance, legal and operational costs and risks associated with client disclosures, as well as systems disruption, model disruption and other business continuity issues. In addition, uncertainty relating to IBORs could result in increased capital requirements for us given potential low transaction volumes, a lack of liquidity or limited observability for exposures linked to IBORs or any emerging successor rates and operational incidents associated with changes in and the discontinuance of IBORs.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe language in our contracts and financial instruments that define IBORs, in particular LIBOR, have developed over time and have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. If a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments often give the calculation agent (which may be us) discretion over the successor rate or benchmark to be selected. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the discontinuance of designated rates in contracts and financial instruments or such designated rates ceasing to be acceptable reference rates. This uncertainty could ultimately result in client disputes and litigation surrounding the proper interpretation of our IBOR-based contracts and financial instruments. Although we have adhered to the Protocol, it is applicable only to derivatives when both parties adhere to the Protocol or otherwise agree for it to apply to their derivatives.\nFurther, the discontinuation of an IBOR, changes in an IBOR or changes in market acceptance of any IBOR as a reference rate may also adversely affect the yield on loans or securities held by us, amounts paid on securities we have issued, amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into, the value of such loans, securities or derivative instruments, the trading market for securities, the terms of new loans being made using different or modified reference rates, our ability to effectively use derivative instruments to manage risk, or the availability or cost of our floating-rate funding and our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent for liquidity from payments from our subsidiaries, many of which are subject to restrictions.\nAs a holding company, we depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund payments on our obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to regulation that restrict dividend payments or reduce the availability of the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to us. In addition, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital requirements.\nEconomic Environment Risks\nThe effects of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) have negatively affected the global economy, the United States economy and the global financial markets, and may disrupt our operations and our clients\u2019 operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption in the international and United States economies and financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 remain challenging to predict due to multiple uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity, duration and resurgences of the outbreak; new virus variants and the potential extent of their spread; the application and effectiveness of health and safety measures that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, including vaccines and treatments; the speed and strength of an economic recovery; and the impact to our employees and our operations, our clients\u2019 operations, suppliers and business partners. Impacts to our business could be widespread and global, and material impacts may be possible, including the following:\n\u2022Employees contracting COVID-19\n\u2022Reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home or disaster-recovery locations\n\u2022Unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities\n\u2022Unprecedented volatility in global financial markets\n\u2022Reductions in revenue across our operating businesses\n\u2022Closure of our offices or the offices of our clients\n\u2022De-globalization\n\u2022Potential regulatory scrutiny of our ability to adequately supervise our activities in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements\n\u2022Risk of cyber attacks or security vulnerabilities due to remote work environments and other changes in our operations\nWe are taking necessary and recommended precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees and clients, including by means of conducting certain business activities and operations remotely. However, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be deemed to be adequate or appropriate, nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employees\u2019 ability to provide client support and service. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business.\nAlthough the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in meaningfully lower stock prices for many companies, as well as the trading prices for our own securities, the markets have not only stabilized but returned to near pre-COVID-19 levels. However, the further spread of the COVID-19 outbreak may materially negatively impact stock and other securities prices and materially disrupt banking and other financial activity generally and in the areas in which we operate. This could likely result in a decline\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nin demand for our products and services, which would negatively impact our liquidity position and our growth strategy. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our and our consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 business, operations, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations.\nWe may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, cybersecurity incidents and events, terrorist attacks, climate-related incidents, or other natural disasters.\nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, or other widespread health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), cybersecurity incidents and events, terrorist attacks, extreme climate-related incidents or events or other natural disasters, could create economic and financial disruptions, and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair our ability to manage our businesses.\nClimate change concerns and incidents could disrupt our businesses, adversely affect the profitability of certain of our investments, adversely affect client activity levels, adversely affect the creditworthiness of our counterparties, and damage our reputation.\nClimate change may cause extreme weather events that disrupt operations at one or more of our locations, which may negatively affect our ability to service and interact with our clients, and also may adversely affect the value of certain of our investments, including our real estate investments. Climate change may also have a negative impact on the financial condition of our clients, which may decrease revenues from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients. Additionally, our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our involvement, or our clients\u2019 involvement, in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. New regulations or guidance relating to climate change, as well as the perspectives of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding climate change, may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we engage in certain activities or offer certain products.\nAbrupt changes in market and general economic conditions have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business and profitability and cause volatility in our results of operations.\nEconomic and market conditions have had, and will continue to have, a direct and material impact on our results of operations and financial condition because performance in the financial services industry is heavily influenced by the overall strength of general economic conditions and financial market activity.\nOur investment banking revenue, in the form of advisory services and underwriting, is directly related to general economic conditions and corresponding financial market activity. When the outlook for such economic conditions is uncertain or negative, financial market activity generally tends to decrease, which reduces our investment banking revenues. Reduced expectations of U.S. economic growth or a decline in the global economic outlook could cause financial market activity to decrease and negatively affect our investment banking revenues.\nA sustained and continuing market downturn could lead to or exacerbate declines in the number of securities transactions executed for clients and, therefore, to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads. Correspondingly, a reduction of prices of the securities we hold in inventory or as investments would lead to reduced revenues.\nRevenues from our asset management businesses have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by declining securities prices, as well as widely fluctuating securities prices. Because our asset management businesses hold long and short positions in equity and debt securities, changes in the prices of these securities, as well as any decrease in the liquidity of these securities, may materially and adversely affect our revenues from asset management.\nIn addition, global economic conditions and global financial markets remain vulnerable to the potential risks posed by certain events, which could include, among other things, political and financial uncertainty in the United States and the European Union, ongoing concern about Asia\u2019s economies, global supply disruptions, complications involving terrorism and armed conflicts around the world, or other challenges to global trade or travel, such as those that have occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More generally, because our business is closely correlated to the general economic outlook, a significant deterioration in that outlook or realization of certain events would likely have an immediate and significant negative impact on our business and overall results of operations.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nChanging financial, economic and political conditions could result in decreased revenues, losses or other adverse consequences.\nBecause we are a global securities and investment banking firm, global or regional changes in the financial markets or economic and political conditions could adversely affect our business in many ways, including the following:\n\u2022A market downturn could lead to a decline in the volume of transactions executed for customers and, therefore, to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads\n\u2022Unfavorable conditions or changes in general political, economic or market conditions could reduce the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting, financial advisory and other services. Our investment banking revenues, in the form of financial advisory and sales and trading or placement fees, are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate and could therefore be adversely affected by unfavorable financial, economic or political conditions. In particular, the increasing trend toward sovereign protectionism and de-globalization has resulted or could result in decreases in free trade, erosion of traditional international coalitions, the imposition of sanctions and tariffs, governmental closures and no-confidence votes, domestic and international strife, and general market upheaval in response to such results, all of which could negatively impact our business\n\u2022Adverse changes in the securities markets could lead to a reduction in revenues from asset management fees and losses on our own capital invested in managed funds. Even in the absence of a market downturn, below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could reduce asset management revenues and assets under management and result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors\n\u2022Adverse changes in the financial markets could lead to regulatory restrictions that may limit or halt certain of our business activities\n\u2022Limitations on the availability of credit can affect our ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Global market and economic conditions have been particularly disrupted and volatile in the last several years and may be in the future. Our cost and availability of funding could be affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads\n\u2022New or increased taxes on compensation payments such as bonuses may adversely affect our profits\n\u2022Should one of our clients or competitors fail, our business prospects and revenue could be negatively impacted due to negative market sentiment causing clients to cease doing business with us and our lenders to cease loaning us money, which could adversely affect our business, funding and liquidity\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU could adversely affect our business.\nThe U.K. left the EU on January 31, 2020, with a transition period until December 31, 2020 during which time the U.K. followed EU rules and a U.K.-EU trade agreement was negotiated governing EU and U.K. relations from January 1, 2021 resulting in a Trade and Cooperation Agreement together with a Political Declaration covering a number of areas including financial services. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not include substantive provisions for financial services, in particular it does not allow U.K. investment firms to provide services into the EU under the Passporting regime.\nWe historically operated substantial parts of our EU businesses from entities based in the U.K. As a result, services to clients located in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) jurisdiction are now provided by a wholly-owned subsidiary (\u201cJefferies GmbH\u201d) established in Germany which is authorized as a MiFID investment firm by BaFin. Client relationships have been migrated so that Jefferies GmbH can service EEA institutional clients across Investment Banking, Equities and Fixed Income sectors from its office in Frankfurt and branch offices in other EEA countries. Due to considerations such as operating expenses, liquidity, leverage and capital, the modified European operating framework will be more complex, less efficient and more costly than would otherwise have been the case, which could have an adverse impact on our businesses, results of operations and our ability to service clients. In addition, the potential impacts related to, among other things, the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU, the terms of the new economic and security relationship between the U.K. and the EU on the movement of goods, services, people and capital between the U.K. and the EU, customer behavior, economic conditions, interest rates, currency exchange rates, availability of capital or other matters are unclear and likely to change over time. The overall impact of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU on any one or more factors, or more generally, could adversely affect our businesses, our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenues from trading and investment banking activities, particularly in Europe. We are continuing to monitor the impact of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU on our businesses, our results of operations and financial condition.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOperational Risks\nDamage to our reputation could damage our business.\nMaintaining our reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees. If we fail to deal with, or appear to fail to deal with, various issues that may give rise to reputational risk, we could significantly harm our business prospects. These issues include, but are not limited to, any of the risks discussed in this Item 1A, appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest, legal and regulatory requirements, ethical issues, money-laundering, cybersecurity and privacy, record keeping, sales and trading practices, failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels, and the proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our products. A failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to our reputation. Further, negative publicity regarding us, whether or not true, may also result in harm to our prospects. Our operations in the past have been impacted as some clients either ceased doing business or temporarily slowed down the level of business they do, thereby decreasing our revenue. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully reverse the negative impact of allegations and rumors in the future and our potential failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may incur losses if our risk management is not effective.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure. Our risk management processes and procedures are designed to limit our exposure to acceptable levels as we conduct our business. We apply a comprehensive framework of limits on a variety of key metrics to constrain the risk profile of our business activities. These limits reflect our risk tolerances for business activity. Our framework includes inventory position and exposure limits on a gross and net basis, scenario analysis and stress tests, Value-at-Risk, sensitivities, exposure concentrations, aged inventory, amount of Level 3 assets, counterparty exposure, leverage, cash capital and performance analysis. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management within Part II. Item 7. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion. While we employ various risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application, including risk tolerance determinations, cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. As a result, we may incur losses notwithstanding our risk management processes and procedures.\nThe ability to attract, develop and retain highly skilled and productive employees is critical to the success of our business.\nOur ability to develop and retain our clients depends on the reputation, judgment, business generation capabilities and skills of our professionals. To compete effectively, we must attract, retain and motivate qualified professionals, including successful financial advisors, investment bankers, trading professionals, portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel, in addition to qualified, successful personnel in functional, non-revenue producing roles. Competitive pressures we experience with respect to employees could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nTurnover in the financial services industry is high. The cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably. Financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts, upfront payments, and increased compensation. These can be important factors in a current employee\u2019s decision to leave us as well as in a prospective employee\u2019s decision to join us. As competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense, we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nIf we were to lose the services of certain of our professionals, we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services. If we are unable to retain our professionals or recruit additional professionals, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. Further, new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses frequently require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenues.\nMoreover, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors often claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices. We may be subject to such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel who have worked for our competitors. Some of these claims may result in material litigation. We could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims, regardless of their merits. Such claims could also discourage potential employees who work for our competitors from joining us.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOperational risks may disrupt our business, result in regulatory action against us or limit our growth.\nOur businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies, and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. If any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume and complexity of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses.\nCertain of our financial and other data processing systems rely on access to and the functionality of operating systems maintained by third-parties. If the accounting, trading or other data processing systems on which we are dependent are unable to meet increasingly demanding standards for processing and security or, if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be adversely affected. Such consequences may include our inability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk.\nIn addition, despite the contingency plans we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or third-parties with which we conduct business.\nAny cyber attack, cybersecurity incident, or other information security breach of, or vulnerability in, our technology systems, or those of our clients, partners, counterparties, or other third-party service providers we rely on, could have operational impacts, subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation.\nOur operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of financial, personal and other information in our computer systems and networks. In recent years, there have been several highly publicized incidents involving financial services companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or other confidential information, as well as cyber attacks involving theft, dissemination and destruction of corporate information or other assets, which in some cases occurred as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third-parties. Cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources, including third-parties affiliated with foreign governments, organized crime or terrorist organizations, and malicious individuals both outside and inside a targeted company. Malicious actors may also attempt to compromise or induce our induce employees, clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data, and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent.\nLike other financial services firms, we and our third-party service providers have been the target of cyber attacks. Although we and our service providers regularly defend against, respond to and mitigate the risks of cyberattacks, cybersecurity incidents among financial services firms and industry generally are on the rise. We are not aware of any material losses we have incurred relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches. The techniques and malware used in these cyber attacks and cybersecurity incidents are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched because they are novel. Although we monitor the changing cybersecurity risk environment and seek to maintain reasonable security measures, including a suite of authentication and layered information security controls, no security measures are infallible, and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will always work or that they will detect, mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner. Despite our implementation of reasonable security measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to spam attacks, unauthorized access, distributed denial of service attacks, ransomware, computer viruses and other malicious code, as well as human error, natural disaster, power loss, and other events that could damage to our reputation, impact the security and stability of our operations, and expose us to class action lawsuits and regulatory investigation, action, and penalties, and significant liability.\nWe also rely on numerous third-party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations, and we face similar risks relating to them. While we evaluate the information security programs and defenses of third-party vendors, we cannot be certain that our reviews and oversight will identify all potential information security weaknesses, or that our vendors\u2019 information security protocols are or will be sufficient to withstand or adequately respond to a cyber attack, cybersecurity incident, or other information security breach. In addition, in order to access our products and services, or trade with us, our customers and counterparties may use networks, computers and other devices that are beyond our security control systems and processes.\nNotwithstanding the precautions we take, if a cyber attack, cybersecurity incident, or other information security breach were to occur, this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain, or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations or those of our clients and counterparties, exposing us to liability. As attempted attacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication, we may be required to expend substantial additional resources to modify or enhance our reasonable security\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nmeasures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to communicate about cyber attacks, cybersecurity incidents, or other information security breaches to our customers, partners, third-party service providers, and counterparties. Though we have insurance against some cyber risks and attacks, we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our insurance policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies. A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators. Successful cyber attacks, cybersecurity incidents, or other information security breaches at other large financial institutions or other market participants, whether or not we are affected, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our reasonable security measures or the financial system in general, which could result in a loss of business.\nFurther, in light of the high volume of transactions we process, the large number of our clients, partners and counterparties, and the increasing sophistication of malicious actors, a cyber attack, cybersecurity incident, or other information security breach could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection. We expect that any investigation of a cyber attack, cybersecurity incident, or other information security breach would take substantial amounts of time and resources, and that there may be extensive delays before we obtain full and reliable information. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, cybersecurity incident, or other information security breach or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. All of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of such a cyber attack or cybersecurity incident. In providing services to clients, we manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data, including personal data. As a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as U.S. and non-U.S. federal and state laws governing privacy and cybersecurity. If any person, including any of our associates, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution. In addition, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data, whether through system compromise or failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and related revenue. Depending on the circumstances giving rise to the information security breach, this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nThere is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position, current client relationships and ability to attract future clients. We are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business. In addition, our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity, providing financial planning, investment advice, and discretionary asset management. The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees would adversely affect our clients and us. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective against certain misconduct, including conduct which is difficult to detect. The occurrence of significant employee misconduct could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm and/or legal and regulatory liability, which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects.\nOur investment in Jefferies Finance may not prove to be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nMany factors, most of which are outside of our control, can affect Jefferies Finance\u2019s business, including adverse investment banking and capital market conditions leading to a decline of syndicate loans, inability of borrowers to repay commitments, adverse changes to a borrower\u2019s credit worthiness, and other factors that directly and indirectly effect the results of operations, and consequently may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investment in Berkadia may not prove to be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nMany factors, most of which are outside of our control, can affect Berkadia\u2019s business, including loan losses in excess of reserves, a change in the relationships with U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises or federal agencies, a significant loss of customers, and other factors that directly and indirectly effect the results of operations, including the sales and profitability of Berkadia, and consequently may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLegal, Legislation and Regulation Risks\nNewly introduced legislation and regulation may significantly affect our business.\nSignificant new legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry is regularly proposed and sometimes adopted. These legislative and regulatory initiatives affect not only us, but also our competitors and certain of our clients. These changes could have an effect on our revenue and profitability, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, impact the value of assets that we hold, require us to change certain business practices, impose additional costs on us and otherwise adversely affect our business. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that legislation and regulation will not eventually have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In the U.S., such initiatives frequently arise in the aftermath of elections that change the party of the president or the majority party in the House and/or Senate.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and the rules and regulations adopted by the CFTC and the SEC have introduced a comprehensive regulatory regime for swaps and SBS and parties that deal in such derivatives. One of our subsidiaries is registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC and is a member of the NFA, is registered as a security-based swap dealer with the SEC and has applied to the SEC to register as an OTC Derivatives Dealer. We have incurred significant compliance and operational costs as a result of the swaps and SBS rules adopted by the CFTC and SEC pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, and we expect that the complex regulatory framework will continue to require significant monitoring and compliance expenditures. We also will become subject to the SEC\u2019s rules with respect to OTC Derivative Dealers if our subsidiary\u2019s application to register as an OTC Derivatives Dealer is approved. Negative effects could result from an expansive extraterritorial application of the Dodd-Frank Act and/or insufficient international coordination with respect to adoption of rules for derivatives and other financial reforms in other jurisdictions.\nSimilar types of swap regulation have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S., including in the EU, the U.K. and Japan. For example, the EU and the U.K. have established regulatory requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation and reporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and margining for uncleared derivatives activities under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (\u201cEMIR\u201d).\nThe Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation and a revision of the Market in Financial Instruments Directive (collectively referred to as \u201cMiFID II\u201d) imposes certain restrictions as to the trading of shares and derivatives including market structure-related, reporting, investor protection-related and organizational requirements, requirements on pre- and post-trade transparency, requirements to use certain venues when trading financial instruments (which includes shares and certain derivative instruments), requirements affecting the way investment managers can obtain research, powers of regulators to impose position limits and provisions on regulatory sanctions. The EU published amended rules in August 2021, which include investor protection rules and rules relating to research on small and medium sized enterprises, effective in 2022.\nThe EU capital and liquidity legislation for banks implemented many of the finalized Basel III capital and liquidity standards, including in relation to the leverage ratio, market risk capital, and a net stable funding ratio. Certain of these changes began to be phased in from June 2021, and further changes will be required to be implemented from 2023. In addition, new prudential regimes for investment firms are in the process of being implemented in both the EU and the UK for MiFID authorized investment firms. The Investment Firms Regulation (IFR) and the Investment Firms Directive (IFD), being applicable to the UK and Europe, whilst simplifying the capital treatment for investments firms such as the UK entity, Jefferies International Limited, and, its European subsidiary, Jefferies GmbH, will include a requirement that a certain amount of variable remuneration for material risk takers be paid in non-cash instruments and have a deferral element. Implementation of this requirement is effective from the financial year commencing December 1, 2022 for Jefferies International Limited and December 1, 2021 for Jefferies GmbH (although the European implementation timeline for Jefferies GmbH could be delayed by the German regulator, resulting in a commencement date of December 1, 2022, being in line with the UK). Consequently, we will need to adapt our remuneration structures for those employees identified as material risk takers.\nIncreasing regulatory focus on evolving privacy and security issues and expanding laws could impact our businesses and investments and expose us to increased liability.\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cEU GDPR\u201d or \u201cGDPR\u201d) applies in all EU Member States and also applies to entities established outside of the EU where such entity processes personal data in relation to: (i) the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA; or (ii) monitoring the behavior of data subjects as far as that behavior takes place in the EEA. The UK has implemented the GDPR as part of its national law (referred to as the \u201cUK GDPR\u201d). The GDPR imposes a number of obligations on companies, including, without limitation: accountability and transparency requirements; compliance with the data protection rights of data subjects; and the prompt reporting of certain personal data breaches to both (1) the relevant data supervisory authority without undue delay unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms; and (2) impacted individuals where the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk with regard to their rights and freedoms.\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe EU GDPR also includes restrictions on the transfers of personal data from the EEA to jurisdictions that are not recognized as having \u2018adequate data protection laws\u2019. Obligations under the EU GDPR and implementing Member State legislation continue to evolve through legislation and regulatory guidance, for example imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d) to transfer data to third countries by requiring companies to carry out a transfer privacy impact assessment.\nThe EU GDPR imposes significant fines for serious non-compliance of up to the higher of 4% of an organization\u2019s annual worldwide turnover or \u20ac20 million (or approximately \u00a317.5 million under the UK GDPR). The EU GDPR identifies a list of points to consider when determining the level of fines to impose (including the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement). Data subjects also have a right to compensation as a result of infringement of the EU GDPR for financial or non-financial losses.\nFollowing the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the EU, known as Brexit, the EU GDPR\u2019s data protection obligations continue to apply in the United Kingdom in substantially unvaried form under \u201cUK GDPR\u201d. The UK GDPR exists alongside the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and its requirements are largely aligned with those under the EU GDPR and as such, may lead to similar compliance and operational costs with potential fines of up to \u00a317.5 million or 4% of global turnover.\nOther privacy laws at both federal and state levels are in effect in the U.S. and other regions, many of which involve heightened compliance obligations similar to those under GDPR. The privacy and cybersecurity legislative and regulatory landscape is evolving rapidly, and numerous proposals regarding privacy and cybersecurity are pending before U.S. and non-U.S. legislative and regulatory bodies. The adopted form of such developing legislation and regulation will determine the level of any resources which we will need to invest to ensure compliance. In the event of non-compliance with privacy laws and regulations, we could face significant administrative and monetary sanctions as well as reputational damage which may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and prospects.\nExtensive regulation of our business limits our activities, and, if we violate these regulations, we may be subject to significant penalties.\nWe are subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Firms that engage in providing financial services must comply with the laws, rules and regulations imposed by national and state governments and regulatory and self-regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over such activities. Such laws, rules and regulations cover many aspects of providing financial services.\nOur regulators supervise our business activities to monitor compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. In addition, if there are instances in which our regulators question our compliance with laws, rules, or regulations, they may investigate the facts and circumstances to determine whether we have complied. At any moment in time, we may be subject to one or more such investigations or similar reviews. At this time, all such investigations and similar reviews are insignificant in scope and immaterial to us. However, there can be no assurance that, in the future, the operations of our businesses will not violate such laws, rules, or regulations, or that such investigations and similar reviews will not result in significant or material adverse regulatory requirements, regulatory enforcement actions, fines or other adverse impact to the operation of our business.\nAdditionally, violations of laws, rules and regulations could subject us to one or more of the following events: civil and criminal liability; sanctions, which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries\u2019 registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers; the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors; censures; fines; or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory financial capital holding requirements, that could impact various capital allocation decisions or limit the operations of our broker-dealers. In particular, compliance with the financial capital holding requirement may restrict our broker-dealers\u2019 ability to engage in capital-intensive activities such as underwriting and trading, and may also limit their ability to make loans, advances, dividends and other payments and may restrict our swap dealers\u2019 ability to execute certain derivative transactions.\nAdditional legislation, changes in rules, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, conflicts and inconsistencies among rules and regulations, or the entering into businesses that subject us to new rules and regulations may directly affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continue to monitor the impact of new U.S. and international regulation on our businesses.\nLegal liability may harm our business.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability, and in the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant or codefendant in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages. The risks associated with potential legal liabilities often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The expansion of our business, including increases in the number and size of investment banking transactions\nJEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nand our expansion into new areas impose greater risks of liability. Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects.\nA change in tax laws in key jurisdictions could materially increase our tax expense.\nWe are subject to tax in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, or the introduction of new taxes, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities and otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our tax filing positions were to be challenged by federal, state and local, or foreign tax jurisdictions, we may not be wholly successful in defending our tax filing positions.\nWe record reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on our assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be recorded and, if so, estimating the amount. If our tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts or we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of our net deferred tax asset, either of which result could be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 86804, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "LUK2"}
