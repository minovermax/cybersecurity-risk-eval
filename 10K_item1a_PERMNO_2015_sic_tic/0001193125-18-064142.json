{"cik": "1580905", "company": "Installed Building Products, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are a number of business risks and uncertainties that affect our business. These risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results. We consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our business activities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may also adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur business is cyclical and significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions.\nDemand for our services is cyclical and highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions over which we have no control, including changes in:\n\u2022\nthe number of new home and commercial building construction starts;\n\u2022\nshort- and long-term interest rates;\n\u2022\ninflation;\n\u2022\nemployment levels and job and personal income growth;\n\u2022\nhousing demand from population growth, household formation and other demographic changes;\n\u2022\nthe length of building cycles from permit to completion, based on local economic or environmental factors;\n\u2022\navailability and pricing of mortgage financing for homebuyers and commercial financing for developers of multi-family homes and subcontractors;\n\u2022\nconsumer confidence generally and the confidence of potential homebuyers in particular;\n\u2022\nU.S. and global financial and political system and credit market stability;\n\u2022\nprivate party and government mortgage loan programs and federal and state regulation, oversight and legal action regarding lending, appraisal, foreclosure and short sale practices;\n\u2022\nfederal and state personal income tax rates and provisions, including provisions for the deduction of mortgage loan interest payments, state and local income and real estate taxes and other expenses; and\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local energy efficiency programs, regulations, codes and standards.\nFor example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 limits homeowners\u2019 ability to deduct mortgage interest, property taxes and state and local income taxes. Unfavorable changes in any of the above conditions could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes and adversely affect our business generally or be more prevalent or concentrated in particular markets in which we operate. Any deterioration in economic conditions or continuation of uncertain economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe housing market has faced significant challenges in the past which could return and/or intensify.\nThe homebuilding industry is still recovering from a significant downturn that began in mid-2006 and began to stabilize in late 2011. The housing market has steadily strengthened since then. In 2017, U.S. homebuilding activity increased to approximately 849 thousand single-family starts although it remains well below the historical average (from 1959 through 2017) of approximately 1.0 million to 1.1 million single-family starts per year. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, actual U.S. single family housing starts in the U.S. during 2017 were 81% lower than in 2007. The factors that may be contributing to a slow recovery may include: a severe economic recession, followed by a gradual economic recovery; limited credit availability; shortages of suitable building lots in many regions; shortages of experienced labor; rising home prices in many markets resulting in affordability issues for potential buyers; and soft housing demand in certain markets. The downturn in the homebuilding industry resulted in a substantial reduction in demand for our products and services. These challenges could return and/or intensify and limit any future improvement in the levels and mix of new home construction activity, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business relies on commercial construction activity, which has faced significant challenges and is dependent on business investment.\nA portion of the products we sell are for the commercial construction market. Challenging economic conditions in recent years have adversely affected demand for commercial construction projects. Although demand is now improving, current market estimates indicate that commercial construction activity remains uneven and below historical average levels. If the present recovery does not continue or gain further momentum, the growth potential of our business, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe strength of the commercial construction market depends on business investment which is a function of many national, regional and local economic conditions beyond our control, including capital and credit availability for commercial construction projects, material costs, interest rates, employment rates, vacancy rates, labor and healthcare costs, fuel and other energy costs and changes in tax laws affecting the real estate industry. Adverse changes or continued uncertainty regarding these and other economic conditions could result in a decline or postponement in spending on commercial construction projects, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe downturn from 2008 to 2011 in the U.S. commercial new construction market was one of the most severe of the last 40 years. Previously, downturns in the construction industry have typically lasted about two to three years, but the downturn from 2008 to 2011 was much more significant, with a market decline of approximately 49% during those three years. We cannot predict the duration of the current market conditions or the timing or strength of any future recovery of commercial construction activity in our markets. Weakness in the commercial construction market would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Continued uncertainty about current economic conditions will continue to pose a risk to our businesses that serve the non-residential markets. If participants in these industries postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values or other factors, this could have a material negative effect on the demand for our products and services and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in the economy and/or a deterioration in expectations regarding the housing market or the commercial construction market could cause us to record significant non-cash impairment charges, which could negatively affect our earnings and reduce stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAnnually, we either assess qualitative factors or perform a detailed analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2017, 2016, or 2015; however, a decline in the expectation of our future performance or deterioration in expectations regarding the general economy and/or the timing and the extent of new home construction and home improvement and commercial construction activity may cause us to recognize non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill or other long-lived assets, which are not determinable at this time. In addition, as a result of our acquisition strategy, we have recorded goodwill and may incur impairment charges in connection with prior and future acquisitions. If the value of goodwill or other intangible assets is impaired, our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity would be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had goodwill and other intangible assets in an aggregate amount of $293.5 million, or approximately 40% of our total assets. Current year acquisitions, including the acquisition of Alpha in January 2017, have resulted in a significant increase in our goodwill and other intangible assets. We review our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. A significant decrease in our estimates for income and cash flows or a decline in our market capitalization could result in an impairment of our goodwill and/or other intangible assets. Given the significant increase in the amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets after completion of the Alpha acquisition, any future impairment of these assets could require us to record material charges that would negatively impact our earnings and reduce stockholders\u2019 equity.\nOur business may be affected by severe weather conditions and is seasonal.\nSevere weather conditions, such as unusually prolonged cold conditions, rain, blizzards or hurricanes, could accelerate, delay or halt construction or installation activity. The impact of these types of events on our business may adversely impact quarterly or annual net revenue, cash flows from operations and results of operations.\nWe tend to have higher sales during the second half of the year as our homebuilder customers complete construction of homes placed under contract for sale in the traditionally stronger spring selling season. In addition, some of our larger branches operate in states impacted by winter weather and, as such, experience a slowdown in construction activity during inclement months. This winter slowdown contributes to traditionally lower sales and profitability in our first quarter.\nOur industry is highly fragmented and competitive, and increased competitive pressure may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe building products installation industry is highly fragmented and competitive. We face significant competition from other national, regional and local companies. Any of these competitors may: (i) foresee the\ncourse of market development more accurately than we do; (ii) offer services that are deemed superior to ours; (iii) install building products at a lower cost; (iv) develop stronger relationships with homebuilders and suppliers; (v) adapt more quickly to new technologies, new installation techniques or evolving customer requirements; or (vi) have access to financing on more favorable terms than we can obtain in the market. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with them. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIn the event that increased demand leads to higher prices for the products we install, we may have limited, if any, ability to pass on price increases in a timely manner or at all due to the fragmented and competitive nature of our industry.\nProduct shortages or the loss of key suppliers could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers depends on our ability to obtain adequate product supply from manufacturers. We do not typically enter into long-term agreements with our suppliers but have done so from time to time. We have certain agreements that do not qualify as supply agreements due to a lack of a fixed price and/or lack of a fixed and determinable purchase quantity, but nonetheless may require us to purchase certain of our products from certain vendors, depending on the specific circumstances. Generally, our products are available from various sources and in sufficient quantities to meet our operating needs. However, the loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, unexpected events, such as incapacitation of supplier facilities due to extreme weather or fire, have temporarily reduced manufacturing capacity and production. In addition, during prior economic downturns in the housing industry, manufacturers have reduced capacity by closing plants and production lines within plants. Even if such capacity reductions are not permanent, there may be a delay in manufacturers\u2019 ability to increase capacity in times of rising demand. If the demand for products from manufacturers and other suppliers exceeds the available supply, we may be unable to source additional products in sufficient quantity or quality in a timely manner and the prices for the products that we install could rise. These developments could affect our ability to take advantage of market opportunities and limit our growth prospects. We continually evaluate our supplier relationships and at any given time may move some or all of our purchases from one or more of our suppliers. There can be no assurance that any such action would have its intended effect.\nFailure by our suppliers to continue to provide us with products on commercially favorable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows. Our inability to source materials in a timely manner could also damage our relationships with our customers.\nChanges in the costs of the products we install can decrease our profit margins.\nThe principal building products that we install have been subject to price changes in the past, some of which have been significant. Our results of operations for individual quarterly periods can be, and have been, adversely affected by a delay between when building product cost increases are implemented and when we are able to increase prices for our products and services, if at all. Our supplier purchase prices often depend on volume requirements. If we do not meet these volume requirements, our costs could increase and our margins may be adversely affected. In addition, while we have been able to achieve cost savings through volume purchasing and our relationships with suppliers, we may not be able to continue to receive advantageous pricing for the products that we install, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions.\nAcquisitions are a core part of our strategy and we may be unable to continue to grow our business through acquisitions. We may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates and may face increased\ncompetition for these acquisition candidates. In addition, acquired businesses may not perform in accordance with expectations, and our business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of acquired businesses may not prove to be correct. We may also be unable to achieve expected improvements or achievements in businesses that we acquire. At any given time, including currently, we may be evaluating or in discussions with one or more acquisition candidates, including entering into non-binding letters of intent. The value of our common stock following the completion of an acquisition could be adversely affected if we are unable to realize the expected benefits from the acquisition on a timely basis or at all. Future acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, legal liabilities, goodwill impairments, increased interest expense and amortization expense and significant integration costs. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilution of existing stockholders if we issue shares of common stock as consideration.\nAcquisitions involve a number of special risks, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to manage acquired businesses or control integration costs and other costs relating to acquisitions;\n\u2022\npotential adverse short-term effects on operating results from increased costs, business disruption or otherwise;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\nloss of suppliers, customers or other significant business partners of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain existing key personnel of the acquired business and recruit qualified new employees at the location;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully implement infrastructure, logistics and systems integration;\n\u2022\npotential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with the internal controls of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nexposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition and inability to realize on any indemnification claims, including with respect to environmental and immigration claims;\n\u2022\nthe risks inherent in the systems of the acquired business and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities; and\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain financing necessary to complete acquisitions on attractive terms or at all.\nOur strategy could be impeded if we do not identify, or face increased competition for, suitable acquisition candidates and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected if any of the foregoing factors were to occur.\nWe may be unable to continue to realize the expected benefits of our acquisition of Alpha.\nOn January 5, 2017, we closed the acquisition of Alpha, our largest acquisition to date. Our expectations regarding the benefits of the Alpha acquisition were necessarily based on estimates and assumptions about the combined businesses, which may not materialize as we expect or which may prove to be inaccurate. The value of our common stock and results of our operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to realize the expected benefits from the acquisition within the expected timeframe or at all. As we continue to work to integrate Alpha into our business, we may face unexpected operational, strategic, financial or administrative challenges, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully manage our increased business in the commercial construction end market;\n\u2022\ndifficulties incorporating Alpha into our existing internal control over financial reporting due to material weaknesses and significant deficiencies identified in Alpha\u2019s internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\ndiscovery of material misstatements in the historical financial statements of Alpha resulting from material weaknesses and/or significant deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nloss of employees, suppliers, customers or other significant business partners of Alpha as well as business disruption; and\n\u2022\nan increase in our financing costs as a result of the indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the acquisition.\nOur continued expansion into the commercial construction end market following our acquisition of Alpha could affect our margins, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nFollowing the completion of the Alpha acquisition, our revenues derived from the commercial construction end market have significantly increased on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our total revenues. While we expect such growth to continue as we expand our commercial construction end market business, we may face new or unexpected competitive, operational, financial and accounting challenges and other risks that differ from our current business and existing operations. For example, the typical contractual terms and arrangements and billing cycle for the commercial construction end market are different than the residential new construction end market. These factors and any other challenges we encounter could adversely affect our margins, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets has significantly increased as a result of our acquisition of Alpha. If our goodwill and other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we may be required to record significant non-cash impairment charges, which would negatively affect our earnings and reduce stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe may be subject to claims arising from the operations of our various businesses for periods prior to the dates we acquired them.\nWe have consummated over 125 acquisitions. We may be subject to claims or liabilities arising from the ownership or operation of acquired businesses for the periods prior to our acquisition of them, including environmental, employee-related and other liabilities and claims not covered by insurance. These claims or liabilities could be significant. Our ability to seek indemnification from the former owners of our acquired businesses for these claims or liabilities may be limited by various factors, including the specific time, monetary or other limitations contained in the respective acquisition agreements and the financial ability of the former owners to satisfy our indemnification claims. In addition, insurance companies may be unwilling to cover claims that have arisen from acquired businesses or locations, or claims may exceed the coverage limits that our acquired businesses had in effect prior to the date of acquisition. If we are unable to successfully obtain insurance coverage of third-party claims or enforce our indemnification rights against the former owners, or if the former owners are unable to satisfy their obligations for any reason, including because of their financial position, we could be held liable for the costs or obligations associated with such claims or liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our key personnel.\nOur business results depend largely upon the continued contributions of our Chief Executive Officer and other members of our management team. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers other than Jeff Edwards, our Chief Executive Officer and President. Although Mr. Edwards\u2019 employment agreement requires him to devote the amount of time necessary to conduct our business and affairs, he is also permitted to engage in other business activities that do not create a conflict of interest or substantially interfere with his service to us, including non-competitive operational activities for his real estate development business. If we lose members of our management team, our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the market price of our securities, could be adversely affected.\nOur business results also depend upon our branch managers and sales personnel, including those of companies recently acquired. While we customarily sign non-competition agreements, which typically continue for two years following the termination of employment, with our branch managers and sales personnel in order to maintain key customer relationships in our markets, such agreements do not protect us fully against competition from former employees.\nWe are dependent on attracting, training and retaining qualified employees while controlling labor costs.\nThe labor market for the construction industry is tight and we have recently experienced higher employee-related costs. We must attract, train and retain a large number of qualified employees while controlling related labor costs. We compete with other businesses for these employees. Tighter labor markets may make it even more difficult for us to hire and retain installers and control labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including competitive wage rates and health and other insurance and benefit costs. A significant increase in competition, minimum wage or overtime rates in localities where we have employees could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we take steps to mitigate such increases, all of which may cause us to incur additional costs, expend resources responding to such increases and lower our margins.\nHigher health care costs and labor costs could adversely affect our business.\nWith the passage in 2010 of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Affordable Care Act, we are required to provide affordable coverage, as defined in the Affordable Care Act, to all employees, or otherwise be subject to a payment per employee based on the affordability criteria therein. These requirements and any future legislation could cause us to experience higher health care and labor costs in the future. Additionally, some states and localities have passed state and local laws mandating the provision of certain levels of health benefits by some employers. Increased health care and insurance costs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in federal or state workplace regulations could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial targets.\nChanges in employment laws may adversely affect our business.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern the relationship with our employees and impact operating costs. These laws include:\n\u2022\nemployee classification as exempt or non-exempt for overtime and other purposes;\n\u2022\nworkers\u2019 compensation rates;\n\u2022\nimmigration status;\n\u2022\nmandatory health benefits;\n\u2022\ntax reporting; and\n\u2022\nother wage and benefit requirements.\nWe have a significant exposure to changes in laws governing our relationships with our employees, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. Significant additional government-imposed increases in the preceding areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws or enforcement programs, and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time to time consider\nand implement changes to federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs. These changes may increase our compliance and oversight obligations, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we verify the employment eligibility status of all our employees, including through participation in the \u201cE-Verify\u201d program where required, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. Use of the \u201cE-Verify\u201d program does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties and, if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized, we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees who were unauthorized employees may disrupt our operations, cause temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration laws. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if pending or future legal claims against us are not resolved in our favor.\nWe are subject to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including wage and hour lawsuits. The ultimate resolution of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties. It is possible that the costs to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows for the periods in which the matters are resolved. Similarly, if additional claims are filed against us in the future, the negative outcome of one or more of such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to product liability, workmanship warranty, casualty, negligence, construction defect, breach of contract and other claims and legal proceedings.\nWe are subject to product liability, workmanship warranty, casualty, negligence, construction defect, breach of contract and other claims and legal proceedings relating to the products we install that, if adversely determined, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with most of the products we install. Because we do not have direct control over the quality of such products manufactured or supplied by such third-party suppliers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products. In addition, we are exposed to potential claims arising from the conduct of our employees, homebuilders and other subcontractors, for which we may be contractually liable.\nWe have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to fines, penalties and other liabilities in connection with injury or damage incurred in conjunction with the installation of our products. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance, we may be unable to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or such insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities.\nProduct liability, workmanship warranty, casualty, negligence, construction defect, breach of contract and other claims and legal proceedings can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, lawsuits relating to construction defects typically have statutes of limitations that can run as long as ten years. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in us and our services. Current or future claims could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information, see Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are required to obtain performance bonds and licensing bonds, the unavailability of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe are often required to obtain performance bonds and licensing bonds to secure our performance under certain contracts and other arrangements. In addition, the commercial construction end market also requires higher levels of performance bonding.\nOur ability to obtain performance bonds and licensing bonds primarily depends on our credit rating, capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers. The ability to obtain performance bonds and licensing bonds can also be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds and licensing bonds. If we are unable to obtain performance bonds and licensing bonds when required, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nFederal, state, local and other laws and regulations could impose substantial costs and/or restrictions on our operations that would reduce our net income.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and other laws and regulations, including, among other things, worker and workplace health and safety regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT, employment regulations promulgated by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and tax regulations promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service and various other state and local tax authorities. More burdensome regulatory requirements in these or other areas may increase our expenses and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, our failure to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to our business could subject us to substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur transportation operations, which we depend on to transport materials from our locations to job sites, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the DOT. The DOT has broad administrative powers with respect to our transportation operations. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, trailer length and configuration or driver hours of service would increase our costs, which may increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows. If we fail to comply with DOT regulations or the regulations become more stringent, we could experience increased inspections, regulatory authorities could take remedial action, including imposing fines or shutting down our operations, and we could be subject to increased audit and compliance costs. We organize our transportation operations as a separate legal entity in certain states, including Ohio and Indiana, to take advantage of sales tax exemptions relating to vehicle operating costs. If legislation is enacted that modifies or eliminates these exemptions, our costs may increase. If any of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the residential construction and commercial construction industries are subject to various federal, state and local statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction, contractors\u2019 licensing, energy conservation and similar matters, including regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements on the residential new construction industry or that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Regulatory restrictions and industry standards may require us to alter our installation processes and our sourcing, increase our operating expenses and limit the availability of suitable building lots for our customers, any of which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental regulation and potential exposure to environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe that we operate our business, including each of our locations, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and\nmaintain all material permits required under such laws and regulations to operate our business, we may be held liable or incur fines or penalties in connection with such requirements. Certain types of insulation, particularly spray foam applications, require our employees to handle potentially hazardous or toxic substances. While our employees who handle these and other potentially hazardous or toxic materials, including lead-based paint, receive specialized training and wear protective clothing, there is still a risk that they, or others, may be exposed to these substances. Exposure to these substances could result in significant injury to our employees and others, including site occupants, and damage to our property or the property of others, including natural resource damage. Our personnel and others at our work sites are also at risk for other workplace-related injuries, including slips and falls. In addition, as owners and lessees of real property, we may be held liable for, among other things, hazardous or toxic substances, including asbestos or petroleum products on, at, under or emanating from currently or formerly owned or operated properties, or any off-site disposal locations, or for any known or newly discovered environmental conditions at or relating to any of our properties, including those arising from activities conducted by previous occupants or at adjoining properties, without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for such release. We may be required to investigate, remove, remediate or monitor the presence or release of such hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products. We may also be held liable for fines, penalties or damages, including for bodily injury, property damage and natural resource damage in connection with the presence or release of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products. In addition, expenditures may be required in the future as a result of releases of, or exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions or changes in environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation or enforcement and, in certain instances, such expenditures may be material.\nIncreases in union organizing activity and work stoppages could delay or reduce availability of products that we install and increase our costs.\nLess than one percent of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining or other similar labor agreements. However, if a larger number of our employees were to unionize, including in the wake of any future legislation that makes it easier for employees to unionize, our business could be negatively affected. Any inability by us to negotiate collective bargaining arrangements could cause strikes or other work stoppages, and new contracts could result in increased operating costs. If any such strikes or other work stoppages occur, or if other employees become represented by a union, we could experience a disruption of our operations and higher labor costs.\nIn addition, certain of our suppliers have unionized work forces and certain of our products are transported by unionized truckers. Strikes or work stoppages could result in slowdowns or closures of facilities where the products that we install are manufactured or could affect the ability of our suppliers to deliver such products to us. Any interruption in the production or delivery of these products could delay or reduce availability of these products and increase our costs.\nIncreases in fuel costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe price of oil has fluctuated over the last few years, creating volatility in our fuel costs. We do not currently hedge our fuel costs. Increases in fuel costs can negatively impact our cost to deliver our products to our customers and thus increase our cost of sales. If we are unable to increase the selling price of our products to our customers to cover any increases in fuel costs, net income may be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by disruptions in our information technology systems.\nOur operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, including our web-enabled internal software technology, jobCORE. The jobCORE software provides in-depth operational and financial performance data from individual branch locations to the corporate office. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage customer orders on a timely basis, coordinate our sales and installation activities across locations and manage invoicing. As a result, the proper functioning of our information technology systems is critical to the\nsuccessful operation of our business. Although our information technology systems are protected through physical and software safeguards, our information technology systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, unauthorized access, delays and outages in our service, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, telecommunication failures, computer viruses and other problems. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or installing our products on a timely basis for our customers, which could adversely affect our reputation and customer relationships.\nIn the event of a cybersecurity incident, we could experience operational interruptions, incur substantial additional costs, become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings or suffer damage to our reputation.\nIn addition to the disruptions that may occur from interruptions in our information technology systems, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks pose a risk to our information technology systems. We have established security policies, processes and defenses designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our information technology systems and information and disruption of our operations. Despite these efforts, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, computer viruses, undetected intrusion, hardware failures or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings and other costs. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation.\nWe maintain monitoring practices and protections of our information technology to reduce these risks and test our systems on an ongoing basis for potential threats. We carry cybersecurity insurance to help mitigate the financial exposure and related notification procedures in the event of intentional intrusion. There can be no assurance, however, that our efforts will prevent the risk of a security breach of our databases or systems that could adversely affect our business.\nBecause we operate our business through highly dispersed locations across the United States, our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent practices and the operating results of individual branches may vary.\nWe operate our business through a network of highly dispersed locations throughout the United States, supported by executives and services at our corporate office, with local branch management retaining responsibility for day-to-day operations and adherence to applicable local laws. Our operating structure can make it difficult for us to coordinate procedures across our operations in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our branches may require significant oversight and coordination from our corporate office to support their growth. Inconsistent implementation of corporate strategy and policies at the local level could materially and adversely affect our overall profitability, business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, the operating results of an individual branch may differ from those of another branch for a variety of reasons, including market size, management practices, competitive landscape, regulatory requirements, state and local taxes and local economic conditions. As a result, certain of our branches may experience higher or lower levels of growth than other branches. Therefore, our overall financial performance and results of operations may not be indicative of the performance and results of operations of any individual branch.\nRestrictions in our credit agreement, or any other indebtedness we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to make distributions to stockholders and the value of our common stock.\nOur credit agreement, or any future credit facility we enter into or other indebtedness we incur, may limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake distributions or dividends on or redeem or repurchase shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nincur certain liens or permit them to exist;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nacquire, merge or consolidate with another company; and\n\u2022\ntransfer, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur credit agreement contains, and any future credit facility or other debt instruments we may enter into may contain, covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios and meet certain tests, such as a fixed charge coverage ratio, leverage ratio or debt to earnings ratio. See Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Credit and Security Agreement. Our ability to comply with those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to comply with those ratios and tests when required to do so under the applicable debt instruments.\nThe provisions of our credit agreement, or other debt instruments, may affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of our credit agreement, any future credit facility or other debt instruments could result in a default or an event of default that could enable our lenders or other debt holders to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and our stockholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment.\nOur indebtedness exposes us to interest expense increases if interest rates increase.\nAs of December 31, 2017, $199.0 million of our borrowings were at variable interest rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed would remain the same, and our net income and cash flows would correspondingly decrease. An increase of 100 basis points in the interest rates payable on our variable rate indebtedness would increase our annual interest expense by $2.0 million, based on our total variable interest rate indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\nWe may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including industry and market conditions, our ability to successfully complete future business combinations and expansion of our existing operations. We anticipate that we may need to raise additional funds in order to grow our business and implement our business strategy. We anticipate that any such additional funds may be raised through equity or debt financings. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and will be subject to\nchanges in interest rates and the capital markets environment. Even if we are able to raise capital through equity or debt financings, as to which there can be no assurance, the interest of existing stockholders in our company may be diluted, and the securities we issue may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock or may otherwise materially and adversely affect the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders. If we cannot obtain adequate capital, we may not be able to fully implement our business strategy and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and your investment may decline in value.\nThe market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by factors, such as:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions affecting the residential construction, commercial construction and building products industries;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of acquisitions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the financial markets;\n\u2022\nresults of our operations and the operations of others in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation and government investigations;\n\u2022\nthe addition or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nactions taken by our stockholders, including the sale or disposition of their shares of our common stock; and\n\u2022\ndifferences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts and changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections.\nThese and other factors may lower the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nFurthermore, in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the price of our common stock and materially affect the value of your investment.\nWe are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and, as a result, we will have to comply with increased disclosure and governance requirements.\nBecause the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of June 30, 2016, we were deemed a large accelerated filer as of December 31, 2016 and, accordingly, we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. As a large accelerated filer, we are subject to certain requirements that apply to other public companies but did not previously apply to us. These requirements include:\n\u2022\ncompliance with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\ncompliance with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u2022\nfull disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nFailure to comply with these requirements could subject us to enforcement actions by the SEC, divert management\u2019s attention, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expect that compliance with the additional requirements of being a large accelerated filer will continue to require higher legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting.\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may undertake various actions, such as implementing additional internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. Testing and maintaining internal controls can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline significantly as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock or make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nWe have approximately 31.9 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2017. The shares of common stock are freely tradable, except for any shares of common stock that may be held or acquired by our directors, executive officers and other affiliates, the sale of which will be restricted under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 2.6 million of the 3.0 million shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan were available for issuance. These shares will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations. If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nTCI Holdings, LLC (\u201cTCI\u201d), an entity managed by one of our directors, has pledged 600,000 shares of our common stock to secure a loan made by a financial institution to TCI. Depending on the occurrence of certain events relating to this financial obligation, TCI may experience a foreclosure or margin call that could result in the sale of these pledged shares, in the open market or otherwise. Such sales could adversely affect the market and trading price of our common stock. Also, in the future, we may issue shares of our common stock in\nconnection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock.\nJeff Edwards has significant ownership of our common stock and may have interests that conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Jeff Edwards beneficially owns approximately 24.4% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of his beneficial ownership of our common stock, he has sufficient voting power to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions, and he has significant influence over our management and policies. This concentration of voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares of common stock, which could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of common stock. These actions may be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. The interests of Jeff Edwards may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders, and he may act in a manner that advances his best interests and not necessarily those of our other stockholders. In addition, under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Jeff Edwards is permitted to pursue corporate opportunities for himself, rather than for us.\nCapped call transactions that were entered into by parties affiliated with Jeff Edwards and that become exercisable and expire on April 16, 2018 may affect the value of our common stock.\nCertain of our stockholders entered into a capped call agreement with the underwriters of the secondary offering of our common stock completed on June 17, 2014. This agreement provided these stockholders with an option to call from the underwriters a total of approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock at a capped price, with settlement required to be made in cash. During the second quarter of 2016, these stockholders exercised the call option with respect to approximately 0.7 million of these underlying shares. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, these stockholders simultaneously cancelled the remaining portion of the call option and purchased a new call option from the underwriters. The new capped call agreement provides these stockholders with the option to call from the underwriters a total of approximately 0.4 million shares of our common stock at a capped price. The option becomes exercisable and expires on April 16, 2018 and will be settled in cash. The capped call agreement is between these stockholders and the underwriters and does not represent compensation to the stockholders for services rendered to us. The price paid for the option represents the fair value of that transaction and we are not a party to the agreement. In connection with establishing its initial hedge of the capped call transactions, the option counterparty (or one of its affiliates) purchased shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, the option counterparty (or one of its affiliates) may modify its hedge position by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions from time to time. This activity could also cause or mitigate an increase or decrease in the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict what effect the capped call transactions could have on the price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law could delay, discourage or prevent an acquisition of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and could make it more difficult for our stockholders to change our management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove members of our board of directors. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of the holders of our stock or a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\na requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by a resolution duly adopted by our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with a stockholder owning 15% or more of such corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock for a period of three years following the date on which such stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. In order for us to consummate a business combination with an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder within three years of the date on which the stockholder became \u201cinterested,\u201d either (1) the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming \u201cinterested\u201d must be approved by our board of directors prior to the date the stockholder became \u201cinterested,\u201d (2) the \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder must own at least 85% of our outstanding voting stock at the time the transaction commences (excluding voting stock owned by directors who are also officers and certain employee stock plans) or (3) the business combination must be approved by our board of directors and authorized by at least two-thirds of our stockholders (excluding the \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder). This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors and management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then-current market price for their shares of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain our future earnings, if any, in order to reinvest in the development and growth of our business and, therefore, do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, the limits imposed by the terms of our credit agreement, or any then-existing debt instruments, and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, investors in our common stock may need to sell their shares to realize a return on their investment in our common stock, and investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices paid for them.\nIf securities analysts do not publish favorable reports about us or if we, or our industry, are the subject of unfavorable commentary, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading price for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports about us that are published by analysts in the financial industry. Analysts could issue negative commentary about us or our industry, or they could downgrade our common stock. We may also not receive sufficient research coverage or visibility in the market. Any of these factors could result in the decline of the trading price of our common stock, causing investors in our common stock to lose all or a portion of their investment.", "PERMNO": 14479, "SIC": 1700, "TIC": "IBP"}
