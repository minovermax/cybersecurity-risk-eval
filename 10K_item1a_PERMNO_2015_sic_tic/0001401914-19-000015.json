RISK FACTORS\nInvestment in our securities involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. Our business, operating results, growth prospects and financial condition are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control, that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risks described below, together with all of the information in this report and our other public filings, before making investment decisions regarding our securities. Each of these risk factors, as well as additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could adversely affect our business, operating results, growth prospects or financial condition, as well as the trading price of our common stock, in which case you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations.\nWe expect that our net losses will continue for the foreseeable future as we develop our existing product candidates and seek to acquire, license or develop additional product candidates. Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, is expensive. We expect our research and development expenses to substantially increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our product candidates towards or through clinical trials. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to raise additional capital through financings, government or other grant funding, collaborations and strategic alliances or other similar types of arrangements, to successfully execute our current operating plan and to continue the development of our current product candidates.\nOur capital needs have been and will continue to depend highly on the product development programs we choose to pursue, the progress of these programs, including the number, size, timing, rate of patient recruitment, duration of patient treatment and follow-up and the results of our clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, the cost and timing of development and supply of material for our clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory submissions and decisions regarding a potential approval for any one or more of our current or future product candidates we may choose to develop, and the terms of our contracts with service providers and license partners. In addition, the development of our clinical-stage candidates, DARE-BV1, Ovaprene, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, and DARE-HRT1, and the advancement of our pre-clinical product candidates will depend on results of ongoing and upcoming clinical trials and our financial resources at the time of such results. Should our product development efforts succeed, we will need to develop a commercialization plan for each product developed, which would also require significant resources to develop and implement.\nAt December 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents were $6.8 million and our accumulated deficit was approximately $29.0 million. We expect negative cash flows from our operations to continue for the foreseeable future. We believe our existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund planned operations into the third quarter of 2019. For the foreseeable future, our ability to continue our operations will depend on our ability to obtain additional capital. We incurred a net loss of approximately $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which included a non-cash impairment charge to goodwill of approximately $5.2 million. We may never become profitable.\nFor the reasons stated above, this report includes disclosures and an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm stating that our recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements as of December 31, 2018 were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nIf we raise capital through collaborations, strategic alliances or other similar types of arrangements, we may have to relinquish, on terms that are not favorable to us, rights to some of our technologies or product candidates we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize. See also \u201c-We expect to be heavily reliant on our ability to raise capital through capital market transactions. Due to our small public float, low market capitalization, limited operating history and lack of revenue, it may be difficult and expensive for us to raise additional funds,\u201d below. There can be no assurance that we can raise capital when needed or on terms favorable to us and our stockholders. If we cannot raise capital when needed, on favorable terms or at all, we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates, will need to reevaluate our planned operations and may need to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs, reduce expenses or cease operations, any of which would have a significant negative impact on our prospects and financial condition, as well as the trading price of our common stock. See also \"Our ability to raise capital may be limited by applicable laws and regulations,\" below. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain additional funds on a timely basis, there will be an increased risk of insolvency and up to a total loss of investment by our stockholders.\nWe have a limited operating history, have incurred significant losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, which, together with our limited financial resources, makes it difficult to assess our prospects. We must raise additional capital to finance our operations and remain a going concern.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business and prospects. Drug development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves substantial risk. To date, we have not obtained any regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates, commercialized any of our product candidates or generated any product revenue. We have not been profitable since we commenced operations and may never achieve profitability. We have devoted significant resources to acquiring our portfolio of product candidates and to research and development activities for our product candidates. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. See also \"We will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations,\" above.\nOur ability to raise capital may be limited by laws and regulations.\nIn January and February 2018, we raised approximately $11.3 million in gross proceeds through the sale of equity securities under a Form S-3 \u201cshelf\u201d registration statement. Using a shelf registration statement to raise capital generally takes less time and is less expensive than other means, such as conducting an offering under a Form S-1 registration statement. We currently have a shelf registration statement effective. However, our ability to raise capital under this registration statement may be limited by, among other things, current and future SEC rules and regulations impacting the eligibility of smaller companies to use Form S-3 for primary offerings of securities. For example, the market value of our outstanding shares of common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, was less than $75.0 million at the time we filed our shelf registration statement and has been less than $75.0 million since such time. As such, we are subject to the \"baby shelf rules,\" which means that the aggregate market value of securities sold by us or on our behalf pursuant to Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3 during the 12 calendar months immediately prior to, and including the intended sale is limited to no more than one-third of the aggregate market value of our public float. Our public float for this purpose is calculated by multiplying (a) the number of shares of common stock in our public float by (b) the highest price at which the common stock was last sold as of a date within 60 days prior to the date of the intended sale. The highest price at which our common stock last sold as of a date within 60 days of March 29, 2019 was $2.10, and based on that price, our public float would be approximately $19.2 million, one-third of which is $6.4 million. No securities have been sold by us or on our behalf pursuant to Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3 during the 12 calendar months ending March 29, 2019. If our ability to offer securities under our shelf registration statement is limited, we may choose to conduct such an offering under an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 or under a Form S-1 registration statement. We would expect either alternative to increase the cost of raising additional capital relative to using our shelf registration statement.\nIn addition, under SEC rules and regulations, our common stock must be listed and registered on a national securities exchange in order to use a Form S-3 registration statement (1) for a primary offering, if our public float is not at least $75.0 million as of a date within 60 days prior to the date of filing the Form S-3 or a re-evaluation date, whichever is later, and (2) to register the resale of our securities by persons other than us (i.e., a resale offering). While our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that we can maintain such listing. See, \u201c-Risks Related to Our Securities-There is no assurance that we will continue satisfying the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market,\u201d below.\nOur ability to timely raise sufficient additional capital also may be limited by Nasdaq\u2019s stockholder approval requirements for transactions involving the issuance of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in an offering other than a public offering (as defined in Nasdaq listing rules). For instance, generally, stockholder approval is required prior to the issuance or potential issuance of common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) which (together with sales by our officers, directors and substantial shareholders (as defined in Nasdaq listing rules)) equals 20% or more of our common stock outstanding before the issuance at a price that is less than the lower of the closing price of our common stock or the five trading day average closing price of our common stock, in each case, immediately preceding the signing of the binding agreement (the \u201cMinimum Price\u201d). A public offering under Nasdaq rules typically involves broadly announcing the proposed transaction, which often has the effect of depressing the company\u2019s stock price. Accordingly, the price at which we could sell our securities in a public offering may be less, and the dilution existing stockholders experience may in turn be greater, than if we raised capital through other means. In addition, certain prior sales of our securities by us may be aggregated with an offering we may propose, further limiting the amount we could raise in any future offering that is not considered a public offering by Nasdaq and involves the sale, issuance or potential issuance by us of our common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) at a price that is less than the Minimum Price. Under Nasdaq listing rules, stockholder approval is also required prior to the issuance of securities when the issuance or potential issuance will result in a change of control of our company.\nObtaining stockholder approval is a costly and time-consuming process. If we must obtain stockholder approval for a potential transaction, we would expect to spend substantial additional money and resources. In addition,\nseeking stockholder approval would delay our receipt of otherwise available capital, which may materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan, and there is no guarantee our stockholders ultimately would approve a proposed transaction.\nDue in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates, and we may be unable to pursue and complete the clinical trials we would like to pursue and complete.\nOur current financial and technical resources are limited and not sufficient to develop all of the product candidates to which we hold licenses or options to license. This may affect the development efforts of our key portfolio candidates and any future candidates we may choose to develop. Due to our limited resources, we may be required to curtail clinical development programs and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates, or product candidates that we may in the future choose to develop, through the regulatory and development processes. We may make incorrect determinations with regard to the indications and clinical trials on which to focus our resources. The decisions to allocate our research, management and financial resources toward particular indications may not lead to positive clinical milestones or to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities, including the potential for some of our product candidates to be first-in-category products.\nWe are heavily reliant on our ability to raise capital through capital market transactions. Due to our low public float, low market capitalization, limited operating history and lack of revenue, it may be difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital.\nWe are heavily reliant on our ability to raise additional capital by selling shares of our common stock or securities linked to our common stock. Our ability to raise capital will depend on several factors, many of which may not be favorable for raising capital, including the low trading volume and volatile trading price of our common stock, our low public float, our potential inability to continue to satisfy the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, unfavorable market conditions or other market factors outside of our control, and the risk factors described elsewhere in this report, including those related to warrants we issued in February 2018. See \u201c-Our ability to raise capital may be limited by laws and regulations,\u201d above, and the risk factors under \u201c-Risks Related to Our Securities,\u201d below. Even if we are able to raise additional capital, it will likely be dilutive to existing stockholders and the cost of such capital may be substantial and may be more expensive than the cost of capital for larger public companies. The terms of any funding we obtain may not be favorable to us and may be highly dilutive to our stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. There can be no assurance that we can raise additional capital when needed. Failing to raise additional capital when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have been actively adding product candidates to our portfolio of innovative products for women\u2019s health, but we currently are not adequately capitalized to advance these product candidates through development.\nOur business strategy is to license or otherwise acquire the rights to differentiated health product candidates primarily in the areas of contraception, vaginal health, sexual health, and fertility, and to take those candidates through advanced stages of clinical development and regulatory approval. Advancing product candidates through late stages of clinical development will require substantial investment. We currently do not have the capital necessary to advance the product candidates to which we hold licenses and options to license. Executing our business strategy requires us to obtain additional capital to license or otherwise acquire rights to additional product candidates to grow and advance our portfolio and to take our current and future product candidates through clinical development and eventually to commercialization or strategic partnership. Such capital may not be available to us, or even it is, the cost of such capital may be high. See \u201c-We will need to raise additional capital to continue our operations,\u201d above. Should we add additional product candidates to our portfolio, should our existing product candidates require testing or other capital -intensive procedures we did not anticipate, or should the duration of our ongoing clinical trials be longer than anticipated due to difficulties in patient recruitment or otherwise, our cash resources will be further strained. We may be forced to obtain additional capital before reaching clinical milestones, when our stock price or trading volume or both are low, or when the general market for biopharmaceutical, medical device, or other life sciences companies is weak. Raising capital under any of these or similar scenarios, if we can raise any at all, may lead to significant dilution to our existing stockholders. If we cannot raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we will not be able to advance our product candidates or add additional product candidates to our portfolio, we may relinquish rights under our license agreements with third parties relating to our product candidates, and we will have to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations. See also \u201c-We depend highly on our license agreements for our clinical stage product candidates and the loss or impairment of our rights under any license would have a materially adverse effect on our business prospects, operations and viability\u201d below.\nWe intend to seek collaborations with partners to develop and commercialize our product candidates and, if we enter into such collaborations, we may not have control over several key elements relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nA key aspect of our strategy is to seek collaborations with partners, such as large pharmaceutical companies, that are willing to conduct later-stage clinical trials and further develop and commercialize our product candidates. To date, we have not entered into any such collaborations, and we may not be able to enter into any collaborations on acceptable terms, if at all. We face significant competition in seeking these types of partners. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming arrangements to negotiate and document.\nBy entering into a strategic collaboration with a partner, we may rely on the partner for financial resources and for development, regulatory and commercialization expertise. Even if we are successful in entering into a strategic collaboration for one of our product candidates, our partner may fail to develop or effectively commercialize the product candidate because such partner:\n\u2022\ndoes not have sufficient resources or decides not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints such as limited cash or human resources;\n\u2022\ndecides to pursue a competitive potential product developed outside of the collaboration;\n\u2022\ncannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nchanges its business strategy and areas of focus;\n\u2022\ndetermines that the market opportunity is not attractive;\n\u2022\ncannot obtain sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates at a reasonable cost; or\n\u2022\nelects to terminate our strategic collaboration for any reason.\nOur success in entering into a definitive agreement for any collaboration will depend upon, among other things, our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of several factors. Those factors may include the design and outcomes of the clinical studies, the likelihood of approval by regulatory authorities, the potential market for the product, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such products to customers, the potential of competing products, the strength of the intellectual property and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative products or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our products or product candidates.\nWe also face competition in our search for collaborators from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies worldwide, many of which are larger and able to offer more attractive deals in terms of financial commitments, contribution of human resources, or development, manufacturing, regulatory or commercial expertise and support.\nAny potential collaboration agreement into which we might enter may call for licensing or cross-licensing of potentially blocking patents, know-how or other intellectual property. Due to the potential overlap of data, know-how and intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that a collaborator will not dispute its right to use, license or distribute such data, know-how or other intellectual property rights, and this may lead to disputes, liability or termination of the collaboration.\nIf we elect to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we will need to obtain significant additional capital, which may not be available to us when needed on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf we are not successful in attracting collaborators and entering into collaborations on acceptable terms for our product candidates or otherwise monetizing our product candidates, we may not complete development of or obtain regulatory approval for such product candidates. In such event, our ability to generate revenues from such products and achieve or sustain profitability would be significantly hindered which would materially harm our business and financial condition.\nThe women\u2019s health care product candidates we are developing or may develop are likely to face significant competition. If we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, their ability to compete will be impacted by the efficacy and safety outcomes of our clinical trials.\nToday, there are a variety of hormonal and non-hormonal contraceptive options available to women, including oral contraceptive pills and intrauterine devices, newer hormonal contraceptive products including implants, injectables, vaginal rings, patches, and hormonal intrauterine systems, and non-hormonal methods such as female condoms, novel diaphragms, and new methods of female sterilization. In surveys, women have said that the features they consider most important when selecting a contraceptive method are efficacy, ease-of-use and side effects. To have significant revenue potential as a new contraceptive product option, we seek for Ovaprene to have a typical use efficacy outcome (which is the expected rate of pregnancy protection once the product is used widely under every day\ncircumstances) consistent with the diaphragm, which is approximately 88% effective. Clinical testing will also need to demonstrate that the device can be safely worn for multiple weeks. Should Ovaprene fail to generate the safety and efficacy data expected, our business prospects would be materially damaged.\nToday\u2019s available options for treating FSAD consist primarily of over-the-counter products for vaginal lubrication. Although no products have been approved by the FDA specifically for the treatment of FSAD, we believe new product candidates will likely be developed by others. Sexual arousal can be influenced by many emotional and physiological factors and hence, our clinical trials must anticipate such factors in order to produce efficacious outcomes. Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, is designed to increase local blood flow to the genital tissue. Even if we are successful in increasing blood flow, the product may not lead to an increase in arousal or an improvement in the overall sexual experience in some women. If we fail to generate compelling clinical results from our trials, many women suffering from sexual arousal disorder may opt not to try Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%. If we fail to produce strong clinical outcomes, our ability to build a commercial market for Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% will be materially adversely impacted.\nThere are several FDA-approved products in oral and vaginal forms currently available for treating bacterial vaginosis, or BV, and, if approved, DARE-BV1 will compete with those products. Current therapies for the treatment of BV primarily consist of oral and vaginal formulations of antibiotics delivered as a single dose or through multiple doses over consecutive days. Two of the most common antibiotics used today are generic clindamycin and metronidazole. In clinical studies, DARE-BV1 will need to demonstrate that it is both safe and effective in order to complete with existing and future products approved for the treatment of BV. In particular, DARE-BV1 will likely be compared with Clindesse\u00ae (clindamycin phosphate) Vaginal Cream, 2% as this treatment is a vaginally administered, single dose cream formulation of clindamycin. If we fail to generate compelling clinical outcomes, including clinical cure rates and continued clinical response rates following a single dose of DARE-BV1 that are better than existing products, physicians may opt to continue to prescribe currently available treatments rather than recommend or prescribe our product to their patients. In addition, women may prefer orally delivered options to our vaginally delivered product unless our product demonstrates significantly superior efficacy and/or safety.\nSee also \u201c-The patents and the patent applications covering Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% and DARE-BV1 are limited to specific topical formulations, processes and uses of sildenafil and clindamycin, and our market opportunity may be limited by the lack of patent protection for the active ingredient itself and other formulations and delivery technology and systems that may be developed by competitors,\u201d below.\nTreatments to address the vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, including hot flashes, include combinations of prescription hormones, some of which are FDA-approved and others which are prepared in compounding pharmacies. Numerous products already exist, and this number is likely to expand with time. In addition, there has been an emerging preference among some women and providers for bio-identical hormones that are chemically identical to those the body produces. DARE-HRT1 will be designed to offer a convenient vaginal ring that continuously delivers a combination of bio-identical estradiol and progesterone over 28 days. Until recently, no FDA-approved bio-identical hormone treatments existed. In 2018, Bijuva\u00ae estradiol and progesterone capsules, which are to be taken daily, received the first such approval. Studies have failed to demonstrate that bio-identical hormones are safer than other hormones, so DARE-BV1 will need to compete with many types of hormone replacement options in terms of convenience, safety and efficacy in managing vasomotor symptoms.\nToday, a variety of options are available for the delivery of hormones to assist in the maintenance of pregnancy or to treat the symptoms of menopause. If approved, our intravaginal ring, or IVR, candidates will compete with pills, patches and other hormonal delivery methods, and competing with those products may prove difficult given the current marketplace and established clinical practices. We believe our clinical trials for these candidates must demonstrate efficacy comparable to or better than existing products and also prove that the candidates would be more convenient. Some women may be uncomfortable with using an IVR and may never try our IVR products. If we fail to generate compelling clinical results from clinical trials, we may lack the data to generate a commercially viable product, which would harm our business.\nToday\u2019s treatments for vulvar and vaginal atrophy, or VVA, primarily consist of hormones, including localized estrogen. However, this therapeutic approach is often contraindicated for women diagnosed with, or at risk of recurrence of, hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends a local non-hormonal approach for treating chronic conditions like VVA in these women. Although many women may be contraindicated for hormone use, particularly with respect to estrogen use, and there are no FDA-approved VVA treatments that have been specifically studied in these hormone receptor positive women, and therefore many doctors continue to prescribe, and many women continue to use, hormone-based treatments. If approved, our tamoxifen candidate for the treatment of VVA will compete with branded pills, vaginal inserts and other delivery methods for hormones. We believe our clinical trials must demonstrate comparable efficacy and safety with existing products currently used in VVA, including those that have not been studied in, but are nonetheless used in, breast cancer survivors. If we\nfail to generate compelling clinical results or if patients and physicians fail to appreciate the value of a therapy that is not based on estrogen, we may not have a commercially viable product, which would harm our business.\nWe have a relatively small number of employees to manage and operate our business.\nAs of March 29, 2019, we had 14 employees; nine full-time and five part-time. Our focus on limiting cash utilization requires us to manage and operate our business in a highly efficient manner, relying on external consultants for needed clinical development expertise and to limit full-time personnel resources. No assurance can be given that we will be able to run our operations or accomplish all of the objectives we otherwise would seek to accomplish with the limited personnel resources we currently have.\nIf we fail to attract and retain management and other key personnel, we may not successfully commercialize our product candidates, develop any product candidates or otherwise implement our business plan.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial and key personnel. We depend highly on our senior management. Losing the services of any of our senior management employees could impede, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates, hurt our ability to raise additional funds and negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan. If we lose the services of any of our senior management employees, we might not find suitable replacements on a timely basis or at all, and our business could be materially harmed. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of any of our senior management employees.\nWe might not attract or retain qualified management and other key personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, medical device, pharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in the San Diego area where we are headquartered. As a result, we may have to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts. Many of the other companies within the contraceptive industry with whom we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and longer histories in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. If we cannot attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will harm our ability to implement our business strategy and achieve our business objectives.\nOur business development strategy has included, and will likely continue to include, acquiring products, product licenses or other businesses. We may not successfully manage such activities.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions that could cause us to incur additional liabilities, commitments or significant expense. During the year ending December 31, 2018, we entered into license agreements with each of SST and Juniper and a collaboration and option agreement with Orbis Biosciences Inc.; completed the acquisition of Pear Tree Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the acquisition of assets from Hydra Biosciences, Inc.; and entered into assignment and license agreements with Hammock Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Trilogic Pharma, LLC and MilanaPharm LLC. All of these transactions could subject us to several risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour inability to appropriately evaluate the potential risks and uncertainties associated with a transaction;\n\u2022\nour inability to effectively integrate a new technology, product and/or business, personnel, intellectual property or business relationships; and\n\u2022\nour inability to generate milestones or revenues from a strategic transaction sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the transaction.\nWe may underestimate development costs, timelines, regulatory approval challenges and commercial market opportunity for a strategic transaction that would cause us to fail to realize the anticipated value of the transaction. Any strategic transaction we may pursue may not produce the outcomes and benefits we originally anticipated, may result in costs that outweigh the benefits, and may adversely impact our financial condition and be detrimental to our company in general.\nOur current or future employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards.\nWe may become exposed to the risk of employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, suppliers, commercial partners or vendors engaging in fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, suppliers, commercial partners and vendors could include intentional failures such as failures to: (1) comply with FDA or other regulators\u2019 requirements, (2) provide accurate information to such regulators, (3) comply with manufacturing standards established by us and/or required by law, or (4)\ncomply with SEC rules and regulations. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws, regulations and industry guidance intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by current or future employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, suppliers, commercial partners and vendors could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory or civil sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, suppliers, commercial partners and vendors, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant adverse effect on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions, and our reputation.\nWe expect to continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will have to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nWe incur and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a public reporting company. We expect that these expenses will increase after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We expect that we will need to hire additional accounting, finance and other personnel in connection with our continuing efforts to comply with the requirements of being a public company, and our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote substantial time towards maintaining compliance with these requirements. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel, of whom we have a small number, will need to devote substantial time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costlier.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, we will have to furnish a report by our management on our internal controls over financial reporting, including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To comply with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue implementing steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nWe utilize information technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store electronic information in connection with our business activities. As the use of digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks, have increased in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data, all of which are vital to our operations and business strategy. There can be no assurance we will succeed in preventing cyber-attacks or successfully mitigating their effects.\nDespite implementing security measures, any of the internal computer systems belonging to us or our third-party service providers are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failure. Any system failure, accident, security breach or data breach that causes interruptions in our own or in third-party service vendors\u2019 operations could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, losing clinical study data from future clinical studies could result in delays in our or our partners\u2019 regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs in order to recover or reproduce the lost data. Further, our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including firewalls, servers, leased lines and connection to the Internet, face the risk of systemic failure, which could disrupt our operations. If any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we may incur resulting liability, our product development programs and competitive\nposition may be adversely affected, and the further development of our products may be delayed. Furthermore, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development, Manufacturing and Commercialization\nOur success will depend heavily on our ability to develop DARE-BV1, Ovaprene, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% and DARE-HRT1. Failure to develop these product candidates would likely adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends on the successful clinical development and regulatory approval of our four clinical trial stage product candidates, which may never occur. All of our product candidates will require substantial clinical testing to demonstrate that they are safe and effective. For example, we will need to demonstrate that DARE-BV1 is a safe and effective vaginal gel option for women with BV, that Ovaprene is a safe and effective non-hormonal contraceptive option, that Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% is a safe and effective option for women seeking treatment of FSAD and that DARE-HRT1 is a convenient to use IVR that provides safe and effective relief from vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. We have never received a regulatory approval for any product. Even if we can conduct and complete clinical trials for these product candidates, we may not obtain regulatory approval for any of them, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe depend highly on our license agreements for our clinical stage product candidates and the loss or impairment of our rights under any license would have a materially adverse effect on our business prospects, operations and viability.\nOur current portfolio includes four clinical stage product candidates, all of which we have licensed from other parties and all of which are critical to our business.\nIn July 2017, we entered into a license agreement with ADVA-Tec for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Ovaprene. In addition to standard termination rights, ADVA-Tec may terminate the license agreement if we (1) fail to make significant scheduled investments in product development activities over the course of the agreement, (2) fail to commercialize Ovaprene within 6 months of obtaining a PMA from the FDA, (3) with respect to the license in any particular country, fail to commercialize Ovaprene in that particular country within 3 years of the first commercial sale, (4) develop or commercialize a non-hormonal ring-based vaginal contraceptive device other than Ovaprene or (5) fail to conduct certain clinical trials. See \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS-Overview-License Agreements-ADVA-Tec License Agreement,\u201d above.\nIn February 2018, we entered into a world-wide license and collaboration agreement with SST for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% for all indications for women related to female sexual dysfunction and/or female reproductive health, including treatment of the female sexual arousal disorder FSAD. The SST license agreement provides that each party will have customary rights to terminate the agreement in the event of material uncured breach by the other party and under certain other circumstances. The SST license agreement provides SST with the right to terminate it with respect to the applicable SST licensed products in specified countries upon 30 days\u2019 notice if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform development activities in substantial accordance with the development plan contained in the SST license agreement and do not cure such failure within 60 days of receipt of SST\u2019s notice thereof. See \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS-Overview-License Agreements-SST License and Collaboration Agreement,\u201d above.\nIn April 2018, we entered into the Juniper License Agreement under which we acquired exclusive global rights to Juniper\u2019s IVR technology platform, including the product candidates we now call DARE-HRT1, DARE-FRT1 and DARE-OAB1. Under the Juniper License Agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and make at least one product or process available to the public, which efforts include achieving specific diligence requirements by specific dates specified in the Juniper License Agreement, and Juniper may terminate the agreement upon 60 days\u2019 notice for any uncured material breach by us of any of our other obligations under the agreement. See \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS-Overview-License Agreements-Juniper Pharmaceuticals License Agreement,\u201d above.\nIn December 2018, we entered into definitive agreements with Hammock Pharmaceuticals, Inc., TriLogic Pharma LLC and MilanaPharm LLC under which we acquired exclusive global rights to DARE-BV1 for the treatment of BV, as well as the rights to utilize the underlying proprietary hydrogel drug delivery technology for any vaginal or urological application in humans. Under the license agreement with TriLogic Pharma and MilanaPharm, we must use commercially reasonable efforts and resources consistent with those we undertake in pursuing development and commercialization of other pharmaceutical products, taking into account program-specific factors, (a) to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product or process in the United States and at least one licensed product or process in at least one of Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy or Spain, and (b) following the first commercial sale of a licensed product or process in any jurisdiction, to continue to commercialize that product or process in that jurisdiction. MilanaPharm may terminate our license if, after having launched such product or process in such country, we, or our affiliates or\nsublicensees, as applicable, discontinue the sale of, or commercially reasonable marketing efforts to sell, such product or process in such country, and fail to resume such efforts or to reasonably demonstrate a strategic justification for the discontinuation and failure. See \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS-Overview-License Agreements-Hammock/MilanaPharm Assignment and License Agreement,\u201d above.\nIf any of our license agreements with ADVA-Tec, SST, Juniper Pharmaceuticals, or Hammock Pharmaceuticals/MilanaPharm are terminated, impaired, or limited, we could lose the ability to develop and commercialize Ovaprene, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, DARE-BV1, or any of our IVR product candidates, including DARE-HRT1, as applicable, any of which would have a materially adverse effect on our business prospects and operations.\nWe may seek to license the product and technology rights to additional product candidates in women\u2019s health, but there can be no assurance we will be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. There are risks, uncertainties and costs associated with identifying, licensing and advancing product candidates through successful clinical development. Even if we obtained the rights to additional product candidates, there can be no assurance these candidates will ever be advanced successfully through clinical development.\nDelays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing of our current and any other future product candidates we may seek to develop could result in increased costs and longer timelines and could impact our ability to ever become profitable. Clinical testing is time consuming and expensive and its outcome is uncertain.\nIn May 2018, we commenced a PCT clinical trial to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of Ovaprene, which trial is ongoing. During the second half of 2019, we intend to commence the at-home portion of the Phase 2b clinical program for Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% for FSAD and a Phase 3 clinical trial of DARE-BV1 for BV, and to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial for DARE-HRT1. The timing of when we initiate these clinical studies will be influenced by ongoing and planned discussions with the FDA and, with respect to the Phase 2b program for Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, the outcome of our content validity study assessing the patient reported outcome instrument proposed to be used in the Phase 2b clinical trial. DARE-HRT1 has been tested only in pre-clinical studies, and we will need to obtain authorizations from the FDA and institutional review boards of universities and clinics, as appropriate, to commence clinical testing of this candidate in humans in the United States. The initiation, conduct and completion of these and other clinical trials for our product candidates may vary dramatically due to factors within and outside of our control, and the results from early clinical trials may not necessarily be predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials. Even if results from early clinical trials are positive, we may not be able to confirm those results in future clinical trials. Further, clinical trials may never demonstrate sufficient safety and effectiveness to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our product candidates. Any change in, or termination of, clinical trials could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe tests and clinical trials of our current and any future product candidates we may seek to develop may not commence, progress or be completed as expected, and delays would significantly impact our product development costs and timelines. The commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for many reasons, including delays in:\n\u25e6\nobtaining required funding;\n\u25e6\nexpected rates of recruitment and enrollment;\n\u25e6\nobtaining guidance or authorizations from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u25e6\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u25e6\nobtaining sufficient quantities of clinical trial materials for product candidates;\n\u25e6\nobtaining IRB approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site; and\n\u25e6\nrecruiting participants in a timely manner.\nIn addition, once a clinical trial has begun, it may experience unanticipated delays or be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to several factors, all of which could impact our ability to complete our trials in a timely and cost-efficient manner, including:\n\u25e6\nfailure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25e6\nslower than expected rates of participant recruitment and enrollment;\n\u25e6\nhigher than anticipated participant drop-out rates;\n\u25e6\nfailure of clinical trial participants to use the product as directed or to report data as per trial protocols;\n\u25e6\ninspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u25e6\nfailure to achieve certain efficacy and/or safety standards;\n\u25e6\nparticipants experiencing severe side effects or other adverse events related to the investigational treatment; or\n\u25e6\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nDARE-BV1 is a new vaginal formulation of clindamycin being developed for a bacterial infection known for being difficult to treat and cure. Encouraging results from a proof-of-concept study may fail to be replicated.\nDARE-BV1 is a novel hydrogel formulation of clindamycin, a popular antibiotic currently available in other formulations for treating BV. BV effects over 20 million women and is known for being a difficult vaginal infection to cure. Our belief is that allowing the drug to remain in place for multiple days and requiring no intervention by the patient beyond the initial application will improve outcomes. However, other pharmaceutical companies have employed a similar approach, with clindamycin and other antibiotics, and have generated only marginally improved outcomes. To date DARE-BV1 has been studied in only 30 women in an investigator-sponsored study. We cannot predict whether our formulation will produce a successful therapeutic outcome and meet the endpoints required for regulatory approval. Even if DARE-BV1 receives approval, it will face significant competition from existing and potentially new therapies. Failure to generate compelling outcome data will hurt our ability to partner the asset and significantly decrease the asset\u2019s value.\nOvaprene is a drug/device combination and the process for obtaining regulatory approval in the United States will require compliance with more complex requirements of the FDA applicable to combination products. A change in the FDA\u2019s primary oversight responsibility would adversely impact our development timeline and significantly raise our costs.\nOvaprene is composed of both device and drug components and is considered a combination product by the FDA. It is a contraceptive intravaginal ring that releases locally acting spermiostatic agents and has a permeable mesh in its center designed to create a partial barrier to sperm. The barrier seeks to block the progression of sperm into the cervical mucus while the agents seek to create an environment inhospitable to sperm. Ovaprene previously underwent a request for designation, or RFD, process with the FDA that determined that the product had a device-primary mode of action and CDRH would lead the review of a PMA for the product. If the designation were to be changed to drug-primary mode of action and assigned to CDER, or if either division were to institute additional requirements for the approval of Ovaprene, we could be required to complete clinical studies with more patients and over longer periods of time than is currently anticipated. This would require us to raise additional funds and would cause us to miss anticipated timelines. Because Ovaprene is one of our lead product candidates currently in development, the impact of either a change in the lead FDA review center or the imposition of additional requirements for approval would be significant to us and would have a material adverse effect on the prospects for developing Ovaprene, our business and our financial condition.\nThe factors contributing to Female Sexual Dysfunction, including genital arousal disorders, are complex making the design and implementation of a successful clinical trial of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% challenging.\nFemale Sexual Dysfunction disorders in women vary in nature and may be the result of a variety of physiological and psychological factors. Given the variability of factors contributing to the underlying condition, clinical studies to evaluate effectiveness in any subset of the condition under the umbrella of Sexual Dysfunction, such as female sexual arousal disorder, or FSAD, are complex. Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% is designed to work primarily by increasing blood flow to the genital tissue. Therefore, it will be critical for us to identify and enroll patients in our clinical trials of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% for whom inadequate blood flow to the genital tissue is the primary contributor to their arousal disorder. If we fail to screen properly, and instead enroll patients with different contributing factors, the results of our clinical trials are unlikely to demonstrate effectiveness of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%. Even if we can identify women for whom inadequate blood flow to the genital tissue is the primary contributing factor to their sexual arousal difficulties, there is no guaranty that the use of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% will improve their general feelings of arousal or that we can utilize a patient reported outcome measure that adequately captures their genital arousal response. Given the factors contributing to arousal disorders, we may be forced to run clinical trials in large patient populations, extending the timelines and increasing the cost of product development.\nToday, there are no FDA-approved treatments for FSAD, and we lack a precedent program to assist in the design of our clinical trials. These factors increase our development risk and the chance of failure. Our failure to design and implement a successful clinical trial for Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% would have materially adverse effect on our business and our financial condition.\nDARE-HRT1 utilizes a vaginal ring technology never tested in women; even if it successfully advances through clinical testing, it will likely face significant commercial competition.\nDARE-HRT1 represents the earliest of our clinical-stage assets and the upcoming Phase 1 study in Australia represents the first human testing of this novel intravaginal ring technology. To date, all studies have been\ninvitro studies or animal studies. The risks associated with earlier stage technologies tend to be higher and the rate of failure tends to be greater. While the IVR technology has generated promising results in pre-clinical studies, there can be no assurance these results will be replicated when tested in human subjects. Even if successful, many approved therapies exist for treating the vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, including hot flashes. There is no guaranty that women will prefer the convenience of a monthly vaginal ring over pills, patches and creams. Failure of DARE-HRT1 could have a meaningful effect on the likelihood of the IVR technology being applied to another indication. These developments would materially impact the value of this technology platform to our stockholders.\nOur business depends on obtaining FDA approval for our product candidates in a timely manner, and the requirements for obtaining approval may change over time, requiring more financial resources and development time than we currently anticipate.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain FDA regulatory approvals for our product candidates in a timely and cost-efficient manner. We may experience delays in our efforts to obtain such approvals for any of our product candidates, and there can be no assurance that such approvals will not be delayed, or that the FDA will ultimately approve these product candidates. The development path of our product candidates will reflect current FDA requirements, additional future FDA requirements, and may be influenced by the outcomes of other similar product candidates under development. In addition, the announcement of new requirements by the FDA, the failure of a competitive product to receive regulatory approval, or the receipt of a CRL from the FDA by another company pursuing the FDA's 505(b)(2) pathway that may have implications for our proposed pathway could impact how investors and potential strategic parties view the development risks associated with our product candidates. Changing clinical requirements for us or for others deemed to be comparable to us may adversely impact our financial resources, our development timelines and may harm the perception held by others of our business.\nSuccessful challenges to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) could impact the clinical development of DARE-BV1, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, DARE-HRT1, DARE-VVA1, other IVR product candidates and future candidates we may license or acquire and materially harm our business.\nWe intend to develop and seek approval for DARE-BV1, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, our IVR product candidates, including DARE-HRT1, DARE-VVA1 and other candidates we may license or acquire, including ORB-204 and ORB-214, pursuant to the FDA\u2019s 505(b)(2) pathway. If the FDA determines that we may not use that pathway for the development of any of these candidates, then we would have to seek regulatory approval via a \u201cfull\u201d or \u201cstand-alone\u201d NDA under Section 505(b)(1). This would require us to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information, and meet additional standards for regulatory approval including possibly pre-clinical data. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for these candidates, and the complications and risks associated with the respective product candidate or candidates, would likely substantially increase and would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to the FDCA. As described above, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies and information that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2), if applicable to us under the FDCA, would allow an NDA we submit to the FDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA\u2019s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of approved compounds, which could expedite the development programs for DARE-BV1, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, our IVR product candidates, including DARE-HRT1, DARE-VVA1, ORB-204 and ORB-214.\nAlthough the FDA\u2019s longstanding position has been that it may rely upon prior findings of safety or effectiveness to support approval of a 505(b)(2) application, this policy has been controversial and subject to challenge. In addition, notwithstanding the approval of an increasing number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may change its 505(b)(2) policies and practices, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA we submit under Section 505(b)(2). In addition, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to special requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for one or more of our candidates, there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to faster product development or earlier approval.\nMoreover, any delay resulting from our inability to pursue the FDA's 505(b)(2) pathway could result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than our product candidates, which would likely materially adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the FDA's 505(b)(2) pathway, we cannot assure you that our product candidates will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization.\nObtaining regulatory approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process and may not be obtained on a timely basis, or at all. The requirements for approval may change over time and our clinical development programs may not accurately anticipate all of our regulatory requirements.\nEven if we receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, they may not gain acceptance among physicians, consumers or the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenue, which will undermine our growth prospects.\nEven if our product candidates are approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the degree of market acceptance of any new product by physicians, consumers, health care professionals and third-party payors will depend on several factors, including:\n\u2022\ndemonstrated evidence of efficacy and safety;\n\u2022\nsufficient third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement;\n\u2022\neffectiveness of our or our collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategy;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of uninsured consumers to pay for the product;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of pharmacy chains to stock the products;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects; and\n\u2022\navailability of alternative products.\nIf our products fail to provide a benefit over then currently available options, we are unlikely to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability.\nThe commercial success of DARE-BV1 will depend on the availability of alternative products for BV and women\u2019s preferences, in addition to the market\u2019s acceptance of our vaginal gel therapy.\nToday, there are many approved products for BV, and most are generic. Should DARE-BV1 receive marketing approval, its commercial success will depend on many factors:\n\u2022\nstrength of the efficacy data supporting the cure and clinical cure rates;\n\u2022\npatient satisfaction and willingness to use it again and refer it to others;\n\u2022\ncommercial launch efforts of Lupin for Solosec\u00ae, a recently approved single-dose oral therapy;\n\u2022\npreference by women for a vaginally administered therapy;\n\u2022\nprice pressure given today\u2019s high level of generic treatments; and\n\u2022\napproval of new entrants, including alternative, non-antibiotic treatment options.\nAny of these factors could reduce the commercial potential for DARE-BV1 and place pressure on our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects.\nThe commercial success of Ovaprene will depend on the availability of alternative contraceptive products and women's preferences, in addition to the market's acceptance of our non-hormonal vaginal ring.\nIf we receive regulatory approval to market Ovaprene, its commercial success, or the success of any other future contraceptive product candidate we may seek to develop, including our current pre-clinical candidates, will depend upon the contraceptive market and market acceptance of an alternative method. Risks related to market acceptance include:\n\u2022\nminimum acceptable contraceptive efficacy rates;\n\u2022\nperceived safety differences of hormonal and/or non-hormonal contraceptive options;\n\u2022\nchanges in health care laws and regulations, including the ACA, and its effect on pharmaceutical coverage, reimbursement and pricing, and the birth control mandate;\n\u2022\ncompetition from new lower dose hormonal contraceptives with more favorable side effect profiles; and\n\u2022\nnew generic contraceptive options including a generic version of the hormone-containing intravaginal product NuvaRing\u00ae.\nIf one or more of these risks occur, it could reduce the market potential for Ovaprene, or any future contraceptive product we may seek to develop, and place pressure on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe commercial success of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% will depend on the availability of alternative products for Female Sexual Disorders and women's preferences, in addition to the market's acceptance of our topical cream.\nToday, there are no FDA-approved products to treat FSAD. While our goal is for Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% to be the first product to receive such approval, other competitive products may obtain an approval before us. Even if we achieve that goal, the costs associated with introducing a new product into the women\u2019s health market would likely be significant, and regardless of the amount spent, there is no guarantee that our new product will be broadly adopted. Our commercial success with Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% will depend, in large part, on our ability to educate doctors and women about the need to diagnose and treat FSAD and to demonstrate the merits of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%;\nWomen may be hesitant to use Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% for many reasons, including the lack of experience with any product designed to treat FSAD, the lack or perceived lack of clinical evidence supporting its benefits, and the out-of-pocket cost of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, particularly if it is not covered by insurance.\nThe commercial success of DARE-HRT1 will depend on the availability of alternative products for managing the vasomotor symptoms of menopause and women's preferences, in addition to the market's acceptance of our IVR.\nRisks related to market acceptance of DARE-HRT1, if approved for hormone replacement therapy, include:\n\u2022\npreference for a vaginal ring delivery of hormone replacement therapy over pills, patches and creams by menopausal women;\n\u2022\ndata regarding symptom relief of DARE-HRT1 over other hormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause;\n\u2022\npreference for bio-identical hormones by women and health care providers; positive or negative news and research regarding bio-identicals;\n\u2022\ncommercial launch efforts of TherapeuticsMD for Bijuva\u00ae, the first FDA-approved bio-identical product;\n\u2022\nnew information supportive or against the use of hormones in menopause; and\n\u2022\navailability of insurance reimbursement for DARE-HRT1.\nDepending upon the direction of the factors above, a commercial market for DARE-HRT1 may develop more slowly than expected, or not at all, and our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects would be hurt.\nIf we suffer negative publicity concerning the safety or efficacy of our products in development, our reputation could be harmed, and we may be forced to cease development of such products.\nIf concerns should arise about the actual or anticipated clinical outcomes regarding the safety of any of our product candidates, such concerns could adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of these candidates, which could lead to a decline in investors\u2019 expectations and a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur clinical product candidates have only been tested in a small number of women over short periods of use and no data exists regarding a potential increase in fetal abnormalities in pregnant women.\nIf DARE-BV1, Ovaprene, or Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% are successful in their clinical development, we expect that women of child-bearing age will use them, and potentially for many months or years. To date, human clinical studies of these product candidates have been for relatively short periods of time and these product candidates lack safety data over longer periods of use. For example, while we believe the risk of adverse fetal development from using these product candidates is low, the impact of Ovaprene on fetal development has not been studied and there are no adequate or well-controlled studies of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% in pregnant women. Thus, the risk of adverse fetal development from any one or more of these product candidates may be greater than expected. Should any of these product candidates be shown to increase the risk of adverse fetal development, our ability to develop those or other product candidates would be substantially impaired, our business prospects and operations would be materially harmed, and we could also be subject to potential claims and lawsuits.\nOur Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% product candidate may pose a greater risk to older or elderly women.\nFSAD is a condition that impacts women of many ages, including older and elderly populations. Sildenafil, the active ingredient in Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, has not been tested over long periods of time in older or elderly women. Older or elderly women may react differently and adversely to Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% and we have not yet thoroughly studied the topical or clinical pharmacology of this drug candidate in different patient populations. Should Sildenafil\nCream, 3.6% show increased risk of adverse reactions, or signs thereof, in older or elderly women, our business prospects could be harmed.\nWe face intense competition from other medical device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe medical device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive. Significant competition exists among contraceptive products, therapies to treat BV and products for managing the vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. We anticipate new products will be developed and introduced by others in the future. Existing products have name recognition, are marketed by companies with established commercial infrastructures and with greater financial, technical and personnel resources than us. To compete and gain market share, any new product will need to demonstrate advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability or safety. In addition, new products developed by others could emerge as competitors to our product candidates and offer advantages and benefits over our product candidates. If we cannot compete effectively against our competitors, our business will not grow, and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nOur potential competitors include large, well-established pharmaceutical companies and specialty pharmaceutical companies, many of which have a robust product portfolio and strong franchises in women\u2019s health. These companies include Merck & Co., Inc., AMAG, Inc., TherapeuticsMD, Inc., Cooper Surgical, Inc., Agile Therapeutics, Inc., Allergan, Inc., Bayer AG, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer Inc. Additionally, several generic manufacturers currently market and continue to introduce new contraceptive and other products in women's health including Sandoz International GmbH, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Mylan, Inc., Perrigo Company, PLC and Amneal. Pharmaceuticals LLC. Other product candidates in development, if approved, could compete with our products.\nAny of our current or future product candidates for which we pursue clinical development, may cause serious adverse events or undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require our product to be taken off the market, require it to include safety warnings or otherwise limit our sales.\nSerious adverse events or undesirable side effects from our current product candidates and any future product candidates we may seek to develop, could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after approval and commercialization. The results of future clinical trials may show that a product candidate causes serious adverse events or undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay, or cause the termination of clinical trials, resulting in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. If such serious adverse events or undesirable side effects occur:\n\u2022\nduring the clinical development phase, regulatory authorities may impose a clinical hold which could result in substantial delays and adversely impact our ability to continue development of the product;\n\u2022\nduring the commercial or post-marketing phase regulatory authorities may require the addition of specific warnings or contraindications to product labeling or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022\nwe may have to change the way the product is administered or the labeling of the product;\n\u2022\nwe may have to conduct additional clinical trials with more patients or over longer periods of time than anticipated;\n\u2022\nwe may have to implement a risk minimization action plan, which could result in substantial cost increases and have a negative impact on our ability to commercialize the product;\n\u2022\nwe may have to limit the patients who can receive the product;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to promotional and marketing limitations on the product;\n\u2022\nsales of the product may decrease significantly;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require us to take an approved product off the market;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of current or future product candidates, or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from product sales.\nThe women's health market includes many generic products and the growth in generics is expected to continue, making the introduction of a branded product for contraception, BV and hormone replacement therapy difficult and expensive.\nThe proportion of the U.S. market made up of generic products has been increasing. In 2017, approximately 86% of the prescription volume consisted of unbranded generic products (source: IQVIA, Global Generic and Biosimilars Trends and Insights, February 13, 2018). If this trend continues, it may be more difficult for us to introduce a new branded product, if approved, at a price that will maximize our revenue and profits. Generic competition is particularly strong in the areas of contraception and the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. In order for Ovaprene and DARE-BV-1 to develop commercial markets, they must demonstrate better patient compliance and a clinical benefit in their trials in order for insurers to cover these higher cost products.\nThere may be additional marketing and educational efforts required to introduce a new product in order to overcome the trend towards generics and to gain access to reimbursement by payors. If we cannot introduce a product, if approved, at our desired price, if we cannot gain reimbursement from payors for an approved product, or if patients opt for a lower cost generic product and are unwilling to pay out-of-pocket or a co-pay, our revenues will be limited.\nChanges in health care laws and regulations may eliminate current requirements that health insurance plans cover and reimburse FDA-cleared or approved contraceptive products without cost sharing, which could reduce demand for branded products such as Ovaprene and lead to a preference for generic options. If the out-of-pocket costs for Ovaprene are deemed by women to be high, a commercial market may never develop.\nIf approved, we cannot be certain that third-party reimbursement will be available for Ovaprene, and even if reimbursement is available, the amount of any such reimbursement. The ACA and subsequent regulations enacted by the Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, require health plans to provide coverage for women\u2019s preventive care, including all forms of FDA-cleared or approved contraception, without imposing any cost sharing on the plan beneficiary. These regulations ensure that women who wish to use an approved form of contraception may request it from their doctors and their health insurance plan must cover all costs associated with such products. These regulations may be modified, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. For example, certain members of the U.S. Federal Government have attempted and are continuing to attempt to repeal the ACA and corresponding regulations, which would likely eliminate the requirement for health plans to cover women\u2019s preventive care without cost sharing. Even if the ACA is not repealed, the DHHS regulations to specifically enforce the preventive health coverage mandate could be repealed or modified under the Trump Administration, which in 2017 altered the mandate to allow certain employers and insurers to opt out of birth control coverage for religious or moral reasons. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking, court decisions or other changes in the law. Any repeal or elimination of the preventive care coverage rules would mean that women seeking to use prescribed forms of contraceptives may have to pay some portion of the cost for such products out-of-pocket, which could deter some women from using prescription contraceptive products, such as Ovaprene, at all. As a result, we expect that our success will depend on the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket for Ovaprene in the event that either they do not have insurance or their insurance requires payment of a portion of Ovaprene by the patient, thus increasing the patient\u2019s overall cost to use Ovaprene. This could reduce market demand for Ovaprene or any other contraceptive candidates we may seek to develop, such as ORB 204, ORB 214 and DARE-RH1, if and when they receive FDA approval, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and prospects.\nAs no FDA-approved treatments for FSAD currently exist, there is no precedent to help assess whether health insurance plans will cover Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%.\nWe cannot be certain that third-party reimbursement will be available for Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%. Even if reimbursement becomes available, the amount of such reimbursement may not make our product affordable to women and profitable to us. Insurers may deem Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% to be a life-style drug and decide not to provide reimbursement. Today, many health insurance plans provide reimbursement for male sexual arousal medications. However, we cannot predict whether they will continue to do so or whether they will do so for female sexual arousal treatments as well. In addition, the safety and efficacy data from our clinical trials may impact whether Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% will become eligible for insurance coverage, and if it does, the level of such reimbursement. In an environment of rapidly rising health care costs, insurers have been looking for ways to reduce costs, which could make it difficult for new therapies to gain coverage if they are not deemed critical or essential to gain coverage. If Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% fails to obtain insurance coverage, or if the patient\u2019s share of the cost is deemed to be expensive, a market may never develop for Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere to market any of our products, the reimbursement environment at the time of approval may hurt our financial prospects.\nThird-party payers and administrators, including state Medicaid programs, Medicare, and the Veterans Health Administration, have recently been challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical and medical device products. The United States government and other third-party payers are increasingly limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and medical devices. Third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for the products we seek to commercialize. If such government and other third-party payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement, health care providers may not prescribe our products or patients may ask their health care providers to prescribe competing products with more favorable reimbursement.\nManaged care organizations and other private insurers frequently adopt their own payment or reimbursement reductions. Consolidation among managed care organizations has increased the negotiating power of these entities. Private third-party payers, as well as governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for the products we seek to commercialize or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing levels, could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nThe pharmaceutical and medical device industries are highly regulated and subject to various fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the U.S. federal False Claims Act and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nHealth care fraud and abuse regulations are complex, and even minor irregularities can give rise to claims that a statute or prohibition has been violated. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal health care programs\u2019 anti-kickback law (and comparable state laws), which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Health programs;\n\u2022\nfederal and state false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, or other third-party payers;\n\u2022\nHIPAA (and similar state laws), which mandates, among other things, the adoption of standards to enhance the efficiency and simplify the administration of the health care system, as well as to protect the confidentiality of protected health information and electronic protected health information;\n\u2022\nThe ACA\u2019s reporting requirements for pharmaceutical, biologic and device manufacturers regarding payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, including investment interests in such manufacturers held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year; and\n\u2022\nthe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits corrupt payments, gifts or transfers of value to non-U.S. officials.\nThe scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of health care reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Regulatory authorities might challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with these laws will involve substantial costs. Any investigation of us or the third parties with whom we contract, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time consuming.\nOur success relies on third-party suppliers and manufacturers of our product candidates, including multiple single source suppliers and manufacturers.\nWe have a small number of employees and no personnel dedicated to marketing, manufacturing or sales and distribution. If we receive the requisite regulatory approvals for one or more products, we expect to rely on third parties to manufacture such products, and as such we will be subject to inherent uncertainties related to product safety, availability and security. For example, our agreement with ADVA-Tec limits our ability to engage a manufacturing source for Ovaprene other than ADVA-Tec following regulatory approval. If ADVA-Tec fails to produce sufficient ring quantities to meet commercial demand, our ability to become profitable could be adversely impacted. To date, ADVA-Tec has only produced a small number of rings for clinical testing. Furthermore, for some of the key raw materials and components of Ovaprene, we have only a single source of supply, and alternate sources of supply may not be readily available.\nUnder the terms of the SST license agreement, SST will be responsible for obtaining supplies of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% for the Phase 2 clinical trials expected to be conducted in the United States. Thereafter, we will be responsible for obtaining pre-clinical, clinical and commercial supplies of Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%. Under the terms of the license arrangements for our other clinical-stage candidates; DARE-BV1 and DARE-HRT1, we will be responsible for sourcing the supply of the active ingredients and arranging for the manufacture of the hydrogel and IVRs. The supply of all of our product candidates, including Ovaprene and Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, will rely on third party sources and suppliers.\nMoreover, we do not expect to control the manufacturing processes for the production of any current or future products or product candidates, all of which must be made in accordance with relevant regulations, and includes, among other things, quality control, quality assurance, compliance with cGMP and the maintenance of records and documentation. In the future, it is possible that our suppliers or manufacturers may fail to comply with FDA regulations, the requirements of other regulatory bodies or our own requirements, any of which would result in suspension or prevention of commercialization and/or manufacturing of our products or product candidates, suspension of ongoing research, disqualification of data or other enforcement actions such as product recall, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecutions against us. Furthermore, we may be unable to replace any supplier or manufacturer with an alternate supplier or manufacturer on a commercially reasonable or timely basis, or at all. If we are unable to obtain the product quantities needed for our clinical trials, and if approved, for commercial launch, our business will be materially adversely affected.\nIf we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply, or if any supplier or manufacturer were unable to meet its demand for our product candidates, we could experience delays in research, planned clinical trials or commercialization. We might not find alternative suppliers or manufacturers with FDA approval, of acceptable quantity, in the appropriate volumes and at an acceptable cost. The long transition periods necessary to switch manufacturers and suppliers would significantly delay our timelines, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nThird-party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors or regulatory service providers may not perform as agreed or may terminate their agreements with us. Any significant problem that our suppliers, manufacturers, distributors or regulatory service providers experience could delay or interrupt our supply of materials or product candidates until the supplier, manufacturer, distributor or regulatory service provider cures the problem or until we locate, negotiate for, validate and receive FDA approval for an alternative provider (when necessary), if one is available. Failure to obtain the needed quantities of our products would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results from operations and prospects.\nWe have no internal sales, marketing or distribution capabilities and our model is to partner with companies with existing sales franchises to sell and distribute our products, if approved. Any failure by such third parties could negatively impact our business and our ability to develop and market any approved products.\nWe currently do not intend to directly sell or distribute our products into the market and instead intend to enter into agreements with third parties to sell and distribute our products. This reliance on third parties will subject us to uncertainties related to these services including the quality of such services. Further, we would depend on these distributors and partners to ensure that the distribution process accords with relevant regulations, which includes, among other things, compliance with current good documentation practices, the maintenance of records and documentation, and compliance with applicable state laws that govern the licensure of distributors of prescription medical products. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in significant remedial action, including improvement of facilities, suspension of distribution or recall of product. Furthermore, we may be unable to replace any such partner or distributor with an alternate party on a commercially reasonable or timely basis, or at all.\nAdditionally, any failure by us to forecast demand for a finished product, and failure by us to ensure our distributors and marketing partners have appropriate capacity to distribute and sell such quantities of finished product, could result in an interruption in the supply of certain products and a decline in sales of that product.\nWe intend to rely on third parties for the execution of certain development programs for our current and any future product candidates. Failure of these third parties to provide services of a suitable quality and within acceptable timeframes may cause the delay or failure of our development programs.\nOur business model relies on the outsourcing of certain functions, tests and services to CROs, medical institutions and other specialist providers. We rely on these third parties to run all aspects of our clinical trials and related programs, and for quality assurance, clinical monitoring, clinical data management and regulatory expertise related to these clinical development programs. For example, we engaged a CRO to run all aspects of the PCT clinical trial for Ovaprene, and we intend to engage one or more CROs for all future clinical trial requirements needed to file for regulatory approvals. We expect to rely on third parties and CROs to perform similar functions for Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, DARE-BV1, DARE-HRT1 and any future product candidates. There is no assurance that such organizations or individuals will\nbe able to provide the functions, tests or services as agreed upon, including the agreed upon price and timeline, or to our requisite quality. We will rely on the efforts of these organizations and individuals and if they fail to perform as expected, we could suffer significant delays in the development of one or more of our product candidates.\nThere is also no assurance these third parties will not make errors in the design, management or retention of our data or data systems. Any failures by such third parties could lead to a loss of data, which in turn could lead to delays in clinical development and obtaining regulatory approval. Third parties may not pass FDA or other regulatory audits, which could delay or prohibit regulatory approval. In addition, the cost of such services could significantly increase over time. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, regulatory approval of current and future product candidates, may be delayed, prevented or cost significantly more than expected, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe commercial success of our current product candidates and any future product candidates will significantly depend on the label claims that the FDA or other regulatory authorities approve for the product.\nThe commercial success of any of our product candidates will significantly depend upon our ability to obtain approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities of product labeling containing adequate information regarding a product candidate\u2019s expected features or benefits. Failure to achieve such approval will prevent or substantially limit our ability to advertise and promote such features and benefits in order to differentiate DARE-BV1, Ovaprene, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, DARE-HRT1, the other product candidates currently in our portfolio or any future product candidate from competing products. This failure would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nEven if we receive approval from the FDA in the United States to market our current or any future product candidates we may seek to develop, we may fail to receive similar approval outside the United States.\nTo market a new product outside the United States, we must obtain separate marketing approvals in each jurisdiction and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries, including clinical trials, commercial sales, pricing, manufacturing, distribution and safety requirements. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from, and be longer than, that required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval process in other countries may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval in the United States, as well as other risks. Further, we may not obtain rights to the necessary clinical data in other countries and may have to develop our own. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, a new product must receive pricing and reimbursement approval prior to commercialization. This can result in substantial delays in these countries. Additionally, the product labeling requirements outside the United States may be different and inconsistent with the United States labeling requirements, negatively affecting our ability to market our products in countries outside the United States.\nIn addition, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution if we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements. In such an event, our ability to market to our full target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDARE-FRT1, DARE-OAB1, DARE-VVA1, DARE-RH1, ORB-204 and ORB-214 are in pre-clinical stages of development.\nPre-clinical studies refer to a stage of research that begins before clinical trials (testing in humans) can begin, and during which important feasibility, iterative testing and drug safety data are collected. Because of their early nature, pre-clinical product candidates tend to carry a higher risk of failure as compared with clinical-stage assets. Pre-clinical candidates must generate sufficient safety and efficacy data through in vitro studies, animal studies and a variety of tests before they can be considered appropriate for testing in humans. The development risks, timeline and cost of pre-clinical assets can be high because of the unknowns and absence of data. It can be difficult to identify relevant tests and animal models for pre-clinical studies. Even if the results from our pre-clinical studies are favorable, we still may not be able to advance the candidates into clinical trials. If pre-clinical studies of product candidates do not generate strong data, DARE-FRT1, DARE-OAB1, DARE-VVA1, DARE-RH1, ORB-204 and ORB-214 may never progress to clinical development and may prove to be worthless.\nOur business may be adversely affected by unfavorable macroeconomic conditions.\nVarious macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business, our results of operations and financial condition, including changes in inflation, interest rates and overall economic conditions and uncertainties, including those resulting from political instability (including workforce uncertainty) and the current and future conditions in the global financial markets.\nInterest rates and the ability to access credit markets could also adversely affect the ability of patients, payers and distributors to purchase, pay for and effectively distribute our products, if and when approved. Similarly, these macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our current or potential future third-party manufacturers, sole source or single source suppliers, licensors or licensees to remain in business, or otherwise manufacture or supply our clinical trial material and products, if and when approved. Failure by any of them to remain in business could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for DARE-BV1, Ovaprene, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, DARE-HRT1, or any of our other current or any future product candidates, and, if approved, to provide sufficient quantities of our products to meet market demand.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur failure to adequately protect or enforce our and our licensors\u2019 intellectual property rights could materially harm our proprietary position in the marketplace or prevent or impede the commercialization of our current and potential future products.\nOur success depends in part on our ability, and the ability of our licensors, to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and other countries for the intellectual property covering or incorporated into our technologies and products. The patents and patent applications relied upon by us are licensed to us by third parties. Our ability, or the ability of our licensors, to protect our product candidates from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties depends substantially on our abilities and the abilities of such licensors to obtain and maintain, or license, valid and enforceable patents. Due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents, our ability, and that of our licensors, to obtain or enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved. As a result, the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, we do not know whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications. We or our licensors may not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions.\nWe cannot be certain if any of the patents that cover our product candidates will be eligible to be listed in the FDA\u2019s compendium of \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluation\" (the \u201cOrange Book\"). The advantage of being listed in the Orange Book is that, under Hatch-Waxman, any future generic applicant for any of our approved products needs to include a patent certification in their generic application with respect to each patent listed in the Orange Book for an approved product (referred to as the \u201clisted drug\u201d) for which they are seeking approval. If the generic applicant believes that any of the patents in the Orange Book on the listed drug is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed by their product, the generic applicant usually will file a \u201cParagraph IV\u201d certification on that patent if they plan to challenge the patent. When a generic applicant files a Paragraph IV certification, they must provide the listed drug application (and the patent owner if different) a notice that they filed a generic application with the Paragraph IV certification. If, in reply to that notice, the listed drug holder files a patent lawsuit against the generic applicant within 45 days of the Paragraph IV notice, a 30-month automatic stay is imposed by Hatch-Waxman on FDA during which FDA may not approve the generic application (unless the patent litigation is resolved in the generic applicant\u2019s favor). These 30-month stays are major protection available in Hatch-Waxman for innovative drug makers. However, if our products are approved, but one or more of our patents are not listed in the Orange Book, generic firms that might seek approval of a generic version of our product would not have to \u201ccertify\u201d in their generic drug applications as to any such unlisted patent. This could result in the absence of a 30-month stay and thus faster approval of some generic applications for our products.\nOther companies or individuals may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as U.S. laws, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our proprietary rights in these countries. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies, product candidates and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nOur patent strategy for protecting DARE-BV1 includes in-licensing a patent family from TriLogic Pharma and MilanaPharm whose last claim expires in the fourth quarter of 2028 in the United States and Europe, with additional patent applications pending that could have terms into 2036. MilanaPharm has the first right to prepare, file, prosecute and maintain all such patents, at MilanaPharm\u2019s sole cost and expense. MilanaPharm and TriLogic must keep us informed regarding the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of the licensed patents, provide us with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on material communications to and from the applicable patent authorities and take all reasonable comments made by, and otherwise act in accordance with instructions provided by, us on matters related to prosecution, maintenance and enforcement related to the licensed patents. If MilanaPharm decides not to prepare, file, prosecute, or maintain any licensed patent, we have the option, in our sole discretion, to assume the control and\ndirection of the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of such patent at our expense, and we may deduct some or all of such patent expenses from amounts payable to MilanaPharm under our license agreement.\nOur patent strategy for protecting Ovaprene includes in-licensing a patent family from ADVA-Tec, whose last claim expires in August 2028, but which could be extended to August 2033 in the United States and Europe. Patent prosecution for the intellectual property incorporated into Ovaprene is entirely controlled by ADVA-Tec and we have little, if any, influence or control over such patent prosecution.\nOur patent strategy for protecting Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% includes in-licensing a patent family from SST, whose last U.S. claim expires in June 2029, but which could be eligible for three-year market exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States. However, if granted 3-year exclusivity, generic applicants can still submit an abbreviated application during the 3-year period and FDA is required to review the application, but will defer any approval until the end of the 3-year period. Three-year exclusivity differs from 5-year exclusivity under Hatch-Waxman, which bars the submission of a generic application during the 5-year period, with the exception that a generic application can be filed after 4 years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification challenging an Orange Book-listed patent for the brand drug.\nWith respect to patents related to Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, SST has the sole right, but not the obligation, to prepare, file, prosecute and maintain such patents. We will be responsible for the costs incurred to maintain and prosecute all such patents and we will be kept informed of all strategies. However, we will have little if any, influence or control over implementing the patent strategy.\nWith respect to patent rights related to our IVR product candidates, including DARE-HRT1, The General Hospital Corporation (known as MGH) has the sole right to prosecute and maintain its patent rights, and we have the right to prosecute and maintain Juniper\u2019s patent rights. We will be responsible for the costs incurred by MGH to maintain and prosecute such patents and we will be kept informed of all strategies. However, we will have little, if any, influence or control over MGH\u2019s implementation of the patent strategy.\nWith respect to patents related to DARE-VVA1, we have the right and obligation, at our expense, to prosecute and maintain the in-licensed patent rights in certain major markets, if possible.\nThere is a substantial backlog of patent applications at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. There can be no assurance that any patent applications relating to our products or methods will be issued as patents or, if issued, that the patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide a competitive advantage. We and our licensors may not obtain patent rights on products, treatment methods or manufacturing processes that we may develop or to which we may obtain license or other rights. Even if patents are issued to us and our licensors, rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection for our product candidates or provide sufficient protection to afford us a commercial advantage against our competitors or their competitive products or processes. It is possible that no patents will be issued from any pending or future patent applications owned by us or licensed to us. Others may challenge, seek to invalidate, infringe or circumvent any patents we own or license, including the patents we have licensed to date and any other patents we may license in the future. Conversely, in the future we may have to initiate litigation against third parties to enforce our intellectual property rights. The defense and prosecution of patent and intellectual property claims are both costly and time consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. Any adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to license disputed rights from others or require us to cease selling our future products.\nIn addition, many other organizations are engaged in research and product development efforts that may overlap with our products. Such organizations may currently have, or may obtain in the future, legally blocking proprietary rights, including patent rights, in one or more products or methods we are developing or considering for development. These rights may prevent us from commercializing technology, or they may require us to obtain a license from the organizations to use the technology. We may not obtain any such licenses that may be required on reasonable financial terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the patents underlying any such licenses will be valid or enforceable. As with other companies in the pharmaceutical industry, we are subject to the risks that persons located in other countries will engage in development, marketing or sales activities of products that would infringe our intellectual property rights if such activities were conducted in the United States and enforcing our intellectual property rights against such persons may be difficult or not possible.\nOur patents and other intellectual property also may not afford protection against competitors with similar technology. We may not have identified all patents, published applications or published literature that affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our product candidates, by preventing the patentability of our products or by covering the same or similar technologies that may affect our ability to market or license our product candidates. Many companies have encountered difficulties in protecting and defending their intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. If we encounter such difficulties or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in either the United States or foreign jurisdictions, our business prospects could be substantially harmed.\nIn addition, because of funding limitations and our limited cash resources, we may not be able to devote the resources that we might otherwise desire to prepare or pursue patent applications, either at all or in all jurisdictions in which we might desire to obtain patents, or to maintain already-issued patents.\nThe patents and the patent applications covering Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% and DARE-BV1 are limited to specific formulations, processes and uses of sildenafil and clindamycin, and our market opportunity may be limited by the lack of patent protection for the active ingredient itself and other formulations and delivery technology and systems that may be developed by competitors.\nThe active ingredient in our product candidate for FSAD, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, is sildenafil and the active ingredient in our product candidate for the treatment of BV, DARE-BV1, is clindamycin. Patent protection for these ingredients has expired and generic products are available. As a result, a competitor that obtains the requisite regulatory approvals could offer products with the same active ingredient in a different formulation so long as the competitor does not infringe any process, use or formulation patents that we have developed, or that may not be barred by any three-year Waxman-Hatch exclusivity we might enjoy upon approval of our products.\nCompetitors may seek to develop and market competing formulations that may not be covered by our patents and patent applications. The commercial opportunity for Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% and DARE-BV1 could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop and commercialize alternative formulations using these ingredients.\nThe patents and the patent applications covering our IVR product candidates cover the method of delivery and the device and our market opportunity may be limited by the lack of patent protection for the active ingredients themselves and other formulations, delivery technology and systems that may be developed by competitors.\nThe active ingredients in our IVR product candidates include bio-identical progesterone, estrogen and oxybutynin, and none of those ingredients are proprietary to us. As a result, we must compete with currently available products and any future products developed by competitors using same active ingredients in a different formulation or via a different delivery system. The commercial opportunity for our IVR product candidates, including DARE-HRT1 for hormone replacement therapy, could be significantly harmed if competitors develop and commercialize alternative formulations or better delivery approaches.\nThe patents and the patent applications covering the use and delivery of DARE-VVA1 and our market opportunity may be limited by the lack of patent protection for the active ingredient itself and other formulations, delivery technology and systems that may be developed by competitors.\nThe active ingredient in DARE-VVA1, tamoxifen, is not proprietary to us. As a result, we must compete with currently available products and any future products developed by competitors using the same active ingredient in a different formulation or via a different delivery system. The commercial opportunity for our product candidate for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy could be significantly harmed if competitors develop and commercialize alternative formulations or better delivery approaches.\nWe may become involved in patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings relating to our future product approvals, which could result in liability for damages or delay or stop our development and commercialization efforts.\nThe pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by significant litigation and other proceedings regarding patents, patent applications, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. The situations in which we may become party to such litigation or proceedings may include any third parties initiating litigation claiming that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights, or that one of our trademarks or trade names infringes the third party\u2019s trademark rights; in such case, we would need to defend against such proceedings. The costs of resolving any patent litigation or other intellectual property proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Many of our potential competitors will be able to sustain the cost of such litigation and proceedings more effectively than us because of their substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace, our financial condition and our stock price. Patent litigation and other intellectual property proceedings may also consume significant management time.\nIf a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, including any rights licensed by us, enforcing those rights may be costly, difficult and time-consuming. Even if successful, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time-consuming and could divert our management\u2019s attention. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patent or other intellectual property rights against a challenge. If we were unsuccessful in enforcing and protecting our intellectual property rights and protecting our products, it could materially harm our business.\nWith respect to DARE-BV1, we have the initial right to enforce patents we license from TriLogic and MilanaPharm against third parties whose activities infringe such patents in a manner that could affect our exercise of the licenses granted to us, and TriLogic and MilanaPharm must reasonably cooperate with in any such suit, including, if necessary, by being joined as a party to any such suit. In some cases, MilanaPharm may assume the defense of a claim initiated by a third-party alleging infringement of a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights as a result of the manufacture or sale of a product we develop under our license agreement with TriLogic/MilanaPharm. While our license agreement would require MilanaPharm to indemnify us for certain losses arising from these third-party claims, this indemnification may not be sufficient to adequately compensate us for any related losses or the potential loss of our ability to manufacture and sell DARE-BV1.\nWith respect to Ovaprene, ADVA-Tec has the right, in certain instances, to control the defense against any infringement litigation arising from the manufacture or development (but not the sale) of Ovaprene. While our license agreement with ADVA-Tec requires ADVA-Tec to indemnify us for certain losses arising from these claims, this indemnification may not be sufficient to adequately compensate us for any related losses or the potential loss of our ability to manufacture and develop Ovaprene.\nWith respect to Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, we have the initial right to enforce the applicable licensed patents against infringers in the field of use where a third party is exploiting a topically applied pharmaceutical product that contains at least one of the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as a licensed product, and SST will provide us with reasonable assistance (excluding financial assistance), at our expense. We also have the initial right to defend any claim initiated by any third-party alleging that a licensed product developed or commercialized under the SST license agreement has infringed any third party intellectual property rights. While the SST license agreement requires SST to indemnify us for certain losses arising from these claims, this indemnification may not be sufficient to adequately compensate us for any related losses or the potential loss of our ability to manufacture and develop Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%.\nWith respect to our IVR product candidates, including DARE-HRT1, we have the first right to enforce the applicable licensed patents against third party infringers in the fields of pharmaceutical, therapeutic, preventative, diagnostic and palliative uses.\nWith respect to DARE-VVA1, we have the first right to enforce the applicable licensed patents against third party infringers in all fields.\nOur exclusive, in-license agreements covering the critical patents and related intellectual property related to DARE-BV1, Ovaprene, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, our IVR product candidates, including DARE-HRT1, and other product candidates we may acquire or license impose significant monetary obligations and other requirements that may adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan. The termination of any of these in-license agreements could prevent us from developing and commercializing our drug candidates and may harm our business.\nOur license agreements with Hammock/MilanaPharm, ADVA-Tec, Strategic Science and Juniper Pharmaceuticals include intellectual property rights to DARE-BV1, Ovaprene, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, and our IVR product candidates, including DARE-HRT1, respectively. These agreements, as well as our merger agreement with Pear Tree, require us, as a condition to the maintenance of our license and other rights, and as merger consideration in the case of the agreement with Pear Tree, to make milestone and royalty payments and satisfy certain performance obligations. Our obligations under these in-license agreements impose significant financial and logistical burdens upon our ability to carry out our business plan. Furthermore, if we do not meet such obligations in a timely manner, and, in the case of milestone payment requirements, if we were unable to obtain an extension of the deadlines for meeting such payment requirements, we could lose the rights to these proprietary technologies, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, there is no assurance that the existing license agreements covering the rights related to DARE-BV1, Ovaprene, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, and the IVR product candidates, or license agreements we enter into or acquire the rights to in the future, will not be terminated due to a material breach of the underlying agreements.\nWith regard to the agreement covering Ovaprene, this would include a failure on our part to make milestone and royalty payments, our failure to obtain applicable approvals from governmental authorities, or the loss of rights to the underlying intellectual property by any such licensors. With regard to the agreement covering Sildenafil Cream, 3.6%, this would include a failure to assume responsibility for suspended development activities within the requisite period, our failure to use commercially reasonable efforts in performing development activities, or the failure on our part to make milestone and royalty payments.\nWith regards to the agreement covering DARE-BV1, this would include failure to use commercially reasonable efforts and resources to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product or process in the United States and at least one licensed product or process in at least one of Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany,\nItaly or Spain, our failure to make milestone and royalty payments, or our failure to continue, or to resume, using commercially reasonable marketing efforts to sell a licensed product or process in a country after having launched such product or process in that country. With regard to the agreement covering our IVR product candidates, this would include a failure on our part to make milestone and royalty payments, our failure to obtain applicable approvals from governmental authorities or the loss of rights to the underlying intellectual property by any such licensors. With regard to the merger agreement with Pear Tree, this would include our failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring a product to market.\nMoreover, because some of our rights to DARE-BV1, Ovaprene, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% and the IVR product candidates are sublicensed pursuant to underlying agreements, there is no assurance that the existing license agreements covering the rights related to DARE-BV1, Ovaprene, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% , and DARE-HRT1 will not be terminated due to termination of the underlying agreements, or due to the loss of rights to the underlying intellectual property by Hammock's, ADVA-Tec\u2019s, SST\u2019s or Juniper Pharmaceutical's licensors. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew or renegotiate license agreements on acceptable terms if our license agreements with Hammock, ADVA-Tec, SST, TriLogic/MilanaPharm or Juniper Pharmaceuticals, or the underlying agreements are terminated. We cannot guarantee that any license agreement will be enforceable. The termination of these license agreements or our inability to enforce our rights under these license agreements would materially and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize DARE-BV1, Ovaprene, Sildenafil Cream, 3.6% and our IVR product candidates, including DARE-HRT1.\nWe may also rely on trade secrets to protect some of our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, we or any of our collaborators\u2019 employees, consultants, contractors or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors and we may not have adequate remedies in respect of that disclosure. Enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. In addition, foreign courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. If our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, we would not be able to assert our trade secrets against them and our business could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and could subject us to securities litigation, including class-action lawsuits.\nThe stock market in general, and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The stocks of small cap and microcap companies in the biotechnology sector like ours tend to be highly volatile. We expect that the price of our common stock will be highly volatile for the next several years as we undertake studies and trials to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nfailure or discontinuation of any of our research programs;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated results from, and any delays in commencement or completion of, any clinical trials, as well as results of regulatory reviews relating to the approval of any product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe level of expenses related to development of our current and future product candidates, and in particular our clinical development programs;\n\u2022\ncommencement or termination of any collaboration or licensing arrangement;\n\u2022\nthe results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license product candidates or products, if any;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures and capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nnew products, product candidates or new uses for existing products introduced or announced by our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of product candidates of our competitors;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of health care payment systems;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in earnings estimates, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us or our stockholders in the future, as well as the overall trading volume of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in companies\u2019 stock prices, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against such companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue satisfying the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. To maintain our listing we are required to satisfy continued listing requirements. For example, on November 30, 2018, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the \u201cNasdaq Staff\u201d) of the Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) notifying us that we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the closing bid price for our common stock was less than $1.00 for the last 30 consecutive business days. On April 1, 2019, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Staff notifying us that we regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the closing bid price of our common stock was $1.00 per share or greater for the 10 consecutive business day period from March 18, 2019 to March 29, 2019 and that the matter is now closed.\nThere can be no assurance we will continue satisfying the Nasdaq continued listing requirements, which include that the closing bid price of our common stock be at least $1 per share, that we have at least 300 public holders and at least 500,000 publicly held shares, that the market value of our publicly held shares be at least $1 million, and that we meet one of these standards: stockholders' equity of at least $2.5 million; market value of listed securities of at least $35 million; or net income from continuing operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the three most recently completed fiscal years. The delisting of our common stock for whatever reason could, among other things, substantially impair our ability to raise additional capital; result in the loss of interest from institutional investors, the loss of confidence in our company by investors and employees, and in fewer financing, strategic and business development opportunities; and result in potential breaches of agreements under which we made representations or covenants relating to our compliance with applicable listing requirements. Claims related to any such breaches, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, significant liabilities and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations. In addition, the delisting of our common stock for whatever reason may materially impair our stockholders\u2019 ability to buy and sell shares of our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock.\nPre-clinical product candidates may not be valued by investors and may be difficult to fund.\nGiven their early stage of development and the lack of data, many pre-clinical assets are often perceived as having low valuations by investors and pharmaceutical companies. Our investment of time and resources in such assets may not be appreciated or valued. As a result, it may be difficult for us to fund such programs. If our IVR product candidates, DARE-VVA1, DARE-RH1 or the injectable etonogestrel product candidates we may license from Orbis fail to be valued, our stock price may be adversely affected.\nOur executive officers and directors and their affiliates own a significant percentage of our issued and outstanding common stock and are able to exercise significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nAs of March 29, 2019, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 20% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they could exert a significant degree of influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, could have significant influence on\nthe election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, including a transaction on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares of common stock may be sold into the public market at any point, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time, either by us or our stockholders. For example, we sold an aggregate of 375,000 shares of our common stock in at-the-market offerings that closed in January and February 2018, and we sold 5.0 million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to 3.72 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering that closed in February 2018. These sales, or the perception in the market that we or holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Our outstanding shares of common stock may be freely sold in the public market at any time to the extent permitted by Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act or to the extent such shares have already been registered under the Securities Act and are held by non-affiliates.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there were 1,635,790 shares of our common stock subject to outstanding options, of which 1,625,641 have been registered under the Securities Act on Form S-8. The shares so registered can be freely sold in the public market after being issued to the option holder upon exercise, except to the extent they are held by an affiliate of ours, in which case such shares will become eligible for sale in the public market as permitted by Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2018, there were 3.75 million shares of our common stock subject to outstanding warrants to purchase common stock. To the extent these warrants are exercised, the shares underlying these warrants may be immediately sold in the public market.\nThe sale of our common stock through our ATM sales agreement may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders, and such sales, or the anticipation of such sales, may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIn January 2018, we entered into a common stock sales agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, in connection with an \u201cat the market\u201d offering, under which, from time to time, we may offer and sell up to an aggregate of $10.0 million of shares of our common stock. We call that sales agreement our \u201cATM sales agreement.\u201d As of December 31, 2018, up to $8.9 million remained available for us to sell under the ATM sales agreement. Although we have the right to control whether we sell any shares, if at all, under the ATM sales agreement, and the timing and amount of sales of our shares thereunder, we are subject to certain restrictions, including, without limitation, our inability to sell, during any 12-month period, securities having an aggregate market value of not more than one-third of our public float, pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3. Accordingly, we may not be able to sell shares of our common stock under the ATM sales agreement when we desire. However, to the extent we do sell shares of our common stock under the ATM sales agreement, such sales may result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders, and such sales, or the anticipation of such sales, may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nThe exercise of our outstanding options and warrants may result in significant dilution to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding options to purchase up to 1.64 million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to 3.75 million shares of our common stock. The exercise of a significant portion of our outstanding options and/or warrants may result in significant dilution to our stockholders.\nThe warrants we issued in February 2018 contain anti-dilution provisions that could prevent us from obtaining additional financing.\nThe warrants to purchase up to 3.72 million shares of our common stock we issued and sold in the underwritten public offering that closed in February 2018 (the \u201cFebruary 2018 Warrants\u201d) include price-based anti-dilution provisions. As of March 29, 2019, the exercise price of the February 2018 Warrants was $3.00 per share and the closing price of our common stock on that date was $1.40. Under the terms of the February 2018 warrants, subject to certain limited exceptions, their exercise price will be reduced each time we issue or sell (or are deemed to issue or sell) any securities, including under the ATM sales agreement, for a consideration per share less than a price equal to the exercise price of the February 2018 Warrants in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale). If we issue shares of our common stock for cash, the consideration received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount of consideration we received therefor. In addition, if we issue, sell or enter into any agreement to issue or sell securities at a price which varies or may vary with the market price of the shares of our common stock, the holders of the February 2018 Warrants will have the right to substitute such variable price for the exercise price of the February 2018 Warrants then in effect.\nThe overhang represented by the February 2018 warrants, coupled with the anti-dilution provisions of such warrants, may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital, because of the possible substantial dilution to any new purchaser of our securities and the ability of holders of the warrants to enter into short sales of our stock. Any potential new purchaser of our securities may choose to value our common stock in such a manner that takes into account the number of shares of our common stock that would be outstanding immediately following the exercise of all the February 2018 Warrants.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without stockholder approval, one or more series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, privileges, preferences, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, terms of redemption and relative participation, optional, or other rights, if any, of the shares of each such series of preferred stock and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as our Board of Directors may determine. The terms of one or more series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company through 2019. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will be permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u2022\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of its internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nnot being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u2022\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u2022\nexemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nIn addition, even when we are no longer an emerging growth company, for so long as our public float is less than $250 million, or our annual revenues are less than $100 million and our public float is less than $700 million, we may rely on the scaled disclosure requirements available to smaller reporting companies, which permit us to include less extensive disclosure than required of other reporting companies, particularly regarding executive compensation, and to provide audited financial statements for two fiscal years, in contrast to other reporting companies, which must provide audited financial statements for three fiscal years.\nWe may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to utilize this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future; capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain as a holder of our shares.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on any shares of our capital stock. We currently plan to retain all of our future earnings, if any, and all cash received from the sale of securities, the sale of assets or a strategic transaction to finance the growth and development of our business. Accordingly, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our common stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws or Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions might frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove the current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors such that all members of the board are not elected at one time;\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board or for proposing matters that can be acted on at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nauthorize the board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by the board; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of the charter or bylaws.\nIn addition, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of its voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This could discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us, whether or not it is desired by, or beneficial to, our stockholders.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage or fail to regularly publish reports on our business, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 14591, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CERU"}
