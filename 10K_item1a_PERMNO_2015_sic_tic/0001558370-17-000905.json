{"cik": "1657197", "company": "Cotiviti Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks and all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before purchasing our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, perhaps significantly, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business and future growth depend on our ability to successfully expand the scope of claims reviewed for, and cross-sell additional solutions to, our existing client base.\nWe expect a significant portion of our future revenue growth to come from expanding the scope of claims we review for, and cross-selling additional solutions to, our existing clients. Our efforts to do so may not be successful. If we are unable to successfully expand the scope of payments reviewed by our solutions for or cross-sell additional solutions to our existing clients, it could have a material adverse effect on our growth and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInternal improvements to healthcare claims and retail billing processes by our clients could reduce the need for, and revenue generated by, our solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide solutions that help our clients enhance payment accuracy in an increasingly complex environment. If our clients improve their healthcare claims and retail billing processes, demand for our solutions could be reduced. Since most of our contracts are performance fee-based, enhancement of client internal billing processes could reduce the revenue generated by our solutions. With enough time and investment, many of our clients may be able to reduce or resolve recurring payment process complexities and resulting payment inaccuracies. In addition, many of our clients also utilize third party or internal technology, systems and personnel that review transactions before we do, all of which are constantly updated and improved. As the skills, experience and resources of such technology, systems and personnel improve, they may be able to identify payment inaccuracies before using our solutions, which would reduce the payment inaccuracies identified by our solutions and our ability to generate related revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealthcare spending fluctuations, simplification of the healthcare delivery and reimbursement system, programmatic changes to the scope of benefits and limitations to payment integrity initiatives could reduce the need for and the price of our solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur solutions improve our clients\u2019 ability to accurately pay healthcare claims and prevent or recover inaccurate payments, which often are a result of complexities in the healthcare claims payment system. Although the healthcare benefit and payment system continues to grow in complexity due to factors such as increased regulation and increased healthcare enrollment, the need for our solutions, the price clients are willing to pay for them and/or the scope and profitability of the solutions that we provide to our clients could be negatively affected by, among other things:\n\u00b7\nsimplification of the U.S. healthcare delivery and reimbursement systems, either through shifts in the commercial healthcare marketplace or through legislative or regulatory changes at the federal or state level;\n\u00b7\nreductions in the scope of private sector or government healthcare benefits (for example, decisions to eliminate coverage of certain services) or the possible repeal or restructuring of the Affordable Care Act;\n\u00b7\nthe transition of healthcare beneficiaries from fee-for-service plans to value-based plans;\n\u00b7\nthe adoption of healthcare plans with significantly higher deductibles;\n\u00b7\nlimits placed on payment integrity initiatives, including the Medicare RAC program; and\n\u00b7\nlower than projected growth in private health insurance or the various Medicare and Medicaid programs, including Medicare Advantage.\nAny of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our existing clients do not renew their agreements with us, renew at lower performance fee levels, choose to reduce the number of claims reviewed by our solutions, or prematurely terminate their agreement with us, and we are unable to replace any related lost revenue, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe historically have derived, and expect in the future to derive, a significant portion of our revenue from our existing clients and, accordingly, we are reliant on ongoing renewals of our agreements with existing clients. As a result, maintaining a high renewal rate is critical to our future growth and our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may experience significantly more difficulty than we anticipate in renewing our existing client agreements. Factors that may affect the renewal rate for our services and our ability to sell additional solutions include:\n\u00b7\nthe price, performance and functionality of our solutions;\n\u00b7\nthe availability, price, performance and functionality of competing solutions;\n\u00b7\nour clients\u2019 perceived ability to review claims accurately using their internal resources;\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop complementary solutions;\n\u00b7\nour continued ability to access the data necessary to enable us to effectively develop and deliver new solutions to clients;\n\u00b7\nthe stability and security of our platform;\n\u00b7\nchanges in healthcare laws, regulations or trends; and\n\u00b7\nthe business environment of our clients.\nContracts with our clients generally have stated terms of one to five years. Our clients have no obligation to renew their contracts for our services after the term expires. In addition, our clients may negotiate terms less advantageous to us upon renewal, may renew with a reduced scope of services, may choose to discontinue one or more services under an existing contract, may exercise flexibilities within their contracts to adjust service volumes, or may terminate the agreement prior to its contracted completion date, if any, which could reduce our revenue from these clients. If our clients fail to renew their agreements, renew their agreements upon less favorable terms, at lower performance fee levels or for fewer services, fail to purchase new services from us, or terminate their agreements with us, and we are unsuccessful in generating significant revenue from new or other existing clients to replace any lost revenue, our growth may be constrained and our revenue may decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to develop new client relationships, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of our strategy, we seek to develop new client relationships, principally among healthcare payers. Our ability to develop new relationships depends on a variety of factors, including the quality and performance of our solutions, as well as the ability to market and sell our solutions effectively and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. We may not be successful in developing new client relationships. If we are unable to develop new client relationships, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have long sales and implementation cycles for many of our solutions and if we fail to close sales after expending time and resources on the sales process, or if we experience delays in implementing the solutions we sell, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential clients generally perform a thorough evaluation of available payment accuracy solutions and require us to expend time, effort and money educating them as to the value of our solutions prior to entering into a contract with them. We may expend significant funds and management resources during the sales cycle and ultimately fail to close the sale. Our sales cycle may be extended due to our clients\u2019 budgetary constraints or for other reasons. In addition, following a successful sale, the implementation of our systems frequently involves a lengthy process, as we integrate our technology with the new client\u2019s technology and learn the new client\u2019s business, operations and billing processes and preferences. If we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending funds and management resources or if we experience delays in such sales or in implementing our solutions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSystem interruptions or failures could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur data and operations centers are essential to our business, which depends on our ability to maintain and protect our information systems. In addition, our operations are spread across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and India and we rely heavily on technology to communicate internally and efficiently perform our services. We have implemented measures that are designed to mitigate the potential adverse effects of a disruption, relocation or change in operating environment; however, we cannot provide assurance that the situations we plan for and the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain will be adequate in any particular case. In addition, despite system redundancy and security measures, our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other sources:\n\u00b7\npower loss, transmission cable cuts and telecommunications failures;\n\u00b7\ndamage or interruption caused by fire, earthquake and other natural disasters;\n\u00b7\nattacks by hackers or nefarious actors;\n\u00b7\nhuman error;\n\u00b7\ncomputer viruses and other malware, or software defects; and\n\u00b7\nphysical break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control.\nIf we encounter a business interruption, if we fail to effectively maintain our information systems, if it takes longer than we anticipate to complete required upgrades, enhancements or integrations or if our business continuity plans and business interruption insurance do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we could suffer operational disruptions, disputes with clients, civil or criminal penalties, regulatory problems, increases in administrative expenses, loss of our ability to produce timely and accurate financial and other reports or other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to innovate and develop new solutions, or if these new solutions are not adopted by existing and potential clients, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations and continued growth will depend on our ability to successfully develop and market new solutions that our existing and potential clients are willing to adopt. We cannot provide assurance that our new or modified solutions will be responsive to client preferences or industry changes, or that the product and service development initiatives we prioritize will yield the gains that we anticipate, if any.\nIf we are unable to predict market preferences or if our industry changes, or if we are unable to modify our solutions on a timely basis, we may lose clients or fail to attract new clients. If existing clients are not willing to adopt\nnew solutions, or if potential clients do not value such new solutions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe obtain and process a large amount of sensitive data. Our systems and networks may be subject to cyber-security breaches and other disruptions that could compromise our information. Any real or perceived improper use of, disclosure of, or access to such data could harm our reputation as a trusted brand, as well as have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use, obtain and process large amounts of confidential, sensitive and proprietary data, including PHI subject to regulation under HIPAA and PII subject to state and federal privacy, security and breach notification laws. The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We face risks associated with new personnel, as well as with new processes and technologies which are implemented from time to time to augment our security and privacy management programs. Our databases and systems, as well as those of our third party vendors, have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing and other cyber attacks. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks, however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third party vendors will prevent breaches or breakdowns to our or their databases or systems. If our security measures or those of the third party vendors we use who have access to this information are inadequate or are breached as a result of third party action, employee error, malfeasance, malware, phishing, hacking attacks, system error, trickery or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to sensitive information, including PHI and PII, on our systems or our providers\u2019 systems, our reputation and business could be damaged. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns to our or our third party vendors\u2019 databases or systems. The occurrence of any of these events could cause our solutions to be perceived as vulnerable, cause our clients to lose confidence in our solutions, negatively affect our ability to attract new clients and cause existing clients to terminate or not renew their use of our services and solutions. If the information is lost, improperly disclosed or threatened to be disclosed, we could incur significant liability and be subject to regulatory scrutiny and penalties. Furthermore, we could be forced to expend significant resources in response to a security breach, including investigating the cause of the breach, repairing system damage, increasing cyber-security protection costs by deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, notifying and providing credit monitoring to affected individuals, paying regulatory fines and litigating and resolving legal claims and regulatory actions, all of which could increase our expenses and divert the attention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations.\nIn addition, if our own confidential business information were improperly disclosed, our business could be materially adversely affected. A core aspect of our business is the reliability and security of our technology platform. Any perceived or actual breach of security could have a significant impact on our reputation as a trusted brand, cause us to lose existing clients, prevent us from obtaining new clients, require us to expend significant funds to remedy problems caused by breaches and to implement measures to prevent further breaches, and expose us to legal risk and potential liability. Any security breach at a third party vendor providing services to us could have similar effects. Any breach or disruption of any systems or networks on which we rely could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our activities present the potential for identity theft or similar illegal behavior by our employees or contractors with respect to third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur solutions involve the use and disclosure of personal information that in some cases could be used to impersonate third parties or otherwise improperly gain access to their data or funds. If any of our employees or contractors take, convert or misuse such information, or we experience a data breach creating a risk of identity theft, we could be liable for damages and our business reputation could be damaged. In addition, we could be perceived to have facilitated or participated in illegal misappropriation of documents or data and, therefore, be subject to civil or criminal liability. Federal and state regulators may take the position that a data breach or misdirection of data constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or trade practice. We also may be required to notify individuals affected by any data breaches. Further, a data breach or similar incident could impact the ability of our clients that are creditors to comply with the federal \u201cred flags\u201d rules, which require the implementation of identity theft prevention programs to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with client accounts, which could be costly to our clients and to us. If data utilized in our solutions are misappropriated for the purposes of identity theft or similar illegal behavior, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to provide our services and solutions, we often receive, process, transmit and store PHI and PII of individuals, as well as other financial, confidential and proprietary information belonging to our clients and third parties (e.g., private insurance companies, financial institutions, etc.). The receipt, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of this information is regulated at the federal, state, international and industry levels. We are also obligated under our contractual requirements with customers, who are themselves subject to extensive regulatory obligations and oversight. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to frequent change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. For example, as a result of the Omnibus Final Rule promulgated in 2013 pursuant to the HITECH Act, we became subject to direct federal regulation under HIPAA, which provides for governmental investigations, audits, enforcement actions and penalties.\nHIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit our use and disclosure of PHI and requires us to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI, as well as notify our covered entity customers of breaches of unsecured PHI and security incidents. HIPAA also imposes direct penalties on us for violations of its requirements. In addition to HIPAA, we are subject to varying state laws governing the use and disclosure of PII, including medical record information, as well as state laws requiring notification in case of a breach of such information. The Omnibus Final Rule significantly increased the risk of liability to us and our business associate subcontractors both by making us directly subject to many of HIPAA\u2019s requirements and by broadening the breach notification standard to make more incidents of inadvertent disclosure reportable and subject to penalties.\nWe act as a HIPAA \u201cbusiness associate\u201d to our covered entity customers because we collect, use, disclose and maintain PHI in order to provide services to these customers. HIPAA requires us to enter into satisfactory written business associate agreements with our covered entity customers, which contain specified written assurances that we will safeguard PHI that we create or access and will fulfill other material obligations. Under the Omnibus Final Rule, we may be held directly liable under our business associate agreements and HIPAA for any violations of HIPAA. Therefore, we could face liability to our customers under our contracts with them as well as liability to the government under HIPAA if we do not comply with our business associate obligations and those provisions of HIPAA that are applicable to us. While we take measures to comply with applicable laws and regulations as well as our own internally disseminated privacy and security policies, such laws, regulations and related legal standards for privacy and security continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards may result in threatened or actual proceedings, actions and public statements against us by government entities, private parties, consumer advocacy groups or others, or could cause us to lose clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The penalties for a violation of HIPAA are significant and, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have included protections in our contracts with our third party service providers as required by the Omnibus Final Rule, we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices. In addition, we could also be exposed to data breach risk if there is unauthorized access to one of our or our subcontractors\u2019 facilities or servers, or from lost or stolen laptops or other portable media, current or former employee theft of data containing PHI, misdirected mailings containing PHI, or other forms of administrative or operational error. HHS is currently conducting audits to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates and is authorized to establish a permanent program for future audits. An audit of us or our business associate subcontractors resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nNoncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information, whether by us or by one of our third party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business, including, among other consequences, mandatory disclosure to the media, public and regulators, loss of existing or new customers, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines, penalties and litigation awards, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Further, if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market, our compliance with such laws may put us at a competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis competitors who do not comply with such requirements.\nWe have clients throughout all 50 states and our solutions may contain healthcare information of patients located across all 50 states. Therefore, we may be subject to state privacy laws, which vary from state to state and, in some cases, can impose more restrictive requirements than federal law. Where state laws are more protective, we have to comply with the stricter provisions. In addition to fines and penalties imposed upon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California\u2019s patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our clients and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as PHI or PII, along with increased customer demands for enhanced data security infrastructure, could greatly increase our cost of providing our services, decrease demand for our services, reduce our revenue and/or subject us to additional liabilities.\nThe following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u00b7\namendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations that restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to clients;\n\u00b7\nchanges in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions;\n\u00b7\nfailure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and\n\u00b7\nfailure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner.\nChanges in the United States healthcare environment, or in laws relating to healthcare programs and policies, and steps we take in anticipation of such changes, particularly as they relate to the Affordable Care Act and Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe healthcare industry in the United States is subject to a multitude of changing political, economic and regulatory influences that affect every aspect of our healthcare system. The Affordable Care Act made major changes in how healthcare is delivered and reimbursed, and generally increased access to health insurance benefits to the uninsured and underinsured population of the United States. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act increased the number of individuals with Medicaid and private insurance coverage, implemented reimbursement policies that tie payment to quality, facilitated the creation of accountable care organizations that may use capitation and other alternative payment methodologies, strengthened enforcement of fraud and abuse laws and encouraged the use of information technology. However, many of these changes require implementing regulations which have not yet been drafted or have been released only as proposed rules. Moreover, it is possible that the Affordable Care Act will be repealed or restructured, or that implementation will be suspended under the current administration. Until the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented or there is more certainty concerning the future of the Affordable Care Act, it will be difficult to predict its full impact and influence on the healthcare industry. In addition, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives to contain healthcare costs, reduce federal and state government spending on healthcare products and services and limit or restrict the scope of the Medicare RAC program and other program integrity initiatives.\nWe have made and intend to continue to make investments in personnel, infrastructure and product development, as well as in the overall expansion of the services that we offer to support existing and new clients as they implement the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. However, future changes to the Affordable Care Act and to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal or state healthcare reform measures may lower reimbursement rates, establish new payment models, increase or decrease government involvement in healthcare, decrease the Medicare RAC program and otherwise change the operating environment for us and our clients. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to, or possibly repeal or restructure of the Affordable Care Act in the future. On\nJanuary 12, 2017, Congress voted in favor of a budget resolution to produce legislation that, if passed, would repeal certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Congress is also considering subsequent legislation to replace or repeal elements of or all of the Affordable Care Act. In addition, there have been recent public announcements by members of Congress and the new presidential administration regarding potential plans to repeal and replace all or a portion of the Affordable Care Act. If efforts to waive, modify, restructure or otherwise change or repeal the Affordable Care Act, in whole or in part, are successful, if we are unable to adapt our solutions to meet changing requirements or expand service delivery into new areas, or the demand for our solutions is reduced as a result of healthcare organizations\u2019 reactions to changed circumstances and financial pressures, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealthcare organizations may react to such changed circumstances and financial pressures, including those surrounding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, by taking actions such as curtailing or deferring their retention of service providers like us, which could reduce the demand for our solutions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue comes from a limited number of clients, and the loss of one or more of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of large clients. Our first-, second- and third-largest clients accounted for approximately 15%, 11% and 8% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, our ten largest clients, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 59% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. The engagement between these clients and us generally is covered through a master services agreement with multiple separate statements of work, each with different and/or staggered terms, generally ranging from one to three years. In addition, we also rely on our reputation and recommendations from key clients to promote our solutions to potential new clients. Accordingly, if any of these clients fail to renew or terminate their existing contracts or their statements of work with us, or cease to provide us with statements of work under existing master services agreements, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidation among healthcare payers or retailers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe healthcare and retail industries have recently undergone significant consolidation and further consolidation could occur in the future. When companies consolidate, services provided by more than one provider may be consolidated and purchased from a single provider or they may renegotiate or not renew their existing contractual arrangements, which could lead to the loss of a client. Overlapping services that were previously purchased separately typically are purchased only once by the combined entity, resulting in loss of revenue for the service provider. If our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients, they may discontinue their use of our services or renegotiate the terms of our agreements. In addition, if an existing client of ours merges with or is acquired by a company that does not use payment accuracy solutions, we could lose our existing client, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe healthcare payment accuracy market is relatively new and unpenetrated, and if it does not develop or if it develops more slowly than we expect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe healthcare payment accuracy market is relatively new and the overall market opportunity remains relatively unpenetrated. It is uncertain whether the healthcare payment accuracy market will achieve and sustain high levels of demand, client acceptance and market adoption. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of our clients to use, and to increase the frequency and extent of their utilization of, our solutions, as well as on our ability to demonstrate the value of payment accuracy solutions to healthcare payers and government agencies. If our clients do not perceive the benefits of our solutions, then our market may not continue to develop, or it may develop more slowly than we expect. If any of these events occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative publicity concerning the healthcare payment accuracy industry or patient confidentiality and privacy could limit the future growth of the healthcare payment accuracy market.\nOur payment accuracy solutions help prevent and recover improper payments made to healthcare providers. As a result, healthcare providers and others have criticized the healthcare payment accuracy industry and have hired lobbyists to discredit the reported success that payment accuracy solutions have had in improving the accuracy of payments. Further, negative publicity regarding patient confidentiality and privacy could limit market acceptance of our healthcare solutions. Many consumer advocates, privacy advocates and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy. They have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information. As a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. If healthcare providers, privacy advocates and others are successful in creating negative publicity for the healthcare payment accuracy industry, government and private healthcare payers could hesitate to contract with payment accuracy providers, such as us, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition for our solutions and we expect competition to increase.\nCompetition among providers of healthcare payment accuracy solutions to U.S. healthcare insurance companies is strong and we may encounter additional competition as new competitors enter this area.\nOur current healthcare solutions competitors include:\n\u00b7\nother payment accuracy vendors, including vendors focused on discrete aspects of the healthcare payment accuracy process;\n\u00b7\nfraud, waste and abuse claim edit and predictive analysis companies;\n\u00b7\nprimary claims processors;\n\u00b7\nnumerous regional utilization management companies;\n\u00b7\nin-house payment accuracy capabilities;\n\u00b7\nMedicare RACs; and\n\u00b7\nhealthcare consulting firms and other third party liability service providers.\nIn addition, our competition for retail solutions consists of one main competitor, PRGX Global, Inc. and a number of smaller companies that do not have a material market share of the retail payment accuracy market.\nMany of the payment accuracy solutions we provide may potentially be provided by competitors, and their success in attracting business or winning contract bids could adversely affect our business. In certain cases, our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater resources and market recognition than we have and may be in a position to bundle services that compete with our product and services offerings, or may be able to devote greater resources to the sale of their services and to developing and implementing new and improved systems and solutions for the clients that we serve.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors. In addition, we may be forced to lower our pricing or the demand for our solutions may decrease as a result of increased competition. Further, a failure to be responsive to our existing and potential clients\u2019 needs could hinder our ability to maintain or expand our client base, hire and retain new employees, pursue new business opportunities, complete future acquisitions and operate our business effectively. Any inability to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how, the value of our solutions may be diminished, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how that are not subject to patent or copyright protection. We seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, subcontractors or other parties, as well as through other security measures. These agreements and security measures may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property or other proprietary information or deter its misappropriation. Misappropriation of our intellectual property or other proprietary information by third parties, or any disclosure or dissemination of our business intelligence, queries, algorithms and other proprietary information by any means, could undermine competitive advantages we currently derive or may derive therefrom. Any of these situations could result in our expending significant time and incurring expense to enforce our intellectual property rights. Although we have taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, others may compete with our business by offering solutions or services that are substantially similar to ours. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or misappropriation by third parties or our employees, the value of our solutions, brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively offer solutions that have the same or similar functionality as our solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary software, confidential information and know-how, technology and other intellectual property and intellectual property rights. To do so, we rely generally on copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and third parties, and license and other agreements with consultants, vendors and clients. There can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, vendors and clients have executed such agreements or have not breached or will not breach their agreements with us, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. Additionally, we monitor our use of open source software to avoid uses that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or violate applicable open source licenses, but if we engaged in such uses inadvertently, we could be required to take remedial action or release certain of our proprietary source code. These scenarios could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, despite the protections we place on our intellectual property, a third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology, or develop similar technology. In addition, agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and might not be enforceable in certain cases.\nPursuant to our initial strategy regarding intellectual property protection, we currently hold one patent that does not apply to our current solutions. As we begin to pursue additional patents, we might not be able to obtain meaningful patent protection for our technology. In addition, if any additional patents are issued to us in the future, they might not provide us with any competitive advantages or might be successfully challenged by third parties.\nWe rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. Further, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the differentiation of our services and harm our business, reduce the value of our investment in development or business acquisitions or result in third parties making claims against us related to losses of their confidential or proprietary information.\nWe rely on our trademarks, service marks, trade names and brand names to distinguish our services from the services of our competitors and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks were successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our services, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks\nor that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks. Additionally, if we expand our focus to the international payment accuracy market, there is no guarantee that our trademarks, service marks, trade names and brand names will be adequately protected.\nOur ability to obtain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to uncertainty as to the scope of protection, registerability, patentability, validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights in each applicable jurisdiction, as well as the risk of general litigation or third party oppositions.\nExisting U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection. Moreover, if we expand our business into markets outside of the United States, our intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection as they would in the United States because of the differences in foreign trademark and other laws concerning proprietary rights. Governments may adopt regulations, and government agencies or courts may render decisions, requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights. When we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights we may be subject to claims that the intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our solutions, impair the functionality of our solutions, delay introductions of new solutions, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our solutions, or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and our contracts with our clients are subject to governmental audit and investigation. Any violation of the laws and regulations applicable to us or a negative audit or investigation finding could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMuch of our business is regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate. The laws and regulations governing our operations generally are intended to benefit and protect individual citizens, including government program beneficiaries, health plan members and healthcare providers, rather than stockholders. The government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude to enforce them. These laws and regulations, along with the terms of our government contracts, regulate how we do business, what services we offer and how we interact with our clients, providers, other healthcare payers and the public. We are subject, on an ongoing basis, to various governmental reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with our contracts and with applicable laws and regulations. Increased involvement by us in analytic or audit work that can have an impact on the eligibility of individuals for medical coverage or specific benefits could increase the likelihood and incidence of our being subjected to scrutiny or legal actions by parties other than our clients, based on alleged mistakes or deficiencies in our work, with significant resulting costs and strain on our resources.\nIn addition, because we receive payments from federal and state governmental agencies, we are subject to various laws, including the Federal False Claims Act and similar state statutes, which permit government law enforcement agencies to institute suits against us for violations and, in some cases, to seek double or treble damages, penalties and assessments. In addition, private citizens, acting as whistleblowers, can sue on behalf of the government under the \u201cqui tam\u201d provisions of the Federal False Claims Act and similar statutory provisions in many states.\nThe expansion of our operations into new products and services may further expose us to requirements and potential liabilities under additional statutes and legislative schemes that previously have not been relevant to our business, such as banking statutes, that may both increase demands on our resources for compliance activities and subject us to potential penalties for noncompliance with statutory and regulatory standards.\nIf the government discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions and debarment from doing business with the government. Such risks, particularly under the Federal False Claims Act and similar state fraud statutes, have increased in recent years due to legislative changes that have (among other impacts) expanded the definition of a false claim to include, potentially, any unreimbursed overpayment received from, or other monetary debt owed to, a government\nagency. If we are found to be in violation of any applicable law or regulation, or if we receive an adverse review, audit or investigation, any resulting negative publicity, penalties or sanctions could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry, cause clients to terminate their contracts with us or impair our ability to compete for new contracts and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal or state governments may limit or prohibit the outsourcing of certain services or functions, or may refuse to grant consents and/or waivers necessary to permit private entities, such as us, to perform certain elements of government programs or functions, such as healthcare claim auditing, or there may be state or federal limitations placed on the ability of the government to award contracts to private companies that use non-U.S. personnel, such as us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal or state governments could limit or prohibit private contractors like us from operating or performing elements of certain government functions or programs. State or local governments could be required to operate such programs with government employees as a condition of receiving federal funding. Moreover, under current law, in order to privatize certain functions of government programs, the federal government must grant a consent and/or waiver to the petitioning state or local agency. If the federal government does not grant a necessary consent or waiver, the state or local agency will be unable to outsource that function to a private entity. Such a situation could eliminate a contracting opportunity or reduce the value of an existing contract.\nIn addition, the federal government and a number of states have considered laws and/or issued rules and orders that would limit, restrict or wholly prohibit the use of non-U.S. labor in performance of government contracts, or impose sanctions for the use of such resources. Some of our clients have already chosen to contractually limit or restrict our ability to use non-U.S. resources. We employ personnel and occasionally engage vendors located outside of the United States, and while we endeavor to only employ non-U.S. personnel and vendors where appropriate and permissible, any such limitations or restrictions could require us to repatriate work currently being done outside the U.S. or prevent us from having additional work done outside the United States, raise our costs of doing business, expose us to unexpected fines or penalties, increase the prices we must charge to clients to realize a profit and eliminate or significantly reduce the value of existing contracts or potential contract opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on effective information processing systems that are compliant with current HIPAA transaction and code set standards and the integrity of the data in, and operations of, our information systems, as well as those of other entities that provide us with data or receive data from us.\nOur ability to conduct our operations and accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems and the integrity of the processes performed by those systems. These information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs, satisfy client requests and handle and enable our expansion and growth. Despite our testing and quality control measures, we cannot be certain that errors or system deficiencies will not be found and that any necessary remediation can be done in a timeframe that is acceptable to our clients or that client relationships will not be impaired by the occurrence of errors or the need for remediation. In addition, implementation of upgrades and enhancements may cost more, take longer or require more testing than originally expected. Given the large amount of data we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures, errors or technical deficiencies in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect, utilize or disseminate to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our clients regard as significant.\nMoreover, because many of the services we furnish to clients involve submitting high volumes of monetary claims to third parties and processing payments from them, the efficiency and effectiveness of our own operations are to some degree dependent on the claims processing systems of these third parties and their compliance with any new transaction and code set standards. Since October 1, 2015, health plans, commercial payers and healthcare providers have been required to transition to the new ICD-10 coding system, which greatly expands the number and detail of diagnosis codes used for inpatient, outpatient and physician claims. The transition to the new transaction and code set standard entailed time and expense, and it is possible that it could initially result in disruptions or delays as we and other affected parties, including clients make necessary system adjustments to be fully compliant and capable of exchanging data.\nIn addition, we may experience delays in processing claims and therefore earning our fees if the third parties with whom we work are not in full compliance with these new standards in the required timeframe. Claims processing systems failures, incapacities or deficiencies internal to these third parties could significantly delay or obstruct our ability to recover money for our clients, and thereby interfere with our performance under our contracts and our ability to generate revenue from those contracts in the timeframe we anticipate, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur services could become subject to new, revised or enhanced regulatory requirements in the future, which could result in increased costs, could delay or prevent our introduction of new solutions or could impair the function or value of our existing solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated on the federal, state and local levels, and is subject to changing legislative, regulatory, political and other influences. Changes to existing laws and regulations, or the enactment of new federal and state laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry, could create unexpected liabilities for us, could cause us or our clients to incur additional costs and could restrict our or our clients\u2019 operations. Many healthcare laws are complex, subject to frequent change and dependent on interpretation and enforcement decisions from government agencies with broad discretion. The application of these laws to us or our clients, or to the specific services and relationships we have with our clients, is not always clear. In addition, federal and state legislatures periodically have considered or passed programs to reform or amend the U.S. healthcare system at both the federal and state level, such as the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. Our failure to anticipate accurately the application of these laws and similar or future laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with them, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur services may become subject to new or enhanced regulatory requirements and we may be required to change or adapt our services in order to comply with these regulations. For example, the introduction of the ICD-10 coding framework in 2015 presented challenges for our business, including requiring us to allocate resources to training and upgrading our systems. If we fail to successfully implement the ICD-10 coding framework or other new regulatory requirements, it could adversely affect our ability to offer services deemed critical by our clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. New or enhanced regulatory requirements may render our solutions obsolete or prevent us from performing certain services. Further, new or enhanced regulatory requirements could impose additional costs on us, thereby making existing solutions unprofitable, and could make the introduction of new solutions more costly or time consuming than we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be precluded from bidding on and/or performing certain work due to other work that we perform, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious laws, regulations and administrative policies prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies in capacities that might be viewed as creating an actual or perceived conflict of interest. In particular, CMS has stringent conflict of interest rules, which limit our bidding for work that might conflict, or be perceived by CMS to conflict, with contractual work for CMS. State governments and managed care organizations also have conflict of interest restrictions that could limit our ability to bid for certain work. Conflict of interest rules and standards change frequently and are subject to varying interpretations and varying degrees and consistency of enforcement at the federal, state and municipal levels, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in navigating these restrictions.\nThe expansion and diversification of our business operations increases the possibility that clients or potential clients will perceive conflicts of interest between our various subsidiaries, products, services, activities and client relationships. Such conflicts, whether real or perceived, could result in loss of contracts or require us to divest ourselves of certain existing business in order to qualify for new contract awards. We may be required to adjust our current management and personnel structure, as well as our corporate organization and entity structure, in order to appropriately mitigate conflicts and otherwise accommodate our needs as a company that is expanding in size and complexity. Our failure to devote sufficient care, attention and resources to managing these adjustments may result in technical or administrative errors that could expose us to potential liability or adverse regulatory action. If we are prevented from expanding our business due to real or perceived conflicts of interest, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe obtain a portion of our business through submitting responses to requests for proposals (\u201cRFPs\u201d). Future contracts may not be awarded through this process on the same level and we may not re-procure certain contracts.\nIn order to market our solutions to clients, we sometimes are required to respond to RFPs to compete for a contract. This requires that we accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract, the time required to establish operations and the likely terms of any proposals submitted by our competitors. We also must assemble and submit a large volume of information within a RFP\u2019s rigid timetable. Our ability to provide timely and complete responses to RFPs will greatly impact our business. Should any part of our business suffer a negative event, for example, a client dispute or a government inquiry, we may be required to disclose the occurrence of that event in a RFP, which could impact our ability to win the contract at issue. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to obtain contracts in response to RFPs, that we will be successful in reentering into contracts after they expire or that our proposals will result in profitable contracts. In addition, if we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be precluded from entering certain markets for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards or renew expiring contracts over any extended period, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to accurately estimate the factors upon which we base our contract pricing, we may generate less profit than expected or incur losses on those contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur client contracts are generally performance fee-based. We receive a fee for such contracts based on the payment inaccuracies that we prevent for our prospective solutions clients, or the recoveries received by our retrospective solutions and retail clients. Our ability to earn a profit on a performance fee contract requires that we accurately estimate the costs involved and outcomes likely to be achieved and assess the probability of completing multiple tasks and transactions within the contracted time period.\nWe derive a relatively small portion of our revenue on a \u201cfee-for-service\u201d basis whereby billing is based upon a flat fee or a fee per hour. To earn a profit on these contracts, we must accurately estimate costs involved and assess the probability of achieving certain milestones within the contracted time period. If we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects, or if we encounter increased or unexpected costs, delays, failures, liabilities or risks, including those outside of our control, our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated. Although we believe that we have recorded adequate provisions in our financial statements for losses on our fee-for-service contracts where applicable, as required under GAAP, we cannot provide assurance that our contract provisions will be adequate to cover all actual future losses. The inability to accurately estimate the factors upon which we base our contract pricing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, some of our client contracts guarantee that we will achieve certain performance levels. If we are unsuccessful in reaching these performance levels, we may have to provide the client with service credits or reduce our fees, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to execute on our business plans will be negatively impacted if we fail to properly manage our growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, our size and the scope of our business operations have expanded rapidly, particularly as a result of the Connolly iHealth Merger, and we expect that we will continue to grow and expand into new areas within the healthcare industry; however, such growth and expansion carries costs and risks that, if not properly managed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To effectively manage our business plans, we must continue to improve our operations, while remaining competitive. We must also be flexible and responsive to our clients\u2019 needs and to changes in the political, economic and regulatory environment in which we operate. The greater size and complexity of our expanding business puts additional strain on our administrative, operational and financial resources and makes the determination of optimal resource allocation more difficult. A failure to anticipate or properly address the demands that our growth and diversification may have on our resources and existing infrastructure may result in unanticipated costs and inefficiencies and could negatively impact our ability to execute on our business plans and growth goals, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to successfully complete the integration of the Connolly and iHealth Technologies businesses and realize any synergies that we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Connolly iHealth Merger and the success of our combined companies will depend in part upon whether we can complete the integration of the predecessor businesses in an effective and efficient manner. Our ability to integrate the predecessor businesses and realize the long-term synergies that we anticipate is subject to a number of uncertainties, many of which are related to conditions beyond our control, such as general economic trends, changes to regulations and competition. We may also encounter ongoing difficulties in effectively implementing our combined business plan and in implementing operational, accounting and technology policies, processes and systems for the combined business, in integrating the cultures of each of the predecessor businesses, in cross-selling our solutions to the existing clients of the predecessor businesses and in the impairment of acquired intangible assets, including goodwill. An inability to effectively deal with any of those difficulties in a timely and effective manner may result in our failing to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the Connolly iHealth Merger, including anticipated synergies, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the time and energy management has spent and will continue to spend in integrating Connolly and iHealth Technologies may divert the attention of management away from the core operations of the business.\nIf we do not successfully integrate future acquisitions or strategic partnerships that we may enter into, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions or partnerships, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect to pursue future acquisitions in order to expand and diversify our business. We may also form strategic partnerships with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. We cannot, however, provide assurance that we will be able to identify any potential acquisition or strategic partnership candidates, consummate any additional acquisitions or enter into any strategic partnerships or that any future acquisitions or strategic partnerships will be successfully integrated or will be advantageous to us. Entities we acquire may not achieve the revenue and earnings we anticipate or their liabilities may exceed our expectations. We could face integration issues pertaining to the internal controls and operational functions of the acquired companies and we also could fail to realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates. Client dissatisfaction or performance problems with a particular acquired entity or resulting from a strategic partnership could have a material adverse effect on our reputation as a whole. We may be unable to profitably manage any acquired entities, or we may fail to integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses, delays or other problems. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits from any strategic partnerships we form.\nIf we fail to successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire or strategic partnerships that we enter into, we may not realize any of the benefits we anticipate in connection with the acquisitions or partnerships, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain or upgrade our operational platforms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe expect to make substantial investments in and changes to our operational platforms, systems and applications to compete effectively and keep up with technological advances. We may face difficulties in integrating any upgraded platforms into our current technology infrastructure. In addition, significant technological changes could render our existing solutions obsolete. Although we have invested, and will continue to invest, significant resources in developing and enhancing our solutions and platforms, any failure to keep up with technological advances or to integrate upgraded operational platforms and solutions into our existing technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the terms of our Medicare RAC program contracts are substantially changed or if Medicare seeks significant refunds under our original Medicare RAC program contract.\nHistorically, CMS has been a significant client. Net revenue under our Medicare RAC contract was $14.0 million, $18.5 million and $44.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn February 2013, CMS began the reprocurement process for its Medicare RAC program contracts and issued a Request for Quote (\u201cRFQ\u201d). After a protest was filed by potential bidders on the terms of this initial RFQ, CMS issued a group of five new RFQs for the Medicare RAC program. The terms of these new RFQs were also protested by potential bidders, causing CMS to withdraw the new RFQs and resulting in further delays in the reprocurement process. In response to these delays, CMS allowed the current Medicare RAC contractors, including us, to continue active recovery auditing through July 29, 2016. Since this date, our activities under our Medicare RAC program contract have been limited to administrative matters, including collections, related to findings through July 29, 2016. Our existing Medicare RAC program contract, including any liability for appeals, ends on January 31, 2018.\nIn October 2016, CMS announced that we were awarded two Medicare RAC program contracts to provide retrospective payment accuracy services for Medicare Parts A and B (other than durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies claims and home health and hospice claims). Pursuant to these awards, we are the Medicare RAC for Region 2 (Central U.S.) and Region 3 (Southeast U.S.). The new Medicare RAC program contracts have a one year initial term, with multiple one-year renewal options at the election of CMS. We do not yet know all of the terms of the new Medicare RAC program contracts but CMS has indicated that we may be able to request medical charts in the second quarter of 2017.\nUnder Medicare RAC program contracts, we are permitted to review only a small subset of CMS\u2019s claims for potential payment inaccuracies. CMS exercises its discretion with respect to the number of claims and types of concepts that Medicare RAC contractors may audit. CMS has suspended the review of certain types of claims, and, effective October 1, 2015, shifted the responsibility for initial medical reviews for certain claims, many of which were profitable to us, to Quality Improvement Organizations. There can be no assurance that CMS will lift its suspension of such reviews and CMS may determine to restrict the types of claims its payment accuracy providers review even further. The continued suspensions of these reviews by the Medicare RACs, changes to the review strategies and any other changes to the Medicare RAC program could have a material impact on our future revenue.\nOn August 29, 2014, CMS announced that it would settle with hospitals willing to withdraw inpatient status claims currently pending in the Medicare RAC appeals process by offering to pay hospitals 68% for all eligible claims that they have billed to Medicare. On July 1, 2015, CMS issued a Technical Direction Letter to us and the other Medicare RACs indicating that we will only be entitled to the contract contingency fee on the settled amounts of the claims, or 32% of the original inpatient claim amounts. Based on the initial lists of finalized settlements provided by CMS, we would be required to refund CMS approximately $22.3 million in Medicare RAC contingency fees due to these adjustments, which is in excess of the amount we have accrued for these settlements. CMS further advised that as the hospital settlement project continues, additional settlement lists will be matched to Medicare RAC claims which may result in updated refund amounts to those initially provided. While there are uncertainties in any dispute resolution and results are uncertain, we have disputed CMS\u2019s findings based on our interpretation of the terms of the Medicare RAC contract and our belief that the backup data provided by CMS is inaccurate and/or incomplete. In addition, on September 28, 2016, CMS announced a second settlement process to allow eligible providers to settle their inpatient status claims currently under appeal beginning December 1, 2016. This second settlement process could result in additional amounts owed to CMS. The amount of any such additional claims cannot presently be determined. Although we accrue an estimated liability for appeals based on the amount of fees that are subject to appeals, closures or other adjustments, which we estimate are probable of being returned to providers following a successful appeal, and we similarly accrue an allowance against accounts receivables related to fees yet to be collected, the impact of CMS\u2019 settlement offer to hospitals remains uncertain. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we are required to return certain fees we have already been paid under our existing Medicare RAC contract, any final determination of amounts owed by us to CMS under the current Medicare RAC contract materially exceeds our estimated liability for appeals, or we are unable to collect fees for audits we have already performed. There could be a material adverse impact on our revenue, results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to obtain full payments for properly provided services, are required to repay a portion of prior fees associated with the hospital settlement program or if future fees payable to us by CMS are reduced.\nAlthough we do not anticipate our Medicare RAC contract will represent a significant portion of our business going forward, our Medicare RAC contract with CMS still represents a future business opportunity for us. If our new Medicare RAC program contracts contain substantially different terms from our original contract, if the implementation of the new contracts is significantly delayed, if CMS fails to renew the new contracts at the end of any term, if CMS seeks significant refunds from us in connection with its settlement process, or if CMS imposes or implements other changes to the Medicare RAC program that materially reduce our revenue or profitability associated with the Medicare\nRAC program, any such change, action or delay could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. government\u2019s determination to award us a Medicare RAC contract may be challenged by an interested party. As a result, the Medicare RAC contract may be delayed or may never be implemented if such a challenge is successful, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe laws and regulations governing the procurement of goods and services by the U.S. government provide procedures by which other bidders and other interested parties may challenge the award of a government contract. If any such protests are filed, the government agency may decide to withhold a contract award or suspend performance under the contract while the protest is being considered, potentially delaying the start of the contract. If we are the original awardee of a protested contract, we could be forced to expend considerable funds to defend a potential award, while also incurring expenses to maintain our ability to timely start implementation in case the protest is resolved in our favor. In addition, a contract award may be terminated or the government agency may opt to solicit new bids and award a new contract if a protest is successful or the government agency chooses not to uphold its original award. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail if a contract we have been awarded is protested. Extended implementation delays or successful challenges of our contract awards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to expand our retail business or reduce costs of implementing our retail solutions, revenue and profitability for our retail business could remain flat or decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe domestic retail payment accuracy market is a highly developed market with limited potential for growth. We have payment accuracy solution contracts with eight of the ten largest U.S. retailers and longer than ten year relationships with many of our top retail clients, which represents a significant share of the retail payment accuracy market and, therefore, the opportunity to grow our share of the existing domestic retail market is limited. In addition, some of our clients have an internal staff that reviews the transactions before we do. As the skills, experience and resources of our retail clients\u2019 internal recovery staff improve, they will identify many overpayments themselves and reduce some of our opportunities to identify payment inaccuracies and generate related revenue. If we are not able to reduce the costs of implementing our payment accuracy solutions, our domestic retail business revenue may remain flat or decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur client contracts generally contain provisions under which the client may terminate the use of our solutions prior to the completion of the agreement.\nMany of our client contracts provide that the client may terminate the contract without cause prior to the end of the term of the agreement by providing us with relatively short prior written notice of the termination. As a result, the existence of contractual relationships with our clients is not an assurance that we will continue to provide our solutions to any of our clients through the entire term of their respective agreements. If clients representing a significant portion of our revenue terminated their agreements unexpectedly, we may not, in the short-term, be able to replace the revenue and income from such contracts and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, client contract terminations also could harm our reputation within the industry which could negatively impact our ability to obtain new clients.\nOur recent rebranding may not be successful.\nBeginning September 24, 2015, we launched a significant rebranding initiative to change our brand and corporate name to Cotiviti. There is no assurance that our rebranding initiative will be successful or result in a positive return on investment. In addition, while the Connolly and iHealth Technologies brand names had established themselves as premium brands in the payment accuracy market, we have virtually no operating history under the Cotiviti brand. We could be required to devote significant additional resources to advertising and marketing in order to increase the awareness of the Cotiviti brand. If we are unable to establish Cotiviti as a premium brand name in the payment accuracy market, or if we expend significant resources in an effort to do so, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be a party to litigation, regulatory actions or other dispute resolution proceedings. Adverse judgments or settlements in any of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject and may be a party to lawsuits and other claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. These may include lawsuits and claims related to, for example, contracts, subcontracts, protection of confidential information or trade secrets, wage and benefits, employment of our workforce or compliance with any of a wide array of state and federal statutes, rules and regulations that pertain to different aspects of our business. We also may be required to initiate expensive litigation or other proceedings to protect our business interests. In addition, because of the payments we receive from government clients, we may be subject to unexpected inquiries, investigations, legal actions or enforcement proceedings pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act, healthcare fraud, waste and abuse laws or similar legislation. Any investigations, settlements or adverse judgments stemming from such legal disputes or other claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us, as well as reputational injury that could adversely affect us. In addition, litigation and other legal claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of currently pending legal matters may change in the future. Those uncertainties include, but are not limited to, costs of litigation, unpredictable judicial or jury decisions and the differing laws and judicial proclivities regarding damage awards among the states in which we operate. Unexpected outcomes in such legal proceedings, or changes in management\u2019s evaluation or predictions of the likely outcomes of such proceedings (possibly resulting in changes in established reserves), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on many different entities to supply information. If we are unable to successfully manage our relationships with any of these suppliers, it may harm the quality and availability of our solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe obtain data used in our solutions from many sources, including commercial insurance plans, financial institutions, managed care organizations, government entities and non-government entities. From time to time, challenges arise in managing and maintaining our relationships with entities that are not our clients and that furnish information to us pursuant to a combination of voluntary cooperation and legal obligation under laws and regulations that are often subject to differing interpretation. Our data suppliers may determine that some uses of data for our clients are not permitted by our agreements and seek to limit or end our access and use of certain data for particular purposes or clients. They may also make errors in compiling, transmitting or accurately characterizing data, or may have technological limitations that interfere with our receipt or use of the data we are relying upon them to provide. If a number of information sources or suppliers become unable or unwilling to provide us with certain data under terms of use that are acceptable to us and our clients, or if the applicable regulatory and law enforcement regime for use and protection of this data changes in a way that imposes unacceptable or unreasonable conditions or risks on us or disincentivizes our suppliers to continue to provide us with data, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain new agreements with alternative data suppliers on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we lose our data sources or access to certain data; are unable to identify and reach the requisite agreements with suitable alternative suppliers and integrate these data sources into our service offerings; or there is a lack of integrity of data that our suppliers provide, we could experience service disruptions, increased costs, reduced quality of our solutions and/or performance penalties under our client contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use software vendors, utility providers and network providers in our business and if they cannot deliver or perform as expected or if our relationships with them are terminated or otherwise change it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to service our clients and deliver and implement solutions requires that we work with certain third party providers, including software vendors, utility providers and network providers, and depends on such third parties meeting our expectations in both timeliness and quality. We might incur significant additional liabilities if the services provided by these third parties do not meet our expectations, if they terminate or refuse to renew their relationships with us or if they were to offer their services to us on less advantageous terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, while there are backup systems in many of our operating facilities, an extended outage of utility or network services supplied by these vendors or providers could impair our ability to deliver our solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling certain solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to claims that we are misappropriating or infringing intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others. These claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive to defend and divert management\u2019s attention from our operations. If we become liable to third parties for infringing these rights, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and develop non-infringing technology, cease using the solutions or providing the services that use or contain the infringing intellectual property or obtain a license. We may be unable to develop non-infringing solutions or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may also be required to indemnify our clients if they become subject to third party claims relating to intellectual property that we license or otherwise provide to them, which could be costly. If we are subject to claims of misappropriating or infringing the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. As a result, you will not be able to rely on our results of operations in any particular period as an indication of our future performance.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate and may fail to match our past or projected performance. Because we generally provide solutions under contracts that contain performance fee arrangements and generally recognize revenue only when our clients have received the economic value of the payment inaccuracies discovered using our solutions, we have experienced significant variations in our revenue between reporting periods due to the timing and delays in resolving these inaccuracies. We also occasionally face challenges in obtaining full payments for our properly provided solutions from clients and parties to whom we provide solutions, despite our right to prompt and full payment under the terms of our contracts.\nOur revenue and results of operations also have been impacted from period to period as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nnumber of payments reviewed and changes in scope of payments reviewed;\n\u00b7\namount of inaccurate payments identified using our solutions and the amount of related recoveries;\n\u00b7\nthe success of our cross-selling efforts;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in sales activity given our lengthy sales cycle;\n\u00b7\nthe commencement, completion or termination of contracts during any particular period;\n\u00b7\nexpenses related to contracts that are incurred in periods prior to revenue being recognized;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of government contract awards;\n\u00b7\nthe time required to resolve bid protests related to government contract awards;\n\u00b7\ncontract renewal discussions, which may result in delayed payments for previously provided services;\n\u00b7\nthe intermittent timing of periodic revenue recovery projects, particularly for our retail clients;\n\u00b7\nnon-recurring retail recovery projects;\n\u00b7\ntechnological and operational issues affecting our clients, including delays in payment receipt for previously recognized revenue due to delays in certain clients processing our findings through their systems;\n\u00b7\nadjustments to age/quality of receivables and accruals as a result of delays involving contract limitations and changes, subcontractor performance deficiencies or internal managerial decisions not to pursue identified claim revenue from clients;\n\u00b7\nseasonality in our business; and\n\u00b7\nregulatory changes or general economic conditions as they affect healthcare providers and payers and retailers.\nIn addition, as we seek to expand the scope of solutions used by our existing clients, cross-sell our solutions to existing clients and introduce enhancements to our existing solutions or new solutions, we may not be able to accurately estimate the timing for implementing and completing contracts, making it difficult to reliably forecast revenue under those contracts. We cannot predict the extent to which future revenue variations could occur due to these or other factors. Consequently, our results of operations are subject to significant fluctuation and our results of operations for any particular quarter or fiscal year may not be indicative of results of operations for future periods.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates.\nWe have operations in many states within the United States as well as in Canada, the United Kingdom and India. Accordingly, we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future financial condition and results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned and taxed, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including impairments of goodwill, by changes in GAAP or other applicable accounting standards or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, we are subject to periodic examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and international tax authorities. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree with and subsequently challenge the amount of profits taxed in their state or country, which may result in increased tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties, which would cause our tax expense to increase. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we may expand the sales of our solutions to retail clients located outside of the United States, our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nWe maintain operations outside of the United States which we may expand in the future. Conducting and expanding international operations subjects us to new risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These include:\n\u00b7\nexposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in collecting payments internationally and managing and staffing international operations;\n\u00b7\nestablishing relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in international locations;\n\u00b7\nincreased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with international locations;\n\u00b7\nburdens of complying with a wide variety of laws associated with international operations, including data privacy and security, taxes and customs and intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nsignificant fines, penalties and collateral consequences if we fail to comply with anti-bribery laws;\n\u00b7\nheightened risk of improper, unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies;\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u00b7\npolitical, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and\n\u00b7\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nThe occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international operations and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have operations and customer relationships outside of the United States and we could be materially adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nThe FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. As we expand our international presence, we may operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may be at variance with local customs and practices. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws and we have training and compliance programs related to such laws, such policies, programs and our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, subcontractors or agents. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to realize the entire book value of goodwill and other intangible assets from the Connolly iHealth Merger or from other acquisitions.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have $1,196.0 million of goodwill and $533.3 million of net intangible assets, primarily related to the Connolly iHealth Merger and from other acquisitions. We assess goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually and more frequently if certain events or circumstances warrant. In the event that the book value of goodwill or other intangible assets is impaired, any such impairment would be charged to earnings in the period of impairment. In the event that we determine that goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel.\nOur success and future growth is dependent upon the ability of our executive officers, senior managers and other key personnel to operate and manage our business and execute on our growth strategies successfully. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to retain our executive officers, senior managers or other key personnel or attract additional key personnel. We may incur increased expenses in connection with the hiring, promotion, retention or replacement of any of these individuals. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur ability to operate our business and provide our solutions is dependent on our ability to recruit, employ, train and retain the skilled personnel who have relevant experience in the healthcare and retail industries as well as information technology professionals who can design, implement, operate and maintain complex information technology systems. For example, certain of our employees in our healthcare division must either have or rapidly develop a significant amount of technical knowledge with regard to medical insurance coding and procedures. In addition, certain of our retrospective claims accuracy solutions rely on a team of trained registered nurses or medical coding professionals to review medical information and provide feedback with respect to the medical appropriateness of care provided. Innovative, experienced and technologically proficient professionals, qualified nurses and experienced medical coding professionals are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource. Our ability to recruit and retain such individuals depends on a number of factors, including the competitive demands for employees having, or able to rapidly develop, the specialized skills we need and the level and structure of compensation required to hire and retain such employees. We may not be able to recruit or retain the personnel necessary to efficiently operate and support our\nbusiness. Even if our recruitment and retention strategies are successful, our labor costs may increase significantly. In addition, our internal training programs may not be successful in providing inexperienced personnel with the specialized skills required to perform their duties. If we are unable to hire, train and retain sufficient personnel with the requisite skills without significantly increasing our labor costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe demand for our solutions may be impacted by factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation. For example, the United States economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years. In addition, the United Kingdom electorate voted on June 23, 2016 to exit the European Union (which has popularly been referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), resulting in market volatility that may continue during the Brexit negotiation process. Any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. The deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason also could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us.\nOur outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations.\nOn September 28, 2016, our subsidiary Cotiviti Corporation and certain other of our subsidiaries entered into the Restated Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the lenders party thereto agreed to provide the First Lien Credit Facilities consisting of the (a) First Lien Term A Loans in the original principal amount of $250.0 million, (b) the First Lien Term B Loans in the original principal amount of $550.0 million and (c) the $100.0 million Revolver, of which $25.0 million may, at our option, be made available for letters of credit and $20.0 million may, at our option, be made available for swingline loans. In connection with entering into the Restated Credit Agreement, we refinanced our previously outstanding Initial Secured Credit Facilities, comprising the Initial First Lien Credit Facilities and the Initial Second Lien Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $795.5 million outstanding principal amount under our First Lien Term Loans and availability under the Revolver of $99.5 million. Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have important consequences for us, including, without limitation, that:\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nour indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressures;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and for general corporate and other purposes may be limited;\n\u00b7\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including and most significantly our borrowings under our First Lien Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u00b7\nprevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise or successfully carrying out our plans to expand our business; and\n\u00b7\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited.\nUnder the terms of the agreements governing our First Lien Credit Facilities, we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants, which may limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it. For example, the obligations under the First Lien Credit Facilities may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default, which includes customary events of default including, without limitation, payment defaults, cross-defaults to certain material indebtedness, covenant defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, bankruptcy events, material judgments, certain ERISA-related events, material defects with respect to guarantees and collateral, invalidity of subordination provisions and change of control. If not cured, an event of default could result in any amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable, which would require us to, among other things, seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected assets and/or reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and any such financing or refinancing might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations or are forced to take additional measures to be able to service our indebtedness, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the agreements governing our First Lien Credit Facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness we can incur in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. For example, pursuant to incremental facilities under the First Lien Credit Facilities, we may incur up to (i) an aggregate amount of the greater of $230.0 million and 75.0% of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the First Lien Credit Facilities) of additional secured or unsecured debt plus (ii) an unlimited additional amount of secured debt, subject to compliance with certain leverage-based tests, as described in the agreements governing our First Lien Credit Facilities. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our First Lien Credit Facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us that may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nThe agreements governing our First Lien Credit Facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. These include covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness or other contingent obligations;\n\u00b7\ngrant liens;\n\u00b7\nenter into certain agreements with negative pledge clauses or restrictions on subsidiary distributions;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries to us;\n\u00b7\nmake payments in respect of junior liens or subordinated debt;\n\u00b7\nmake investments, acquisitions, loans and advances;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, merge, liquidate or dissolve;\n\u00b7\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u00b7\nengage in sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u00b7\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\nmaterially alter the business that we conduct;\n\u00b7\nmodify organizational documents in a manner that is materially adverse to the lenders under the agreements governing our First Lien Credit Facilities; and\n\u00b7\namend or otherwise change the terms of the documentation governing certain restricted debt.\nThe Restated Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires compliance with a secured leverage ratio test set at 5.50:1.00, with stepdowns to 5.25:1.00 and 5.00:1.00 after September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2019, respectively, as of the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters recently ended, on the last day of any fiscal quarter, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2016. Our ability to meet that financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet that ratio. We were in compliance with this covenant as of December 31, 2016, but there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with such covenant in the future.\nA breach of any covenant or restriction contained in the agreements governing our First Lien Credit Facilities could result in a default under those agreements. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the First Lien Term Loans or Revolver may elect (after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods) to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable, but in the case of a breach of the financial covenant, the holders of the First Lien Term B Loans may only exercise such rights after a majority of the lenders under the Revolver have terminated the commitments under the Revolver and accelerated the revolving loans thereunder, and the lenders holding a majority of the First Lien Term A Loans have accelerated the First Lien Term A Loans. The lenders under the First Lien Term Loans and Revolver also have the right upon an event of default thereunder to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. Further, following an event of default under the agreements governing our First Lien Credit Facilities, the lenders under the First Lien Term Loans and Revolver will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt. If the debt under the First Lien Term Loans or the Revolver was to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt or any other debt that may become due as a result of that acceleration.\nWe are dependent upon our lenders for financing to execute our business strategy and meet our liquidity needs. If our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or we are unable to borrow, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring periods of volatile credit markets, there is risk that lenders, even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices, could fail or refuse to honor their legal commitments and obligations under existing credit commitments, including but not limited to extending credit up to the maximum permitted by the Revolver. If our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their revolving credit commitments or we are unable to borrow, it could be difficult to obtain sufficient funding to execute our business strategy or meet our liquidity needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur debt may be downgraded, which could adversely affect our ability to manage our operations and respond to changes in our business.\nA decrease in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our short and long-term debt may negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVolatility and weakness in bank and capital markets may adversely affect credit availability and related financing costs for us.\nBank and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. If the disruption in these markets is prolonged, our ability to refinance, and the related cost of refinancing, some or all of our debt could be adversely affected. Although we currently can access the bank and capital markets, there is no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for us. These factors, including the tightening of credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing. Increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets\nalso could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain financing. In addition, the adoption of new statutes and regulations, the implementation of recently enacted laws or new interpretations or the enforcement of older laws and regulations applicable to the financial markets or the financial services industry could result in a reduction in the amount of available credit or an increase in the cost of credit. Disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect our lenders, insurers, customers and other counterparties. Any of these could result in a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSecurities markets worldwide have experienced in the past, and are likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our results of operations. The trading price of our common stock may become highly volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including, among other things, the risk factors described herein and other factors beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock could include:\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the broader stock market;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in the healthcare industry in general or in the healthcare payment or claims processing markets in particular;\n\u00b7\nvariations in operating results of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of new services by us, our competitors or our clients;\n\u00b7\nissuance of new, negative or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports, recommendations or estimates;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perceptions of us and the industries in which we or our clients operate;\n\u00b7\nsales, or anticipated sales, of our stock, including sales by our officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nregulatory or political developments;\n\u00b7\nthe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7\nannouncements, media reports or other public forum comments related to litigation, claims or reputational charges against us;\n\u00b7\nguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u00b7\nthe sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, including those resulting from system failures and disruptions, earthquakes, hurricanes, war, acts of terrorism, other natural disasters or responses to these events;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u00b7\nstock-based compensation expense under GAAP or other applicable accounting standards;\n\u00b7\nlitigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u00b7\nchanging economic conditions.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for shares of our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock sometimes have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. Securities litigation against us, regardless of the merits or outcome, could result in substantial costs and divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our business, profitability and reputation.\nWe are controlled by Advent, whose interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.\nWe are controlled by Advent, which beneficially owns in the aggregate 64.7% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2016. As a result of this ownership, Advent has effective control over the outcome of votes on all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our charter and bylaws, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and other significant corporate transactions, and our winding up and dissolution.\nIn addition, persons associated with Advent currently serve on our Board. The interests of Advent may not always coincide with the interests of our other stockholders and the concentration of effective control in Advent will limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. The concentration of ownership and voting power of Advent also may delay, defer or even prevent an acquisition by a third party or other change of control and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without their support, even if such events are in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nFurther, Advent may have an interest in having us pursue acquisitions, divestitures, financing or other transactions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional debt or equity and the declaration and payment of dividends, that, in its judgment, could enhance Advent\u2019s equity investments, even though such transactions may involve risk to us or to our creditors. Additionally, Advent may make investments in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us, or may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nAdvent may take actions that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause the value of your investment to decline.\nOur directors and stockholders, with certain exceptions, do not have obligations to present business opportunities to us and may compete with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our directors and stockholders do not have any obligation to offer us an opportunity to participate in business opportunities presented to them even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued (and therefore may be free to compete with us in the same business or similar businesses), and that, to the extent permitted by law, such directors and stockholders will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any duty by reason of any such activities.\nAs a result, our directors and stockholders and their respective affiliates will not be prohibited from investing in competing businesses or doing business with our clients. Therefore, we may be in competition with our directors and stockholders or their respective affiliates, and we may not have knowledge of, or be able to pursue, transactions that could potentially be beneficial to us. Accordingly, we may lose certain corporate opportunities or suffer competitive harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or prospects.\nWe have elected to take advantage of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption to the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies due to Advent\u2019s majority ownership of our outstanding common stock, we are not required to have a majority of our Board be independent under the applicable rules of the NYSE, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee comprised entirely of independent directors. As permitted by our status as a controlled company, our Board has established a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee that is not comprised solely of independent members. In addition, we may choose to change our Board composition. Accordingly, should the interests of Advent differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nAnti-takeover protections in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws or our contractual obligations may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, as well as provisions of the DGCL, could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or the replacement of our management or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of our common stock, even if it would benefit our stockholders.\nIn addition, our Board has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. The issuance of shares of preferred stock or the adoption of a stockholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.\nIn addition, under the Restated Credit Agreement, a \u201cchange of control\u201d (as defined in the Restated Credit Agreement) would cause us to be in default and the lenders would have the right to terminate the commitments to provide loans under the Revolver and accelerate all outstanding loans, and if so accelerated, we would be required to repay all of our outstanding obligations under our First Lien Credit Facilities. From time to time we may enter into other contracts that contain change of control provisions that limit the value of, or even terminate, the contract upon a change of control. These change of control provisions may discourage a takeover of our company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe have and will continue to incur increased costs and obligations as a result of being a public company.\nAs a publicly traded company, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not required to incur in the past, and will incur additional expenses after we cease to be an emerging growth company (to the extent that we take advantage of certain exceptions from reporting requirements that are available to us as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act). We are required to file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in Section 13 of the Exchange Act. We are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including the requirements of the NYSE and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose additional compliance obligations upon us. Among other things, as a public company:\n\u00b7\nwe prepare and distribute periodic public reports and other stockholder communications in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws and applicable NYSE rules;\n\u00b7\nthe roles and duties of our Board and committees of the Board are expanded;\n\u00b7\nwe comply with more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance functions;\n\u00b7\nwe manage enhanced investor relations functions; and\n\u00b7\nwe involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the activities listed above.\nThese changes require a commitment of additional resources and many of our competitors also comply with these obligations. We may not be successful in complying with these obligations in the future and the commitment of resources required for complying with them could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe changes necessitated by becoming a public company require a significant commitment of resources and management supervision that has increased and may continue to increase our costs and might place a strain on our systems and resources. As a result, our management\u2019s attention might be diverted from other business concerns. If we fail to maintain an effective internal control environment or to comply with the numerous legal and regulatory requirements imposed on public companies, we could make material errors in, and be required to restate, our financial statements. Any such restatement could result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and sanctions imposed on us by the SEC. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nOur management team historically managed a private company and the transition to managing a public company presents new challenges.\nSince our IPO in May 2016 we have been subject to various regulatory requirements, including those of the SEC and the NYSE. These requirements include record keeping, financial reporting and corporate governance rules and regulations. We have not historically had the resources typically found in a public company. Our internal infrastructure may not be adequate to support our increased reporting obligations, and we may be unable to hire, train or retain necessary staff and may be reliant on engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome our lack of experience or employees. If our internal infrastructure is inadequate, we are unable to engage outside consultants or are otherwise unable to fulfill our public company obligations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and may elect to comply with reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if we choose to comply with certain of the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2021, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue exceeds $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period, whether or not issued in a registered offering.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we file with the SEC as a public company, and generally requires in the same report a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We could be an emerging growth company until December 31, 2021. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation and the incurrence of significant additional expenditures.\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we have undertaken various actions, and may need to take additional actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. In connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation provided by our independent registered public accounting firm.\nIf we are unable to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to report our financial information accurately on a timely basis, may suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules, may breach the covenants under our credit facilities and incur additional costs. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price.\nWe do not intend in the foreseeable future to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to repay indebtedness and to support our general corporate purposes. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of any investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors have purchased their shares. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board, subject to applicable law, and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions that apply to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our Board deems relevant. The agreements governing our First Lien Credit Facilities limit the amounts available to us to pay cash dividends, and, to the extent that we require additional funding, financing sources may prohibit the payment of a dividend. As a consequence of these limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make the payment of dividends on our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock and our trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business and industry. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our\ncommon stock or publish unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock likely would decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause the price of our common stock and trading volume to decline.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Pursuant to our charter, our directors will not be liable to us or any stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty, except (i) acts that breach his or her duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, (ii) acts or omissions without good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of the law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. The bylaws also require us, if so requested, to advance expenses that such director or officer incurred in defending or investigating a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding, provided that such person will return any such advance if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification by us. Any claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to certain exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, any director or our officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate or our amended and restated by-laws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us, any director or our officers or employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our certificate described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision that will be contained in our certificate to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16073, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "COTV"}
