RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATED TO OPERATING OUR BUSINESS\nThe nationwide labor shortage has negatively impacted our ability to recruit chiropractors and other qualified personnel, and the measures we have taken in response have reduced our net revenues.\nThe current nationwide labor shortage has negatively impacted our ability and the ability of our franchisees to recruit and retain qualified chiropractors, wellness coordinators and other qualified personnel. This shortage has limited our ability to open new clinics and has required us to enhance wages and benefits and shorten clinic operating hours. All of these measures have reduced our net revenues and increased our operating expenses and may continue to do so if labor shortages continue.\nNew clinics, once opened, may not be profitable, and the increases in average clinic sales and comparable clinic sales that we have experienced in the past may not be indicative of future results.\nOur clinics continue to demonstrate increases in comparable clinic sales even as they mature. Our annual Comp Sales for the full year 2021, for clinics that have been open for at least 13 full months, was 29%, and for clinics that have been open for greater than 48 months, was 23%. However, we cannot assure you that this will continue for our existing clinics or that clinics we open in the future will see similar results. In new markets, the length of time before average sales for new clinics stabilize is less predictable and can be longer than we expect because of our limited knowledge of these markets and consumers\u2019 limited awareness of our brand. New clinics may not be profitable, and their sales performance may not follow historical patterns. In addition, our average clinic sales and comparable clinic sales for existing clinics may not increase at the rates achieved over the past several years. Our ability to operate new clinics, especially company-owned or managed clinics, profitably and increase average clinic sales and comparable clinic sales depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022consumer awareness and understanding of our brand and changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;\n\u2022general economic conditions, which can affect clinic traffic, local rent and labor costs and prices we pay for the supplies we use;\n\u2022competition, either from our competitors in the chiropractic industry or our own and our franchisees\u2019 clinics;\n\u2022the identification and availability of attractive sites for new facilities and the anticipated commercial, residential and infrastructure development near our new facilities;\n\u2022changes in government regulation;\n\u2022in certain regions, decreases in demand for our services due to inclement weather; and\n\u2022other unanticipated increases in costs, any of which could give rise to delays or cost overruns.\nIf our new clinics do not perform as planned, our business and future prospects could be harmed. In addition, if we are unable to achieve our expected average clinics sales, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.\nOur growth plan includes a significant number of new clinics, focused currently on franchised clinics, and addition of company-owned or managed clinics. Our existing clinic management systems, administrative staff, financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our planned expansion. Those demands on our infrastructure and resources may also adversely affect our ability to manage our existing clinics. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to hire, train and retain managers and team members. We may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on our management, clinic teams and existing infrastructure which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have replaced and upgraded our IT platform in 2021, and we cannot provide assurances that our on-going improvements and enhancements efforts will be executed without delays, difficulties or service interruptions.\nOur long-term strategy involves opening new, company-owned or managed clinics and is subject to many unpredictable factors.\nOne component of our long-term growth strategy is to open new company-owned or managed clinics and to operate those clinics on a profitable basis, often in untested geographic areas. As of December 31, 2021, we owned or managed 96 clinics. Previously, we suspended the development of new company-owned or managed clinics from July 2016 through the fourth quarter of 2018 in order to stabilize our corporate clinic portfolio. We believe we accomplished that goal, and we resumed development of such clinics in 2019, accelerated such development in 2021, and expect to continue to do so in 2022. We have limited or no prior experience operating in a number of geographic areas, particularly in areas in which snow and ice are factors in the winter months. We may encounter difficulties, including reduced patient volume related to inclement weather, as we attempt to expand into those untested geographic areas, and we may not be as successful as we are in geographic areas where we have greater familiarity and brand recognition. We may not be able to open new company-owned or managed clinics as quickly as planned. In the past, we have experienced delays in opening some franchised and company-owned or managed clinics, for various reasons, including construction permitting, landlord responsiveness, and municipal approvals. Such delays could affect future clinic openings. Delays or failures in opening new clinics could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we face challenges locating and securing suitable new clinic sites in our target markets. Competition for those sites is intense, and other retail concepts that compete for those sites may have unit economic models that permit them to bid more aggressively for those sites than we can. There is no guarantee that a sufficient number of suitable sites will be available in desirable areas or on terms that are acceptable to us in order to achieve our growth plan. Our ability to open new clinics also depends on other factors, including:\n\u2022negotiating leases with acceptable terms;\n\u2022attracting qualified chiropractors;\n\u2022identifying, hiring and training qualified employees in each local market;\n\u2022identifying and entering into management agreements with suitable PCs in certain target markets;\n\u2022timely delivery of leased premises to us from our landlords and punctual commencement and completion of construction;\n\u2022managing construction and development costs of new clinics, particularly in competitive markets;\n\u2022obtaining construction materials and labor at acceptable costs, particularly in urban markets;\n\u2022unforeseen engineering or environmental problems with leased premises;\n\u2022generating sufficient funds from operations or obtaining acceptable financing to support our future development;\n\u2022securing required governmental approvals, permits and licenses (including construction permits and operating licenses) in a timely manner and responding effectively to any changes in local, state or federal laws and regulations that adversely affect our costs or ability to open new clinics; and\n\u2022the impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities.\nAny acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of existing franchised clinics to facilitate our growth. We may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates. In addition, we may not be able to continue the operational success of any franchised clinics we acquire or successfully integrate any businesses that we acquire. We may have potential write-offs of acquired assets and an impairment of any goodwill recorded as a result of acquisitions. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition may divert management\u2019s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations or may result in conflicts with our business. Any acquisition may not be successful, may reduce our cash reserves and may negatively affect our earnings and financial performance. We cannot ensure that any acquisitions we make will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur expansion into new markets may be more costly and difficult than we currently anticipate which would result in slower growth than we expect.\nClinics we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction, occupancy, marketing or operating costs than clinics we open in existing markets, thereby affecting our overall profitability. New markets may have competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. We may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity in new markets to build brand awareness. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees who share our vision and culture. We may also incur higher costs from entering new markets, particularly with company-owned or managed clinics if, for example, we hire and assign regional managers to manage comparatively fewer clinics than in more developed markets. For these reasons, both our new franchised clinics and our new company-owned or managed clinics may be less successful than our existing clinics or may achieve target rates of patient visits at a slower rate. If we do not successfully execute our plans to enter new markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOpening new clinics in existing markets may negatively affect revenue at our existing clinics.\nThe target area of our clinics varies by location and depends on a number of factors, including population density, other available retail services, area demographics and geography. As a result, the opening of a new clinic in or near markets in which we already have clinics could adversely affect the revenues of those existing clinics. Existing clinics could also make it more difficult to build our patient base for a new clinic in the same market. Our business strategy does not entail opening new clinics that we believe will materially affect revenue at our existing clinics, but we may selectively open new clinics in and around areas of existing clinics that are operating at or near capacity to effectively serve our patients. Revenue \u201ccannibalization\u201d between our clinics may become significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations and could affect our revenue growth, which could, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDamage to our reputation or our brand in existing or new markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe we have built our reputation on high quality, empathetic patient care, and we must protect and grow the value of our brand to continue to be successful in the future. Our brand may be diminished if we do not continue to make investments in areas such as marketing and advertising, as well as the day-to-day investments required for facility operations, equipment upgrades and staff training. Any incident, real or perceived, regardless of merit or outcome, that erodes our brand, such as failure to comply with federal, state or local regulations including allegations or perceptions of non-compliance or failure to comply with ethical and operating standards, could significantly reduce the value of our brand, expose us to adverse publicity and damage our overall business and reputation. Further, our brand value could suffer and our business could be adversely affected if patients perceive a reduction in the quality of service or staff.\nOur potential need to raise additional capital to accomplish our objectives of expanding into new markets and selectively developing company-owned or managed clinics exposes us to risks, including limiting our ability to develop or acquire clinics and limiting our financial flexibility.\nWe resumed the selective development and acquisition of company-owned or managed clinics in 2019, accelerated such development in 2021, and expect to continue this accelerated development in 2022. If we do not have sufficient cash resources, our ability to develop and acquire clinics could be limited unless we are able to obtain additional capital through future debt or equity financing. Using cash to finance development and acquisition of clinics could limit our financial flexibility by reducing cash available for operating purposes. Using debt financing could result in lenders imposing financial covenants that limit our operations and financial flexibility. Using equity financing may result in dilution of ownership interests of our existing stockholders. We may also use common stock as consideration for the future acquisition of clinics. If our common stock does not maintain a sufficient market value or if prospective acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept our common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their clinics or businesses, we may be required to use more of our cash resources or greater debt financing to complete these acquisitions.\nOur marketing programs may not be successful.\nWe incur costs and expend other resources in our marketing efforts to attract and retain patients. Our marketing activities are principally focused on increasing brand awareness and driving patient volumes. As we open new clinics, we undertake aggressive marketing campaigns to increase community awareness about our growing presence. We plan to continue to utilize targeted marketing efforts within local neighborhoods through channels such as radio, digital media, community sponsorships and events, and a robust online/social media presence. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenue. Our ability to market our services may be restricted or limited by federal or state law.\nWe will be subject to all of the risks associated with leasing space subject to long-term non-cancelable leases for clinics that we intend to operate.\nWe do not own, and we do not intend to own, any of the real property where our company-owned or managed clinics operate. We expect the spaces for the company-owned or managed clinics we intend to open in the future will be leased. We anticipate that our leases generally will have an initial term of five or ten years and generally can be extended only in five-year increments (at increased rates). We expect that all of our leases will require a fixed annual rent, although some may require the payment of additional rent if clinic sales exceed a negotiated amount. We expect that our leases will typically be net leases, which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities, and that these leases will not be cancellable by us. If a future company-owned or managed clinic is not profitable, resulting in its closure, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, we may fail to negotiate renewals as each of our leases expires, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to pay increased occupancy costs or to close clinics in desirable locations. These potential increases in occupancy costs and the cost of closing company-owned or managed clinics could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have settled disputes over future rent with landlords at all of the clinics that we either closed or never opened.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to our operations and may continue to impact our business, key financial and operating metrics, and results of operations in numerous ways that remain unpredictable.\nThere continues to be uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic as the Delta variant and the Omicron variant, which appears to be the most transmissible and contagious variant to date, have caused an increase in COVID-19 cases globally. The pandemic has, at times, negatively impacted our revenue and earnings, and the extent to which the pandemic will impact our business in the future remains uncertain. It will depend on factors such as the duration of the pandemic, the response of national, state and local governments (which could include the reinstatement of restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns), the impact of the Delta and Omicron and other variants that may emerge, the vaccination rates among the population, the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines against the Delta and Omicron and other variants that may emerge, and the longer-term impact of the pandemic on the economy and consumer behavior. Any or all of these factors could continue to affect patient behavior and spending levels and result in reduced visits and patient spending trends. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic retains the potential to further disrupt our business and to continue to cause volatility in the financial markets, which could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and the market price of our stock.\nChanges in economic conditions and adverse weather and other unforeseen conditions could materially affect our ability to maintain or increase sales at our clinics or open new clinics.\nOur services emphasize maintenance therapy, which is generally not a medical necessity, and should be viewed as a discretionary medical expenditure. The United States in general or the specific markets in which we operate may suffer from depressed economic activity, recessionary economic cycles, higher fuel or energy costs, low consumer confidence, high levels of unemployment, reduced home values, increases in home foreclosures, investment losses, personal bankruptcies, reduced access to credit or other economic factors that may affect consumer discretionary spending. Traffic in our clinics could decline if consumers choose to reduce the amount they spend on non-critical medical procedures. Negative economic conditions might cause consumers to make long-term changes to their discretionary spending behavior, including reducing medical discretionary spending on a permanent basis. In addition, given our geographic concentrations in the West, Southwest, Southeast, and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, economic conditions in those particular areas of the country could have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations, and regional occurrences such as local strikes, terrorist attacks, increases in energy prices, adverse weather conditions, tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, droughts, fires or other natural or man-made disasters could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse weather conditions may also impact customer traffic at our clinics. All of our clinics depend on visibility and walk-in traffic, and the effects of adverse weather may decrease visits to malls in which our clinics are located and negatively impact our revenues. If clinic sales decrease, our profitability could decline as we spread fixed costs across a lower level of revenues. Reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential clinic closures could result from prolonged negative clinic sales, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO USE OF THE FRANCHISE BUSINESS MODEL\nOur dependence on the success of our franchisees exposes us to risks including the loss of royalty revenue and harm to our brand.\nA substantial portion of our revenues comes from royalties generated by our franchised clinics, which royalties are based on the revenues generated by those clinics. We anticipate that franchise royalties will represent a substantial part of our revenues in the future. As of December 31, 2021, we had franchisees operating or managing 610 clinics. We rely on the performance of our franchisees in successfully opening and operating their clinics and paying royalties and other fees to us on a timely basis. Our franchise system subjects us to a number of risks as described here and in the next four risk factors. These risks include a significant further decline in our franchisees\u2019 revenue, which has occurred in 2020 as a result of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, in 2020, we took additional actions to support our franchisees that experienced challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, further reducing our royalty revenues and other fees from franchisees. In 2020, for a period of time, we waived minimum royalty requirements, monthly software fees for clinics forced to close temporarily due to the pandemic, and minimum required marketing expenditures. We may need to re-implement, expand or extend these accommodations to franchisees, further reducing our revenues from franchised clinics and reducing the visibility of \u201cThe Joint\u201d brand in the marketplace. Any new or re-implemented accommodations and the occurrence of any of the other events described here and in the next four risk factors could impact our ability to collect royalty payments from our franchisees, harm the goodwill associated with our brand, and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur franchisees are independent operators over whom we have limited control.\nFranchisees are independent operators, and their employees are not our employees. Accordingly, their actions are outside of our control. Although we have developed criteria to evaluate and screen prospective franchisees, we cannot be certain that our franchisees will have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to operate successful franchises in their approved locations, and state franchise laws may limit our ability to terminate or modify these franchise agreements. Moreover, despite our training, support and monitoring, franchisees may not successfully operate clinics in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, or may not hire and adequately train qualified personnel. The failure of our franchisees to operate their franchises successfully and the actions taken by their employees could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our brand and our ability to attract prospective franchisees, and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk that our franchise agreements may be terminated or not renewed.\nEach franchise agreement is subject to termination by us as the franchisor in the event of a default, generally after expiration of applicable cure periods, although under certain circumstances a franchise agreement may be terminated by us upon notice without an opportunity to cure. The default provisions under the franchise agreements are drafted broadly and include, among other things, any failure to meet operating standards and actions that may threaten our intellectual property. In addition, each franchise agreement has an expiration date. Upon the expiration of the franchise agreement, we or the franchisee may, or may not, elect to renew the franchise agreement. If the franchise agreement is renewed, the franchisee will receive a new franchise agreement for an additional term. Such option, however, is contingent on the franchisee\u2019s execution of the then- current form of franchise agreement (which may include increased royalty payments, advertising fees and other costs) and the payment of a renewal fee. If a franchisee is unable or unwilling to satisfy any of the foregoing conditions, we may elect not to renew the expiring franchise agreement, in which event the franchise agreement will terminate upon expiration of its term. The termination or non-renewal of a franchise agreement could result in the reduction of royalty payments we receive.\nOur franchisees may not meet timetables for opening their clinics, which could reduce the royalties we receive.\nOur franchise agreements specify a timetable for opening the clinic. Failure by our franchisees to open their clinics within the specified time limit would result in the reduction of royalty payments we would have otherwise received and could result in the termination of the franchise agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we had active licenses and letters-of-intent for 283 clinics which we believe to be developable within the specified time periods.\nOur regional developers are independent operators over whom we have limited control.\nOur regional developers are independent operators. Accordingly, their actions are outside of our control. We depend upon our regional developers to sell a minimum number of franchises within their territory and to assist the purchasers of those franchises to develop and operate their clinics. The failure by regional developers to sell the specified minimum number of franchises within the time limits set forth in their regional developer license agreements would reduce the franchise fees we would otherwise receive, delay the payment of royalties to us and result in a potential event of default under the regional developer license agreement. Of our total of 22 regional developers as of December 31, 2021, three had not met their minimum franchise sales requirements within the time periods specified in their regional developer agreements.\nFINANCIAL RISK FACTORS\nOur level of debt could impair our financial condition and ability to operate.\nIn 2020, in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we drew down $2.0 million under the Credit Agreement. Our level of debt could have important consequences to investors, including:\n\u2022requiring a portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations or other capital needs;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate because our available cash flow, after paying principal and interest on our debt, may not be sufficient to make the capital and other expenditures necessary to address these changes;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, since we will be required to devote a proportion of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our debt during periods in which we experience lower earnings and cash flow, such as during the current COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate requirements; and\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other relatively less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate requirements.\nWe have identified weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or maintain investor confidence.\nWe are subject to the internal control requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, our independent registered public accounting firm is now required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, since as of December 31, 2021, we became a large accelerated filer.\nInternal controls related to the operation of financial reporting and accounting systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As discussed in Part II, Item 9A of this report, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2021, and our auditors expressed an adverse opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, due to a material weakness related to: (i) segregation of duties associated with administrative access to the Company\u2019s financial reporting and accounting system, and (ii) lack of documentations related to certain revenue recognitions and leases. We have undertaken, and will continue to implement, remediation measures to address the material weakness, which measures will result in additional technology and other compliance expenses. We expect that remediation will be completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2022; however, the weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We cannot provide assurances that the material weakness will be effectively remediated. Furthermore, we have had material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting in prior years which have been remediated. We cannot provide any assurance that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future.\nIf we are unable to remediate the current or any future material weaknesses when they arise or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, to prevent fraud, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected. This could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.\nOur balance sheet includes intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge recorded in our operating results, which could be material.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Also, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of our goodwill or another intangible asset were to exceed its fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value, with the impairment charge recognized as a noncash expense in our operating results. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations, including, for example, as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic, may impact our projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potentially material impairment charge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nOur balance sheet includes a significant number of long-lived assets in our corporate clinics, including operating lease right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment. A decline in the current and projected cash flows in our corporate clinics could result in impairment charges, which could be material.\nLong-lived assets, such as operating lease right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment in our corporate clinics, are tested for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset were to exceed its fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value and an impairment charge recognized as a noncash expense in our operating results. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations, including, for example, as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic, may impact our projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potentially material impairment charge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our long-lived assets.\nOur increased reliance on sources of revenue other than from franchise and regional developer licenses exposes us to risks including the loss of revenue and reduction of working capital.\nFrom the commencement of our operations until we began to acquire or open company-owned or managed clinics, we relied exclusively on the sale of franchises and regional developer licenses as sources of revenue until the franchises we sold began to generate royalty revenues. As our portfolio of company-owned or managed clinics matures, we have placed less reliance on these franchise sources of revenue. As we develop further company-owned or managed clinics, we will be required to use our working capital to operate our business. If the opening of our company-owned or managed clinics is delayed or if the cost of developing company-owned or managed clinics exceeds our expectations, we may experience insufficient working capital to fully implement our development plans, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced net losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have experienced periods of net losses in the past, and while we have achieved profitability since 2018, our revenue may not grow and we may not maintain profitability in the future. Our ability to maintain profitability will be affected by the other risks and uncertainties described in this section and in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis. If we are not able to sustain or increase profitability, our business will be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND COMPETITION\nOur clinics and chiropractors compete for patients in a highly competitive environment that may make it more difficult to increase patient volumes and revenues.\nThe business of providing chiropractic services is highly competitive in each of the markets in which our clinics operate. The primary bases of such competition are quality of care, reputation, price of services, marketing and advertising strategy implementation, convenience, traffic flow, visibility of office locations, and hours of operation. Our clinics compete with all other chiropractors in their local market. Many of those chiropractors have established practices and reputations in their markets. Some of these competitors and potential competitors may have financial resources, affiliation models, reputations or management expertise that provide them with competitive advantages over us, which may make it difficult to compete against them. Our three largest multi-unit competitors are Airrosti, which currently operates 169 clinics; HealthSource Chiropractic, which currently operates 149 clinics; and ChiroOne Wellness Centers, which currently operates 78 clinics. Two of these competitors are currently operating under an insurance-based model. In addition, a number of other chiropractic franchises and chiropractic practices that are attempting to duplicate or follow our business model are currently operating in our markets and in other parts of the country and may enter our existing markets in the future.\nOur success is dependent on the chiropractors who control the professional corporations, or PC owners, with whom we enter into management services agreements, and we may have difficulty locating qualified chiropractors to replace PC owners.\nIn states that regulate the corporate practice of chiropractic, our chiropractic services are provided by legal entities organized under state laws as professional corporations, or PCs, and their equivalents. Each PC employs or contracts with chiropractors in one or more offices. Each of the PCs is wholly owned by one or more licensed chiropractors, or medical professionals as state law may require, and we do not own any capital stock of any PC. We and our franchisees that are not owned by chiropractors enter into management services agreements with PCs, to provide to the PCs on an exclusive basis, all non-clinical services of the chiropractic practice. The PC owner is critical to the success of a clinic because he or she has control of all clinical aspects of the practice of chiropractic and the provision of chiropractic services. Upon the departure of a PC owner, we may not be able to locate one or more suitably qualified licensed chiropractors to hold the ownership interest in the PC and maintain the success of the departing PC owner.\nRISKS RELATED TO STATE REGULATION OF THE CORPORATE PRACTICE OF CHIROPRACTIC\nOur management services agreements, according to which we provide non-clinical services to affiliated PCs, could be challenged by a state or chiropractor under laws regulating the practice of chiropractic. Some state chiropractic boards have made inquiries concerning our business model or have proposed or adopted changes to their rules that could be interpreted to pose a threat to our business model.\nThe laws of every state in which we operate contain restrictions on the practice of chiropractic and control over the provision of chiropractic services. The laws of many states where we operate permit a chiropractor to conduct a chiropractic practice only as an individual, a member of a partnership or an employee of a PC, limited liability company or limited liability partnership. These laws typically prohibit chiropractors from splitting fees with non-chiropractors and prohibit non-chiropractic entities, such as chiropractic management services organizations, from owning or operating chiropractic clinics or engaging in the practice of chiropractic and from employing chiropractors. The specific restrictions against the corporate practice of chiropractic, as well as the interpretation of those restrictions by state regulatory authorities, vary from state to state. However, the restrictions are generally designed to prohibit a non-chiropractic entity from controlling or directing clinical care decision-making, engaging chiropractors to practice chiropractic or sharing professional fees. The form of management agreement that we utilize, and that we recommend to our franchisees that are management service organizations, explicitly prohibits the management service organization from controlling or directing clinical care decisions. However, there can be no assurance that all of our franchisees that are management service organizations will strictly follow the provisions in our recommended form of management agreement. The laws of many states also prohibit chiropractic practitioners from paying any portion of fees received for chiropractic services in consideration for the referral of a patient. Any challenge to our contractual relationships with our affiliated PCs by chiropractors or regulatory authorities could result in a finding that could have a material adverse effect on our operations, such as voiding one or more management services agreements. Moreover, the laws and regulatory environment may change to restrict or limit the enforceability of our management services agreements. We could be prevented from affiliating with chiropractor-owned PCs or providing comprehensive business services to them in one or more states. Please see \u201cPart I, Item 1 - Business - Regulatory Environment - State regulations on corporate practice of chiropractic\u201d for a description of certain of these actions by states, including state legislatures, state chiropractic regulatory bodies and a state attorney general, to regulate and restrict the corporate practice of chiropractic.\nRISKS RELATED TO OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS\nExpected new federal regulations under the Biden administration expanding the meaning of \u201cjoint employer\u201d and evolving state laws increase our potential liability for employment law violations by our franchisees and the likelihood that we may be required to participate in collective bargaining with our franchisees\u2019 employees.\nFEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS ON JOINT EMPLOYER LIABILITY\nBackground\nAs a franchisor, we could be liable for certain employment law and other labor-related claims against our franchisees if we are found to be a joint employer of our franchisees\u2019 employees.\nA July 2014 decision by the United States National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) held that McDonald\u2019s Corporation could be held liable as a \u201cjoint employer\u201d for labor and wage violations by its franchisees under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). After this decision, the NLRB issued a number of complaints against McDonald\u2019s Corporation in connection with\nthese violations, although these complaints were ultimately settled without any admission of liability by McDonald\u2019s. Additionally, an August 2015 decision by the NLRB held that Browning-Ferris Industries was a \u201cjoint employer\u201d for purposes of collective bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and, thus, obligated to negotiate with the Teamsters union over workers supplied by a contract staffing firm within one of its recycling plants.\nIn an effort to effectively reverse the McDonald\u2019s Corporation decision, in 2020, the Department of Labor (DOL) issued a final rule narrowing the meaning of \u201cjoint employer\u201d in the FLSA. Much of the new rule relating to \u201cjoint employer\u201d status was then vacated by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in a lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general, which decision was appealed by the DOL. Similarly, in an effort to effectively reverse the Browning-Ferris decision, in 2020, the NLRB issued a final rule, narrowing the meaning of \u201cjoint employer\u201d in the collective bargaining context under the NLRA.\nCurrent Status\nThe Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, supported by the Biden administration, was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in March 2021, but is now stalled in the Senate. The PRO Act, among other things, seeks to codify for purposes of the NLRA the Browning-Ferris expansive interpretation of \u201cjoint employer.\u201d The PRO Act requires the NLRB and courts to consider not only an entity\u2019s direct control, but to also consider an entity\u2019s indirect control, over an individual\u2019s terms and conditions of employment, including any reserved authority to control such terms and conditions, which standing alone, can be sufficient to make a finding of a \u201cjoint employer\u201d relationship.\nIn addition, in September 2021, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) filed a lawsuit seeking to strike down the NLRA final rule, and in December 2021, the NLRB announced in its federal regulatory agenda that it would rework the NLRA final rule governing joint employment. The expectation is that the NLRB will reinstate the more expansive interpretation of \u201cjoint employer\u201d under the NLRA.\nUnder the NLRA, a joint employer may be required to bargain with a union representing jointly employed workers, may be subject to joint liability for unfair labor practices committed by the other employer and may be subject to labor picketing that otherwise would be unlawful. An expansion of the meaning of \u201cjoint employer\u201d under the NLRA could subject franchisors to potential liability for unfair labor practices by their franchisees and require them to participate in collective bargaining with a franchisee\u2019s employees, depending on the degree of control exercised by the franchisor over the franchisee\u2019s employees.\nEffective on September 28, 2021, the DOL withdrew the joint employer final rules under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which had narrowed the definition of \u201cjoint employer\u201d under the FLSA. Key provisions of the joint employer final rules had already been vacated by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in a lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general. The DOL has not proposed to replace the withdrawn rule with any new guidance, reverting to a legal landscape which includes a more expansive definition of \u201cjoint employer.\u201d Under a more expansive definition, a franchisor could be held jointly liable with its franchisee for minimum wages and overtime pay violations by the franchisee, depending on the extent of control and supervision the franchisor is able to exercise over the franchisee\u2019s employees.\nIn addition to efforts to expand the definition of \u201cjoint employer\u201d through the withdrawal of the FLSA rule, as well as the SEIU lawsuit and the expected regulatory action with respect to the NLRA, it is expected that the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC), which enforces anti-discrimination laws, will issue rules which include an expansive definition of \u201cjoint employer.\u201d\nSTATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ON JOINT EMPLOYER LIABILITY\nCalifornia adopted Assembly Bill 5, or AB-5, which took effect on January 1, 2020. This legislation codified the standard established in a California Supreme Court case (Dynamex Operations West v. Superior Court) for determining whether workers should be classified as employees or independent contractors, with a strict test that put the burden of proof on employers to establish that workers are not employees. The law was aimed at the so-called \u201cgig economy\u201d where workers in many industries are treated as independent contractors, rather than employees, and lack the protections of wage and hour laws, although California voters recently approved a ballot initiative, now under court review, to exclude app-based drivers from the application of AB-5. AB-5 is not a franchise-specific law and does not address joint employer liability; however, a significant concern exists in the franchise industry that an expansive interpretation of AB-5 or similar law could be used to hold franchisors jointly liable for the labor law violations of its franchisees. Courts addressing this issue have come to differing conclusions, and while it remains uncertain as to how the joint employer issue will finally be resolved in California, potential new federal laws or regulations may ultimately be controlling on this issue.\nAB-5 has been the subject of widespread national discussion. Other states are considering similar approaches. Some states have adopted similar laws in narrower contexts, and a handful of other states have adopted similar laws for broader purposes. All of these laws or proposed laws may similarly raise concerns with respect to the expansion of joint liability to the franchise industry. Furthermore, there have been private lawsuits in which parties have alleged that a franchisor and its franchisee \u201cjointly employ\u201d the franchisee\u2019s staff, that the franchisor is responsible for the franchisees\u2019 staff (under theories of apparent agency, ostensible agency, or actual agency), or otherwise.\nIMPACT OF FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ON FRANCHISE BUSINESS MODEL\nEvolving labor and employment laws, rules and regulations, and theories of liability could result in expensive litigation and potential claims against us as a franchisor for labor and employment-related and other liabilities that have historically been borne by franchisees. This could negatively impact the franchise business model, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated industry, and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, we could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nWe, our franchisees and the chiropractor-owned PCs to which we and our franchisees provide management services are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, including:\n\u2022state regulations on the practice of chiropractic;\n\u2022the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, and other federal and state laws governing the collection, dissemination, use, security and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health and financial information;\n\u2022federal and state laws and regulations which contain anti-kickback and fee-splitting provisions and restrictions on referrals;\n\u2022the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and similar state laws that restrict the methods that we and third-party collection companies may use to contact and seek payment from patients regarding past due accounts; and\n\u2022state and federal labor laws, including wage and hour laws.\nMany of the above laws, rules and regulations applicable to us, our franchisees and our affiliated PCs are ambiguous, have not been definitively interpreted by courts or regulatory authorities and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Accordingly, we may not be able to predict how these laws and regulations will be interpreted or applied by courts and regulatory authorities, and some of our activities could be challenged. In addition, we must consistently monitor changes in the laws and regulations that govern our operations. Furthermore, a review of our business by judicial, law enforcement or regulatory authorities could result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations. Although we have tried to structure our business and contractual relationships in compliance with these laws, rules and regulations in all material respects, if any aspect of our operations were found to violate applicable laws, rules or regulations, we could be subject to significant fines or other penalties, required to cease operations in a particular jurisdiction, prevented from commencing operations in a particular state or otherwise be required to revise the structure of our business or legal arrangements. Our efforts to comply with these laws, rules and regulations may impose significant costs and burdens, and failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations may result in fines or other charges being imposed on us.\nOur chiropractors are subject to ethical guidelines and operating standards which, if not complied with, could adversely affect our business.\nThe chiropractors who work in our system are subject to ethical guidelines and operating standards of professional and trade associations and private accreditation agencies. Compliance with these guidelines and standards is often required by our contracts with our chiropractors, patients and franchise owners (and their contractual relationships) and serve to maintain our reputation. The guidelines and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future. New or changed guidelines or standards may materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, a review of our business by accreditation authorities could result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations.\nWe, along with our affiliated PCs and their chiropractors, are subject to malpractice and other similar claims and may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate insurance against these claims.\nThe provision of chiropractic services by chiropractors entails an inherent risk of potential malpractice and other similar claims. While we do not have responsibility for compliance by affiliated PCs and their chiropractors with regulatory and other requirements directly applicable to chiropractors, claims, suits or complaints relating to services provided at the offices of our franchisees or affiliated PCs may be asserted against us. As we develop company-owned or managed clinics, our exposure to malpractice claims will increase. We have experienced a number of malpractice claims since our founding in March, 2010, which we have defended or are vigorously defending and do not expect their outcome to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The assertion or outcome of these claims could result in higher administrative and legal expenses, including settlement costs or litigation damages. Our current minimum professional liability insurance coverage required for our franchisees, affiliated PCs and company-owned clinics is $1.0 million per occurrence and $3.0 million in annual aggregate. In addition, we have a corporate business owner\u2019s policy with coverage of $2.0 million per occurrence and $4.0 million in annual aggregate. If we are unable to obtain adequate insurance, our franchisees or franchisee doctors fail to name the Company as an additional insured party, or if there is an increase in the future cost of insurance to us and the chiropractors who provide chiropractic services or an increase in the amount we have to self-insure, there may be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nEvents or rumors relating to our brand names or our ability to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties could significantly impact our business.\nRecognition of our brand names, including \u201cTHE JOINT CHIROPRACTIC\u201d, and the association of those brands with quality, convenient and inexpensive chiropractic maintenance care, are an integral part of our business. The occurrence of any events or rumors that cause patients to no longer associate the brands with quality, convenient and inexpensive chiropractic maintenance care may materially adversely affect the value of the brand names and demand for chiropractic services at our franchisees or their affiliated PCs.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including but not limited to our trademarks. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, or to defend against claims by third parties that the conduct of our businesses or our use of intellectual property infringes upon such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected as a result.\nRISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY\nWe are subject to the data privacy, security and breach notification requirements of HIPAA and other data privacy and security laws, and the failure to comply with these rules, or allegations that we have failed to do so, can result in civil or criminal sanctions.\nHIPAA required the United States Department of Health and Human Service, or HHS, to adopt standards to protect the privacy and security of certain health-related information. The HIPAA privacy regulations contain detailed requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information and the grant of certain rights to patients with respect to such information by \u201ccovered entities.\u201d As a provider of healthcare who conducts certain electronic transactions, each of our clinics is considered a covered entity under HIPAA. We have taken actions to comply with the HIPAA privacy regulations and believe that we are in compliance with those regulations. In addition to the privacy requirements, HIPAA covered entities must implement certain administrative, physical and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of certain electronic health-related information received, maintained or transmitted by covered entities or their business associates. We have taken actions in an effort to be in compliance with these security regulations and believe that we are in compliance, however, a security incident that bypasses our information security systems causing an information security breach, loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws or a material disruption of our operational systems could result in a material adverse impact on our business, along with fines. Oversight of HIPAA compliance, including ongoing implementation of security measures, involves significant time, effort and expense.\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, as implemented in part by an omnibus final rule published in the Federal Register on January 25, 2013, further requires that patients be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of their unsecured protected health information, or PHI, that compromises the privacy or security of such information. HHS has established the presumption that all unauthorized uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information constitute breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. HITECH and implementing regulations specify that such\nnotifications must be made without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported immediately to HHS, which will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website. Breaches affecting 500 patients or more in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the local media. If a breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity must record it in a log and notify HHS of such breaches at least annually. These breach notification requirements apply not only to unauthorized disclosures of unsecured PHI to outside third parties, but also to unauthorized internal access to or use of such PHI.\nHITECH significantly expanded the scope of the privacy and security requirements under HIPAA and increased penalties for violations. The amount of penalty that may be assessed depends, in part, upon the culpability of the applicable covered entity or business associate in committing the violation. Some penalties for certain violations that were not due to \u201cwillful neglect\u201d may be waived by the Secretary of HHS in whole or in part, to the extent that the payment of the penalty would be excessive relative to the violation. HITECH also authorized state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of residents of their states. Applicable courts may award damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. HITECH also mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of a cross-section of HIPAA covered entities and business associates. Every covered entity and business associate is subject to being audited, regardless of the entity\u2019s compliance record.\nStates may impose more protective privacy restrictions in laws related to health information and may afford individuals a private right of action with respect to the violation of such laws. Both state and federal laws are subject to modification or enhancement of privacy protection at any time. We are subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These statutes vary and could impose additional requirements on us and more severe penalties for disclosures of health information. If we fail to comply with HIPAA or similar state laws, including laws addressing data confidentiality, security or breach notification, we could incur substantial monetary penalties and our reputation could be damaged.\nIn addition, states may also impose restrictions related to the confidentiality of personal information that is not considered \u201cprotected health information\u201d under HIPAA. Such information may include certain identifying information and financial information of our patients. Theses state laws may impose additional notification requirements in the event of a breach of such personal information. Failure to comply with such data confidentiality, security and breach notification laws may result in substantial monetary penalties.\nOur business model depends on proprietary and third-party management information systems that we use to, among other things, track financial and operating performance of our clinics, and any failure to successfully design and maintain these systems or implement new systems could materially harm our operations.\nWe depend on integrated management information systems, some of which are provided by third parties, and standardized procedures for operational and financial information, patient records and billing operations. In 2021, we replaced, upgraded and rolled out our new IT platform, and any problems with system performance after implementation could cause disruptions in our business operations, given the pervasive impact of the new system on our processes. In general, we may experience unanticipated delays, complications, data breaches or expenses in replacing, upgrading, implementing, integrating, and operating our systems. Our management information systems regularly require modifications, improvements or replacements that may require both substantial expenditures as well as interruptions in operations. Our ability to implement these systems is subject to the availability of skilled information technology specialists to assist us in creating, implementing and supporting these systems. Our failure to successfully design, implement and maintain all of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or to strategically implement, upgrade or consolidate existing information systems, our reputation and business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe increasingly use electronic means to interact with our customers and collect, maintain and store individually identifiable information, including, but not limited to, personal financial information and health-related information. Despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of cyber terrorism, vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Additionally, the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our businesses are regulated at the federal and state levels as well as by certain financial industry groups, such as the Payment Card Industry organization. Federal, state and financial industry groups may also consider from time-to-time new privacy and security requirements that may apply to our businesses. Compliance with evolving privacy and security laws, requirements, and regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, new limitations or constraints on our business models and the development of new administrative\nprocesses. They also may impose further restrictions on our collection, disclosure and use of individually identifiable information that is housed in one or more of our databases. Noncompliance with privacy laws, financial industry group requirements or a security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of personal, sensitive and/or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our vendors, could have material adverse effects on our business, operations, reputation and financial condition, including decreased revenue; material fines and penalties; increased financial processing fees; compensatory, statutory, punitive or other damages; adverse actions against our licenses to do business; and injunctive relief whether by court or consent order.\nIf our security systems are breached, we may face civil liability and public perception of our security measures could be diminished, either of which would negatively affect our ability to attract and retain patients.\nTechniques used to gain unauthorized access to corporate data systems are constantly evolving, and there is a potential for increased cyber-attacks and security challenges as our employees and employees of our vendors and franchisees work remotely from non-corporate managed networks during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to data pertaining to our patients, including credit card and debit card information and other personally identifiable information. Our systems, which are supported by our own systems and those of third-party vendors, are vulnerable to computer malware, trojans, viruses, worms, break-ins, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, attempts to access our servers in an unauthorized manner, or other attacks on and disruptions of our and third-party vendor computer systems, any of which could lead to system interruptions, delays, or shutdowns, causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized access to personally identifiable information. If an actual or perceived breach of security occurs on our systems or a vendor\u2019s systems, we may face civil liability and reputational damage, either of which would negatively affect our ability to attract and retain patients. We also would be required to expend significant resources to mitigate the breach of security and to address related matters.\nWe may not be able to effectively control the unauthorized actions of third parties who may have access to the patient data we collect. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to maintain the security of data relating to our patients and employees, and to comply with our posted privacy policy, laws and regulations, rules of self-regulatory organizations, industry standards and contractual provisions to which we may be bound, could result in the loss of confidence in us, or result in actions against us by governmental entities or others, all of which could result in litigation and financial losses, and could potentially cause us to lose patients, revenue and employees.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to credit card and debit card payments we accept.\nWe accept payments through credit and debit card transactions. For credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time. An increase in those fees would require us to either increase the prices we charge for our services, which could cause us to lose patients and revenue, or absorb an increase in our operating expenses, either of which could harm our operating results.\nIf we or any of our processing vendors have problems with our billing software, or the billing software malfunctions, it could have an adverse effect on patient satisfaction and could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products. In addition, if our billing software fails to work properly, and as a result, we do not automatically process monthly membership fees to our patients\u2019 credit cards on a timely basis or at all, or there are issues with financial insolvency of our third-party vendors or other unanticipated problems or events, we could lose revenue, which would harm our operating results.\nWe are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it more difficult for us to comply. Based on the self-assessment completed as of May 16, 2021, we are currently in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, the payment card industry\u2019s security standard for companies that collect, store or transmit certain data regarding credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders and credit and debit card transactions. There is no guarantee that we will maintain PCI DSS compliance. Our failure to comply fully with PCI DSS in the future could violate payment card association operating rules, federal and state laws and regulations and the terms of our contracts with payment processors and merchant banks. Such failure to comply fully also could subject us to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability and could result in the suspension or loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments. Although we do not store credit card information and we do not have access to our patients\u2019 credit card information, there is no guarantee that PCI DSS compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft, loss, or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders and credit and debit card transactions.\nIf we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher credit card-related costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to maintain our chargeback or refund rates at acceptable levels, credit and debit card companies may increase our transaction fees, impose monthly fines until resolved or terminate their relationships with us. Any increases in our credit and debit card fees could adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if we elect not to raise our rates for our service to offset the increase. The termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nShort-selling strategies and negative opinions posted on the internet may drive down the market price of our common stock and could result in class action lawsuits.\nShort selling occurs when an investor borrows a security and sells it on the open market, with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares. Because it is in the short seller's best interests for the price of the stock to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding an issuer, its business prospects, and similar matters which may create a negative depiction of the company. This information is often widely distributed, including through platforms that mainly serve as hosts seeking advertising revenue. Issuers who have limited trading volumes and are thus susceptible to higher volatility levels than large-cap stocks can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks.\nWe may be subject to short selling strategies that may drive down the market price of our common stock. We were recently the target of negative allegations posted on an internet platform designed to advise short sellers, which precipitated a decline in the price of our stock. Shortly thereafter, several plaintiffs' law firms announced investigations into potential securities laws violations based on these allegations. While we believe these allegations are without merit, and no litigation has yet been commenced regarding such allegations, we still face the potential for litigation to be initiated against us. While we would vigorously defend against any such litigation, regardless of outcome, litigation can be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention of our management team, adversely impact our reputation and brand, and if a plaintiff claim were successful, could result in significant liability, all of which could harm our business and financial condition.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price and our share price may decline due to the large number of shares eligible for future sale or exchange.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. As of December 31, 2021, we had 14,419,712 outstanding shares of common stock and are authorized to sell up to 20,000,000 shares of common stock. The trading volume of shares of our common stock averaged approximately 208,341 shares per day during the year ended December 31, 2021. Accordingly, sales of even small amounts of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders may drive down the trading price of our common stock.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In addition, we have entered and expect to continue to enter into agreements to indemnify our directors, executive officers and other employees as determined by our Board of Directors. Under the terms of such indemnification agreements, we are required to indemnify each of our directors and officers, to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the state of Delaware, if the basis of the indemnitee\u2019s involvement was by reason of the fact that the indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or was serving at the Company\u2019s request in an official capacity for another entity. We must indemnify our officers and directors against all reasonable fees, expenses, charges and other costs of any type or nature whatsoever, including any and all expenses and obligations paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in, participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness or participate in any completed, actual, pending or threatened action, suit, claim or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, or establishing or enforcing a right to indemnification under the indemnification agreement. The indemnification agreements also require us, if so requested, to advance within 30 days of such request all reasonable fees, expenses, charges and other costs that such director or officer incurred, provided that such person will return any such advance if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification by us. Any claims for indemnification by our\ndirectors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims and may reduce the amount of money available to us.", "PERMNO": 15072, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "JYNT"}
