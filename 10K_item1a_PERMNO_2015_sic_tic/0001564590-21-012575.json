The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may be unable to continue to generate revenue from the provision of our connectivity services, which could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to continuously attract and retain users of our connectivity and other service offerings, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts or that customer retention levels will not materially decline. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Gogo service we provided on business aircraft (which excludes service provided on commercial aircraft under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement) generated approximately 78%, 72% and 68% of our revenue from continuing operations, respectively. A significant portion of such service revenue is generated through individual subscription agreements with our customers that cover a single or small number of aircraft, with the remainder generated through subscription agreements with certain fractional or charter operators covering larger fleets of aircraft. These agreements are generally no more than one-year in duration. As such, we have no assurance that any of such customers will renew their existing agreements with us upon expiration on comparable terms or at all, including as a result of a lack of demand or dissatisfaction with our services or the availability of superior or less expensive alternatives in the market. In addition, our subscription agreements are generally terminable at will by our customers and, if terminated, we may not be able to collect amounts we would have otherwise expected to receive during the full term of the agreement. To the extent that our subscribers terminate or fail to renew their contracts with us for any reason, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur subscription agreements do not generally contain minimum commitments for the usage of our connectivity and other services. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of reduced usage of our services by our customers or allow customers to suspend their accounts, which could adversely impact our results of operations and profitability. For example, we experienced a sharp decrease in flight activity, an increase in account suspensions and a decrease in new plan activities in the second quarter and, to a lesser extent, in the third quarter, of 2020 as a result of reduced travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe are reliant on our key OEMs and dealers for equipment sales.\nRevenue from equipment sales accounted for approximately 21%, 28% and 32% of our revenue from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. More than 90% of our equipment revenue in each such fiscal year was generated from contracts with OEMs and after-market dealers. Almost all of our contracts with OEMs and dealers are terminable at will by either party on short notice. If one or more key OEMs or dealers terminates its relationship with us for any reason or our contract expires and is not renewed, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, pursuant to many of our contracts with our OEM distribution partners, we have agreed to deliver equipment and/or services, including equipment and services not yet in production, for a fixed price and, accordingly, take the risk of any cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product. Certain of our contracts with our OEMs also include provisions that, under specified circumstances, entitle them to the benefit of certain more favorable provisions in other equipment contracts, including with respect to pricing. These provisions, some of which have retroactive effect, may limit the benefits we realize from contracts containing such provisions. Our inability to identify and offer improved terms to a distribution partner or customer in accordance with such a\nprovision could negatively affect our relationship with that distribution partner or customer or give rise to a claim that we are in breach of such contract.\nMany of our distribution partners have also not committed to purchase any minimum quantity of our equipment. In certain cases, we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon non-binding production schedules provided by OEMs, historical purchasing patterns and informal discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements. Cancellations, reductions or delays by OEMS and dealers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur distribution partners may be materially adversely impacted by economic downturns and market disruptions. In anticipation of changing economic conditions, OEMs in particular may be more conservative in their production, which may reduce our market opportunities. Further, unfavorable market conditions could cause one or more of OEMs or dealers to file for bankruptcy, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition could result in price reduction, reduced revenue and loss of market position and could harm our results of operations.\nOur equipment and service are sold in competitive markets. Some of our current or potential future competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production, and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand pricing pressures and the effects of periodic economic downturns. Some of our current or future competitors may offer a broader product line or broader geographic coverage to customers. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if our competitors:\n\u2022\ndevelop equipment or service that is superior to our equipment and service;\n\u2022\ndevelop equipment or service that is priced more competitively than our equipment and service;\n\u2022\ndevelop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing equipment and services; or\n\u2022\nadapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.\nWe believe that the principal points of competition in our business are technological capabilities, price, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, compliance with regulatory certification requirements, quality of support after the sale and timeliness of delivery and installation. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in technology, manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer. In addition, competition may subject us to downward pricing pressures. Pricing at too high a level could adversely affect our ability to gain new customers and retain current customers, while increased competition could force us to lower our prices or lose market position and could adversely affect growth prospects and profitability. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or support capabilities to continue to compete successfully. A failure to respond to established and new competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. A competitor is developing a North American air-to-ground 4G network using unlicensed spectrum and has announced that it will launch in-flight connectivity service in the continental United States in 2021. Other competitors could enter this business using the same or other air-to-ground spectrum. Another in-flight connectivity provider has launched service on commercial aircraft in Europe using a hybrid air-to-ground/satellite network. We do not currently offer satellite-based broadband service, and could face competition, particularly outside of North America, from owners of low earth orbit and other new non-geostationary satellite constellations should they decide to enter our market.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to combat it have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was reported in Wuhan, China, and the World Health Organization (the \u201cWHO\u201d) subsequently declared COVID-19 a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International\nConcern.\u201d On March 13, 2020, the U.S. government declared a national emergency and on March 19, 2020, the U.S. Department of State issued a global Level 4 \u201cdo not travel\u201d advisory advising U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19. The U.S. government has also implemented enhanced screenings, mandatory quarantine requirements and other travel restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, including restrictions on travel from Asia, Europe, Mexico and Canada, and many foreign and U.S. state governments have instituted similar measures (including travel restrictions to and within the European Union) and declared states of emergency. At various points, most states and U.S. territories have issued instructions for their residents to stay home or \u201cshelter in place\u201d and to avoid any non-essential travel for varied durations of time and may lift, have lifted or will be lifting or easing these instructions at varied times, often with certain restrictions still in place. In addition, depending on the results of any easing or lifting of instructions and other restrictions, federal, state or local governments or authorities may determine to reinstate, enhance or enforce the same or other instructions or restrictions in the future. Governments, non-governmental organizations and entities in the private sector have also issued and may continue to issue non-binding advisories or recommendations regarding air travel or other social distancing measures, including limitations on the number of persons that should be present at public gatherings.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decline in international and domestic business aviation travel, which materially and adversely affected our business in 2020. Beginning in March 2020, our business saw a sharp decrease in flight activity, as well as an increase in requests for account suspensions and decreases in new plan activations. Though we continue to see strong signs of recovery from the lows we experienced in mid-April 2020, there can be no assurance that such recovery will continue at the current pace or at all. The impact of the pandemic has varied across different parts of our customer base - for example corporate flight departments, charter operators and commercial aircraft (under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement) - and we expect the pace of recovery to vary by type of customer also. The negative impact of COVID-19 on demand for commercial air travel could have an adverse effect on the revenue share payable to us by Intelsat under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement.\nWe expect COVID-19 to continue to negatively impact our business and we are unable to predict how long or with what degree of severity that impact will continue. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our financial and operational performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the timetable for administering and efficacy of vaccines, the duration and geographic scope of related travel advisories and restrictions and the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on overall demand for commercial and business aviation travel, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn addition to directly impacting demand for air travel, COVID-19 and related restrictions may have a material and adverse impact on other aspects of our business, including:\n\u2022\ndelays and difficulties in completing installations on certain aircraft;\n\u2022\ndelays or shortages in our supply chain;\n\u2022\nour competitive position, including with respect to connectivity providers that do not operate exclusively in the aviation industry; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to market and grow our business and to promote technological innovation.\nAt this time we are also not able to predict whether the COVID-19 pandemic will result in long-term changes to business practices and consumer behavior, with such changes including but not limited to a long-term reduction in travel as a result of increased usage of \u201cvirtual\u201d and \u201cteleconferencing\u201d products. The full extent of the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our longer-term operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of our control.\nOur business requires substantial investment and/or financing and there can be no assurance that such investment and/or financing will result in increased revenue or growth in our business.\nOur business requires substantial investment and there can be no assurance that such investment will result in increased revenue or growth in our business. Since our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d), we have obtained debt financing through our entry into our previous credit facility, issuances of convertible notes and issuances of senior\nsecured notes. Since the Transaction closed on December 1, 2020, we have not yet operated for a full fiscal quarter as a standalone business aviation provider and have not demonstrated an ability to generate positive cash flows. Our ability to do so will depend in large part on our ability to increase revenue and manage costs in our business.\nOur success may depend on our ability to raise additional financing on reasonable terms and on a timely basis. The amount and timing of our capital needs will depend in part on the extent of operating and capital expenditures required to broaden our service offerings and further develop and implement Gogo 5G and other components of our technology roadmap. In addition, we may actively consider from time to time other significant technological, strategic and operational initiatives. In order to execute on any of these initiatives, we may require additional financing.\nFurthermore, we expect that we will require additional financing to refinance, or repay at maturity, our indebtedness, including our 2022 Convertible Notes (as defined below) that mature on May 15, 2022, of which $237.8 million was outstanding at December 31, 2020. Conditions in the economy and the financial markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain necessary additional capital or financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is also limited by the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, as amended, and the ABL Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries would have been able to incur approximately $35 million of additional indebtedness, in the form of capital leases and borrowing under the ABL Credit Agreement. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Indebtedness-We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all.\u201d If we cannot secure sufficient additional financing, we will be forced to forego strategic opportunities or delay, scale back or eliminate additional service deployment, operations and investments or employ unplanned internal cost savings measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful at evaluating or pursuing strategic opportunities, which could adversely affect our revenue, operating results and financial condition.\nOur Board and management continuously assess whether shareholder value would be increased by engaging in strategic and/or financial relationships, transactions or other opportunities, including those that are suggested to us by third parties. There can be no assurance that we will pursue any strategic or financial relationship, transaction or other opportunity, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain. Further, the process of evaluating and pursuing any such relationship, transaction or other opportunity will involve the dedication of significant resources and the incurrence of significant costs and expenses. If we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks relating to assessing and undertaking strategic opportunities, it may disrupt our business or adversely impact our revenue, operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend upon third parties, many of which are single-source providers, to manufacture equipment components, provide services for our network and install and maintain our equipment.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for equipment components and services that we use to provide our services. Many suppliers of critical components of our equipment are single-source providers. Components for which we rely on single-source suppliers include, among others, the antennas and modems for all systems and the equipment used at our ATG cell site base stations. If we are required for any reason (including expiration of the contract, termination by one party for material breach or other termination events) to find one or more alternative suppliers, we estimate that the replacement process could take up to two years depending upon the component, and we may not be able to contract with such alternative suppliers on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Finding and contracting with suppliers of some components may be delayed or made more difficult by current suppliers\u2019 ownership of key intellectual property that requires alternative suppliers to either obtain rights to such intellectual property or develop new designs that do not infringe on such intellectual property. In addition, many of our components, such as the equipment used in our base stations, are highly integrated with other system components, which may further lengthen the time required for an alternative supplier to deliver a component that meets our system requirements. We also rely on third parties to provide the links between our data centers and our ground network. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services in sufficient quantities or\non a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe supply of third-party components and services could be interrupted or halted by a termination of our relationships, a failure of quality control or other operational problems at such suppliers or a significant decline in their financial condition. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may fail to recruit, train and retain the highly skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive and execute our growth strategy. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business.\nCompetition for key technical personnel in high-technology industries such as ours is intense. We believe that our future success depends in large part on our continued ability to hire, train, retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel needed to maintain and grow our ATG networks and related technology and develop and successfully deploy our technology roadmap and new wireless telecommunications products and technology. We may not be as successful as our competitors at recruiting, training, retaining and utilizing these highly skilled personnel. Any failure to recruit, train and retain highly skilled employees may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on the continued service and performance of our key personnel, including Oakleigh Thorne, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Such individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Gogo and its operations. As a result, if any of our key personnel were to leave Gogo, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss of productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and expertise. We do not maintain key man insurance on any of our officers or key employees. In addition, much of our key technology and systems is custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including key members of our management team, could disrupt our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdverse economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMacro-economic challenges are capable of creating volatile and unpredictable environments for doing business. We cannot predict the nature, extent, timing or likelihood of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of any economic recovery, worldwide, in the United States or in the aviation industry. A weaker business environment could lead to a decrease in air travel, cause owners and operators of business aircraft to cut costs by reducing their purchases or use of private aircraft or their use of in-flight Internet access on such aircraft or reduce the number of airline passengers on commercial aircraft to which we supply ATG network access, thus adversely affecting the revenue share payable by Intelsat to us under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement. Should an economic slowdown occur in the U.S. or globally, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of operating as a standalone business after the sale of our CA business.\nWe cannot be sure that the recent sale of the CA business will be successful in reducing our overall expenses and the expected efficiencies, benefits and cost savings of such a transaction and operating our business as a standalone business might be delayed or not realized. We expect to use the proceeds of the sale of our CA business to, among other things, reduce our net debt position and continue to invest in growth opportunities such as Gogo 5G. Such use of proceeds, however, may not ultimately have the desired result.\nUpon the closing of the Transaction, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement (the \u201cTSA\u201d) with Intelsat under which we and Intelsat agreed to, among other things, provide certain services to one another following the closing at negotiated prices for a period of up to one year. We are dependent upon Intelsat for certain resources essential to the day-to- day operation of our business. In addition, performance of our obligations to Intelsat under\nthe TSA may divert the attention of management and other employees from our day-to-day business and could disrupt our operations. If we are unable to manage the costs and the other risks associated with the TSA, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nMoreover, we now operate as a standalone business aviation connectivity provider and are smaller and less diversified, with a narrower business focus, and we may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions in the business aviation market. Additionally, the sale has reduced our ability to share certain costs across our businesses, such as the costs of operating as a public company, and may increase certain other operating costs, as we will no longer share suppliers and other business partners with the CA business. Upon the closing of the Transaction, we and Intelsat entered into the ATG Network Sharing Agreement, pursuant to which we provide certain inflight connectivity services on our ATG network to Intelsat, subject to certain revenue sharing obligations, and pursuant to which Intelsat has exclusive commercial aviation access to the ATG network in North America, subject to certain revenue guarantees. There can be no assurances that Intelsat will satisfy the revenue guarantees or maximize the revenues we could have generated if it did not have exclusive rights under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement. In addition, we and Intelsat have entered into a satellite network sharing agreement, pursuant to which Intelsat provides certain network services to us on their Ku-band and Ka-band satellite network. There can be no certainty that such agreement will provide us with sufficient network capacity or other benefits that we anticipate, or that it will remain in effect beyond the contemplated initial term. If we are unable to manage our cost structure and benefit from our ongoing relationship with Intelsat, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property\nWe may be unsuccessful or delayed in developing and deploying Gogo 5G or other next generation technologies.\nWe are currently developing a next generation ATG network using 5G technology and unlicensed spectrum. Gogo 5G will be capable of working with different spectrums and supporting different next generation technologies. There can be no assurance that we will launch Gogo 5G or any other next generation technology in sufficient time to meet growing user expectations regarding the in-flight connectivity experience and to effectively compete in the business aviation market, due to, among other things, risks associated with: (i) our failure to design and develop a technology that provides the features and performance we require; (ii) integrating the solution with our existing ATG network; (iii) the availability of adequate spectrum; (iv) the failure of spectrum to perform as expected; (v) the failure of equipment and software to perform as expected; (vi) problems arising in the manufacturing process; (vii) our ability to negotiate contracts with suppliers on acceptable commercial and other terms; (viii) our reliance on single-source suppliers for the development and manufacturing of the core elements of the network and on other suppliers to provide certain components and services; and (ix) delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals for installation and operation of such equipment and the provision of service to passengers. If Gogo 5G or any other next generation technology fails to perform as expected or its commercial availability is significantly delayed as compared to the timelines we establish, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent on the availability of spectrum.\nIn June 2006, we purchased at FCC auction an exclusive ten-year, 3 MHz license for ATG spectrum, and in April 2013, as part of our acquisition of LiveTV Airfone, LLC, we acquired an additional 1MHz ATG spectrum license. In 2017, our applications to renew our licenses were granted for additional ten-year terms without further payment. Any breach of the terms of our FCC licenses or FCC regulations including foreign ownership restrictions, permitted uses of the spectrum and compliance with FAA regulations could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of our licenses or a refusal by the FCC to renew the licenses upon expiration. Further, in connection with an application to renew our licenses upon expiration, a competitor could file a petition opposing such renewal on anti-competitive or other grounds. On August 3, 2017, the FCC released an order which, among other things, revised the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is currently not clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate\nwhen considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026. While we do not currently use this license, changes in technology may enable its use in our network in the future. An ambiguous renewal requirement could impair our flexibility to use or otherwise realize the value of such spectrum beyond 2026.\nOur ability to offer in-flight broadband Internet access through our ATG service currently depends on our ability to maintain rights to use the 3 MHz ATG spectrum in the U.S. and our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to meet increasing performance demands and expand our service offerings in the United States will depend in part upon our ability to successfully roll-out our plans to employ unlicensed spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band for concurrent use with the licensed 3 MHz spectrum and to launch Gogo 5G, and may likely require that we obtain additional licensed or unlicensed spectrum suitable for our use. Such spectrum may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain adequate spectrum could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional ATG spectrum, whether licensed or unlicensed, is or may become available in the United States or internationally in the future.\nWhile we have exclusive rights to the only broadband spectrum licensed by the FCC for ATG use and are currently the only provider of ATG service to business aircraft in the United States, the FCC may in the future decide to auction additional spectrum for ATG use that is not currently designated for that purpose, or a competitor could develop technology or a business plan that allows it to cost effectively use spectrum not specifically reserved for ATG, but on which ATG use is not prohibited, to provide broadband connectivity.\nThe availability of additional spectrum in the marketplace that is available for ATG use may increase the possibility that we may face competition from one or more other ATG service providers in the future. For example, a competitor has announced that it is developing a North American 4G ATG network using the same unlicensed spectrum that we intend to use in our Gogo 5G network.\nAdditionally, an in-flight connectivity provider has launched service on commercial aircraft in Europe using a hybrid air-to-ground/satellite network, and over time, we may face competition from that provider or ATG providers in other regions.\nWe could be adversely affected if we suffer service interruptions or delays, technology failures, damage to our equipment or system disruptions or failures arising from, among other things, force majeure events, cyber-attacks or other malicious activities.\nOur brand, reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers depend upon the reliable performance of our ground network and in-flight systems. We have experienced interruptions in these systems in the past, and we may experience service interruptions, service delays or technology or systems failures, which may be due to factors beyond our control. If we experience frequent system or network failures, our reputation, brand and customer retention could be harmed, and such failure could be material breaches of our customer contracts resulting in termination rights, penalties or claims for damages.\nOur operations and services depend upon the extent to which our equipment is protected against damage or interruption from fire, floods, earthquakes, tornados, power loss, solar flares, telecommunication failures, break-ins, acts of war or terrorism and similar events. The capacity, reliability and security of our network infrastructure are important to the operation of our business, which may suffer in the event of system disruptions or failures, such as computer hackings, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities. Our networks may be vulnerable to these attacks and unauthorized access.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries, including the wireless communications industry. We have faced, and may in the future face, claims that we or a supplier have violated patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Many companies, including our competitors, are devoting significant resources to obtaining patents that could potentially cover many aspects of our business. While we have reviewed the patent portfolios of certain competitors and other third parties, we have not exhaustively searched all patents relevant to our technologies and business and therefore it is possible that we may be unknowingly infringing the patents of others. Any infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious and whether or not they result in litigation, are time-consuming, divert technical and management personnel and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease providing certain products or services, adjust our merchandizing or marketing and advertising activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. Pursuant to our contracts with certain customers, we have agreed to indemnify such customers against such claims, and our indemnification obligations generally include defending or paying for the defense of the action and paying any judgments or other costs assessed against the customer in the event of an adverse outcome. In most cases, our contracts do not cap our indemnification obligations. In addition, certain of our suppliers do not indemnify us for third party infringement or misappropriation claims arising from our use of supplier technology, and we may be liable in the event of such claims. Our inability to meet our indemnification obligations and our customers terminating or failing to renew their contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe or our technology suppliers may be unable to continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to customers and passengers.\nThe market for our services is characterized by evolving technology, changes in customer and passenger needs and performance expectations, and frequent new service and product introductions. Our success will depend, in part, on our and our suppliers\u2019 ability to continue to enhance existing technology and services or develop new technology and services on a timely and cost-effective basis. If we or our suppliers fail to adapt quickly enough to changing technology, aviation partner and passenger requirements and/or regulatory requirements, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We expect to have to invest significant capital to keep pace with innovation and changing technology, and if the amount of such investment exceeds our plans or the amount of investment permitted under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or the ABL Credit Agreement, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAs is common in industries like ours, changing technology may result in obsolescence as we implement new technologies and products and retire old technologies and products. As we encounter such obsolescence, we need to ensure that we have a sufficient supply of parts, products and equipment compatible with our existing technology, as well as access to maintenance, repair and other critical support services, until the transition is completed. Certain suppliers may determine to stop manufacturing and supplying end-of-life parts, products and equipment, or may stop providing related services, prior to completion of our transition. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient inventory from existing suppliers we would be required to engage new suppliers who have access to the intellectual property required to manufacture and support components that meet our specifications, and we may not be able to contract with such suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We have implemented policies and procedures intended to ensure that we timely anticipate technology and product transitions and have access to sufficient inventory and services, but if such policies prove ineffective and we are unable to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business to effect a transition, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services in sufficient quantities or on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, following our retirement of end-of-life technologies and products, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand and might have to write off unusable inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, domain names and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements with our employees, vendors, customers and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought and obtained patent protection for certain of our technologies in the United States and certain other countries. Many of the trademarks that we use (including marks we have applied to register) contain words or terms having a somewhat common usage, such as \u201cGogo\u201d and \u201cGogo Vision\u201d and, as a result, we may have difficulty registering them in certain jurisdictions. We do not own, for example, the domain www.gogo.com and we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we do business or may do business in the future. If other companies have registered or have been using in commerce similar trademarks for services similar to ours in foreign jurisdictions, we may have difficulty in registering, or enforcing an exclusive right to use, our marks in those foreign jurisdictions.\nThere can be no assurance that the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be effective, that any patent and trademark applications will lead to issued patents and registered trademarks in all instances, that others will not obtain intellectual property rights to similar or superior technologies, products or services, or that our intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or infringed by others. Furthermore, the intellectual property laws and enforcement practices of other countries in which our service is or may in the future be offered may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use, our ability to exploit our proprietary technology or our brand image may be harmed, which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur use of open source software could limit our ability to commercialize our technology.\nOpen source software is software made widely and freely available to the public in human-readable source code form, usually with liberal rights to modify and improve such software. Some open source licenses require as a condition of use that proprietary software that is combined with licensed open source software and distributed must be released to the public in source code form and under the terms of the open source license. Accordingly, depending on the manner in which such licenses were interpreted and applied, we could face restrictions on our ability to commercialize certain of our products and we could be required to: (i) release the source code of certain of our proprietary software to the public, including competitors, if the open source software was linked in a manner that would require such release of our proprietary software source code; (ii) seek licenses from third parties for replacement software; and/or (iii) re-engineer our software in order to continue offering our products. Such consequences may materially adversely affect our business.\nThe failure of our equipment or material defects or errors in our software may damage our reputation, result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages, and impair our ability to sell our service.\nOur products contain complex systems, components and software that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology or when new software is first introduced or new versions or enhancements are released. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. In addition, such events could result in significant expenses and diversion of development and other resources, a reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of our products and services, loss of existing customers, terminations of, failures to renew, penalties or damage claims under aviation partner contracts, harm to our reputation and brand image and increased insurance costs. If our in-flight system has a malfunction resulting from an error or defect or a problem with installation or maintenance and such malfunction causes physical damage to an aircraft or impairs its on-board electronics or avionics, significant property loss and serious personal injury or death could result. Any such failure could expose us to substantial personal injury claims, product liability claims or costly repair obligations. The aircraft operated by our customers may be very costly to repair and the damages in any product liability claims could be material. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms; however, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover claims. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we indemnify\nsome of our customers for losses due to third-party claims and in certain cases the causes of such losses may include failure of our products. Should we be required by the FAA or otherwise to cease providing the Gogo service, even on a temporary basis, as a result of a product malfunction or defect, our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Litigation and Regulation\nIf we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons, we could lose our FCC license.\nUnder the Communications Act and applicable FCC regulations, we are effectively restricted from having more than 25% of our capital stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons, including individuals and entities organized outside the United States or controlled by non-U.S. persons. We have established procedures to ascertain the nature and extent of our foreign ownership, and we believe that the indirect ownership of our equity by foreign persons or entities is below the 25% cap. However, as a publicly traded company we may not be able to determine with certainty the exact amount of our stock that is held by foreign persons or entities at any given time. A failure to comply with applicable restrictions on ownership by non-U.S. persons could result in an order to divest the offending ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or spectrum license revocation proceedings, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulation by United States and foreign government agencies, including the FCC, which issued our exclusive ATG spectrum license, and the FAA, which regulates the civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries in the United States, may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services.\nAny breach of the terms of our ATG spectrum licenses or other licenses and authorizations obtained by us from time to time, or any violation of the Communications Act or the FCC\u2019s rules, could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of a license or the imposition of fines. From time to time, the FCC may monitor or audit compliance with the Communications Act and the FCC\u2019s rules or with our licenses, including if a third party were to bring a claim of breach or noncompliance. In addition, the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, may be amended in the future in a manner that could be adverse to us.\nAs discussed in more detail in the section entitled \u201cBusiness-Licenses and Regulation-Federal Aviation Administration,\u201d FAA approvals required to operate our business include STCs and Parts Manufacturing Authority (PMA). While our distribution partners are responsible for obtaining STCs, obtaining PMAs is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. Prior to installation of our equipment, any inability to obtain, delay in obtaining (including as a result of a government shutdown or funding shortages), or change in, needed FAA certifications, authorizations, or approvals, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our installation commitments, manufacture and sell parts for installation on aircraft, or expand our business. Following installation of our equipment, if we were to discover that our equipment or components of our equipment were not in compliance with specifications on which the STC authorizing installation was based, or if the FAA\u2019s requirements changed, our non-compliance could result in our incurring material costs to inspect and in some circumstances modify or replace such equipment, and could in rare circumstances result in our system being turned off or installed aircraft being grounded. If we fail to comply with the FAA\u2019s many regulations and standards that apply to our activities, we could lose the FAA certifications, authorizations, or other approvals on which our manufacturing, installation, maintenance, preventive maintenance, and alteration capabilities are based. In addition, from time to time, the FAA or comparable foreign agencies adopt new regulations or amend existing regulations. The FAA could also change its policies regarding the delegation of inspection and certification responsibilities to private companies, which could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such new regulations or amendments to existing regulations or policies apply to our activities, our compliance costs would likely increase.\nAs a broadband Internet provider, we must comply with CALEA, which requires communications carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities and services can accommodate certain technical capabilities in executing authorized wiretapping and other electronic surveillance. Currently, our CALEA solution is fully deployed in our network. However, we could be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC or law enforcement agencies for any delays in complying or failure to comply with, CALEA, or similar obligations. Such enforcement actions could subject us to fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties, all of which may materially adversely affect our\nbusiness and financial condition. Further, to the extent the FCC adopts additional capability requirements applicable to broadband Internet providers, its decision may increase the costs we incur to comply with such regulations.\nWe are also subject to regulation by certain foreign laws and regulatory bodies, including Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, which issued our exclusive Canadian ATG subordinate spectrum license and regulates our use of the spectrum licensed to us.\nAdverse decisions or regulations of these U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are unable to predict the impact of regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted by the various governmental entities that oversee portions of our business.\nOur possession and use of personal information present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to costly litigation and damage our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we or our third-party providers collect, process and store sensitive data, including personal information of aircraft passengers and our employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information (and other sensitive data such as our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers) is critical to our operations and business strategy. We depend on the security of our networks and, in part, on the security of the network infrastructures of our third-party providers of telecommunications, cloud computing, customer support and other vendors. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or compromised due to employee error, malfeasance, hardware or software defects or other disruptions. Further, our in-cabin network operates as an open, unsecured Wi-Fi hotspot, and non-encrypted transmissions users send over this network may be vulnerable to access by other users on the same plane. Unauthorized use of our, or our third-party service providers\u2019, networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including personal information of passengers using our service. Data security threats are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. There can be no assurance that any security measures we, or third parties, take will be effective in preventing these activities, given the constantly changing nature of the threats. Any such security incidents, unauthorized access or disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under our contracts with certain customers, which generally require us to indemnify the customer for passenger and other third-party claims arising from data security breaches. In addition, such incidents may disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to protect confidential user data or to provide users with adequate notice of our privacy policies could also subject us to investigations and regulatory penalties imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies, non-U.S. regulatory agencies or courts. For example, the FTC could assert jurisdiction to impose penalties if it found our privacy policies or security measures to be inadequate under existing federal law. We could also be subject to certain state laws, including so-called \u201cmini-FTC Acts\u201d, that impose data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, or other consumer privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these rules or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also must comply with certain Communications Act and FCC privacy and data security rules for our voice services, including certain provisions applicable to customer proprietary network information. Our failure to comply with these requirements may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther countries in which we may operate or from which our services may be offered, including those in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), also have certain privacy and data security requirements that may apply to our business, either now or in the future. These countries\u2019 laws may in some cases be more stringent than the requirements in the United States. For example, European Union member countries have specific requirements relating to cross-border transfers of personal information to certain jurisdictions, including to the United States. In addition, some countries have stricter consumer notice and/or consent requirements relating to personal information collection, use or\nsharing. Moreover, international privacy and data security regulations have become more complex. In May 2018, the GDPR took effect, which has imposed even more restrictive privacy-related requirements. Despite the substantial preparation and related expenditures that we undertook to be in compliance with the GDPR as of its effective date, there can be no assurance that we are or will continue to be in compliance. The regulation of data privacy and security in the EU and in other jurisdictions continues to evolve, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate effect of evolving regulation and implementation over time. EU member states also have some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter requirements for certain data processing activities.\nCertain states have also enacted specific privacy laws to which we may be subject. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) took effect January 1, 2020 and provides broad new privacy rights for California consumers, including, among others, the right to obtain copies of their personal information collected in the past 12 months, the ability to opt out from the sale of personal information, and the right to demand deletion of personal information. The CCPA also imposes compliance requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from consumers, including, among others, notice, consent, and service provider requirements. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The California Office of the Attorney General has published final regulations to implement portions of the CCPA. In addition, in November 2020 California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) ballot initiative, which introduces significant amendments to the CCPA. The CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and new regulations are expected to be introduced. Depending on such regulations, the measures we are required to take to comply with the CCPA may be significantly impacted.\nOur failure to comply with GDPR, CCPA or other privacy or data security-related laws, rules or regulations imposed by U.S. federal or state governments or agencies or foreign governments or agencies could result in material penalties imposed by regulators or cause us to be in material breach under our airline agreements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be sure that a regulator would deem our security measures to be appropriate given the lack of prescriptive measures in certain data protection laws. Without more specific guidance, we cannot know whether our chosen security safeguards are adequate according to each applicable data protection law. Given the evolving nature of security threats and evolving safeguards, we cannot be sure that our chosen security safeguards will protect against security threats to our business. Even security measures that are appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to fully protect our or our partners\u2019 information technology systems and the data contained in those systems. Moreover, interpretations or changes to new or existing data protection laws may impose on us responsibility for our employees and third parties that assist with aspects of our data processing. As a result, our employees\u2019 or third parties\u2019 intentional, unintentional, or inadvertent actions may increase our vulnerability or expose us to security threats, such as phishing attacks, and we may remain responsible for a successful phishing attack despite the quality and otherwise legal sufficiency of our security measures.\nExpenses or liabilities resulting from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGogo Inc. and Intelsat, as well as certain of Intelsat\u2019s airline partners, are currently defendants in a patent infringement lawsuit initially filed when we owned the CA business. In addition, Gogo Inc. and certain of our current and former executives are defendants in a securities class action lawsuit, and we are a nominal defendant, and members of our board of directors and certain current and former executives are defendants, in a related stockholder derivative lawsuit. We are required to indemnify the directors and current and former officers who are defendants in the class action and derivative lawsuits for their defense costs and any judgments resulting from such suits. In the future, we may be subject to additional securities class action or derivative litigation. From time to time, we may also be subject to other claims or litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including for example, claims related to employment matters. Our operations are characterized by the use of new technologies and services across multiple jurisdictions that implicate various statutes and a range of rules and regulations that may be subject to broad or creative interpretation. This may result in litigation, including class action lawsuits, the outcome of which may be difficult to assess or quantify due to the potential ambiguity inherent in these regulatory schemes and/or the nascence of our technologies and services. Plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate\namounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Any such claims or litigation may be time-consuming and costly, divert management resources, require us to change our products and services, or require us to pay significant monetary damages, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce our existing contracts and, even if successful, may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, litigation by or against any customer or supplier could have the effect of negatively impacting our reputation and goodwill with existing and potential customers and suppliers.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals force us to incur additional expenses and may make our supply chain more complex.\nWe are subject to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which requires us to diligence, disclose and report whether or not our products contain certain minerals and metals, known as \u201cconflict minerals.\u201d These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of certain of the materials used in the manufacture of components in our products and equipment. In addition, we have and will continue to incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe and our subsidiaries have substantial debt and may incur substantial additional debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial health, reduce our profitability, limit our ability to obtain financing in the future and pursue certain business opportunities and reduce the value of your investment.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $1.2 billion, including $975.0 million outstanding of our 9.875% senior secured notes due 2024 (the \u201c2024 Senior Secured Notes\u201d), and $237.8 million outstanding of our 6.00% convertible senior notes due 2022 (the \u201c2022 Convertible Notes\u201d). Subject to certain limitations set forth in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, as amended, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt in the future, including up to $30.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability (and including letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities) under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL Credit Facility\u201d) pursuant to the credit agreement, dated as of August 26, 2019 (the \u201cABL Credit Agreement\u201d), which could increase the risks described below and lead to other risks. The amount of our debt or such other obligations could have important consequences for holders of our common stock, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is limited, and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness may be impaired in the future;\n\u2022\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and which, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns;\n\u2022\nour ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase;\n\u2022\nour ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing may be impaired in the future;\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nour flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and our ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from making capital investments that are necessary or important to our operations in general, growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins of our business units.\nWe may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe have from time to time evaluated, and we continue to evaluate, our potential capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, limitations on bandwidth capacity and performance and generally evolving technology in our industry. We may utilize one or more types of capital raising in order to fund any initiative in this regard, including the issuance of new equity securities and new debt securities, including debt securities convertible into our common stock. Since our IPO, we have obtained debt financing through our entry into our previous credit facility, issuances of convertible notes and issuances of senior secured notes. Since the Transaction closed on December 1, 2020, we have not completed a full fiscal quarter of operation as a standalone business aviation provider, and we have not demonstrated an ability to generate positive cash flows. Our ability to do so will depend in large part on our ability to increase revenue and manage costs in our business. In addition, our ability to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and the extent and timing of certain capital and other necessary expenditures are subject to numerous variables, such as costs related to execution of our current technology roadmap, including continuing development and deployment of Gogo 5G and other future technologies. The market conditions and the macroeconomic conditions that affect the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on acceptable terms, if at all. We may be unable to secure additional financing on favorable terms or at all or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes, the ABL Credit Agreement and other indebtedness outstanding from time to time.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is limited by the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining permitted indebtedness for Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo Inc.) and its subsidiaries was approximately $35 million in the form of capital leases and borrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement. In the future, if our subsidiaries are in compliance with certain incurrence ratios set forth in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and in the ABL Credit Agreement, our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness. Neither the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes nor the ABL Credit Agreement prohibits Gogo Inc. from incurring additional indebtedness under any circumstances, but they do limit the amount of cash that our subsidiaries may dividend, transfer or otherwise distribute to us, including cash distributed to us to pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes or to pay interest on other indebtedness incurred by us, including indebtedness or preferred stock incurred to refinance, replace, renew or refund the 2022 Convertible Notes.\nThe terms of any additional financing may further limit our financial and operating flexibility. Our ability to satisfy our financial obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, if financing is not available when needed, or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, we may be required to use the proceeds from any such financing to repay a portion of our outstanding debt.\nIf we raise additional funds or seek to reduce our current levels of indebtedness through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company. In addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and we may grant holders of such securities rights with respect to the governance and operations of our business. If we are unable to obtain\nadequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities on desirable terms or at all, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, which could result in a default on existing indebtedness or future indebtedness.\nWe cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, particularly because of our high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the agreements and instruments governing our debt. In addition, we do not currently have a revolving credit facility under which we can borrow to make payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance any indebtedness. In the absence of such sources of capital, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement restrict our ability to dispose of assets and how we use the proceeds from any such dispositions. In particular, the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes provides that if we complete certain sales or transfers of assets, we are required to apply the Net Cash Proceeds (as defined in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes) generated therefrom within 365 days to either permanently repay indebtedness or invest in property or non-current assets of a nature or type used in our or a similar or related business. If we do not so apply the Net Cash Proceeds from the Transaction by December 1, 2021, we will be required to offer to repurchase for cash an aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Secured Notes equal to any Net Cash Proceeds not so applied as of such date, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the repurchase date. Our inability to utilize the Net Cash Proceeds from the Transaction or other dispositions for other purposes, such as to pay for general operating expenses, may negatively impact our business or financial condition.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business.\nThe indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of our subsidiaries and, in certain circumstances, us to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with other companies; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions\nbeyond our control. Our failure to comply with obligations under the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under such agreements and instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. All of these covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business, may limit our ability in the future to satisfy currently outstanding obligations and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nAdditionally, any indebtedness under our ABL Credit Agreement will bear interest at variable rates that use the London inter-bank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop encouraging or compelling banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021 (the \u201cFCA Announcement\u201d). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021 and, based on the foregoing, it appears likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified before the end of 2021. In 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR publication, issued a consultation requesting feedback on its intention to continue publication of overnight and one-, three-, six- and 12-month USD LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023 (\u201cIBA Announcement\u201d). There were concurrent announcements by the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, U.S. bank regulators, the Federal Reserve Board and the Alternative Reference Rates Committee supporting the IBA Announcement and, among other things, encouraging banks to stop entering into new LIBOR-based contracts by the end of 2021. It is not possible to predict the effect the FCA Announcement, the IBA Announcement, any discontinuation, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on LIBOR. Furthermore, the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could increase the interest rates payable under our current and/or future indebtedness bearing interest at variable rates.\nThe 2024 Senior Secured Notes, and any indebtedness under the ABL Credit Facility, are secured by substantially all of our assets. As a result of these security interests, such assets would only be available to satisfy claims of our general creditors or to holders of our equity securities if we were to become insolvent to the extent the value of such assets exceeded the amount of our secured indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, the existence of these security interests may adversely affect our financial flexibility.\nThe 2024 Senior Secured Notes, and any indebtedness under the ABL Credit Facility, are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, if an event of default were to occur under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement, the holders of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent amounts were outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility, the lenders party to the ABL Credit Agreement would have a prior right to our assets, to the exclusion of our general creditors in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization. In that event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement, resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of our unsecured indebtedness. Only after satisfying the claims of our unsecured creditors and our subsidiaries\u2019 unsecured creditors would any amount be available for our equity holders. The pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged under these financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes, to repay the 2022 Convertible Notes at maturity or to purchase the 2022 Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, and the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement may limit our ability to pay interest, or dividends, on indebtedness, or preferred stock, issued to refinance the 2022 Convertible Notes.\nHolders of the 2022 Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their 2022 Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change purchase date. In addition, in the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the 2022\nConvertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. The 2020 Convertible Notes became eligible for conversion at the election of holders on October 1, 2020 and are currently convertible until at least March 31, 2021. Upon conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2022 Convertible Notes being converted, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share). Moreover, we will be required to repay the 2022 Convertible Notes in cash on May 15, 2022, their maturity date, unless earlier converted or repurchased. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of 2022 Convertible Notes surrendered therefor or repay the 2022 Convertible Notes at maturity or upon 2022 Convertible Notes being converted. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement also does not allow our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us for the payment of the principal of the 2022 Convertible Notes. In addition, the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement limits the amount of cash our subsidiaries may dividend, transfer or otherwise distribute to us, including cash distributed to pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes or to pay any interest on other indebtedness incurred by us, including indebtedness or preferred stock incurred to refinance, replace, renew or refund the 2022 Convertible Notes, which may limit our ability to issue debt or other securities in an amount necessary to refinance the outstanding 2022 Convertible Notes or at rates that such distributions could support. While we have reserved a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes to fund a portion of future interest payments on the 2022 Convertible Notes, the amount of such funds, together with funds up-streamed from subsidiaries and from other potential sources of liquidity (if any) may not be adequate to fund any future liquidity shortfall. See \u201c-We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all.\u201d\nOur failure to purchase 2022 Convertible Notes as required by the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes or to pay cash payable upon future conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes as required by the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes would constitute a default under the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes. A default under the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under the agreements and instruments governing our other indebtedness and the acceleration of amounts outstanding thereunder, including the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the 2022 Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. A default under the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent.\nA downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us, our subsidiaries or our indebtedness, if any, could cause our cost of capital to increase.\nThe 2024 Senior Secured Notes have been rated by nationally recognized rating agencies and may in the future be rated by additional rating agencies. We cannot assure you that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. Any future lowering of ratings may make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our IPO, which occurred on June 21, 2013 and in which shares of common stock were sold at a price of $17.00 per share. From the IPO date through March 4, 2021, the price of our common stock has ranged from a closing low of $1.40 per share to a closing high of $34.34 per share. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. They include:\n\u2022\naviation industry or general market conditions, including those related to the impact of COVID-19 on restrictions on and demand for air travel, as well as disruptions to supply chains and installations;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in technology or customer usage of Wi-Fi and Internet broadband services;\n\u2022\nany inability to timely and efficiently roll out Gogo 5G or other components of our technology roadmap;\n\u2022\nuncertainties and consequences arising from the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union, including any financial, trade, tax and legal implications;\n\u2022\nnew regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and any inability to generate positive cash flows on a consolidated basis in the future or to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nchanges in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022\naction by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders, including future sales;\n\u2022\nshort-selling or other transactions involving derivatives of our securities;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of us and our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products, contracts, contract amendments, acquisitions or strategic partnerships;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including increases or decreases in litigation expenses associated with intellectual property lawsuits we may initiate, or in which we may be named as defendants;\n\u2022\nfailure to complete significant sales;\n\u2022\nany future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nrenewal of our FCC license and our ability to obtain additional spectrum; and\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many such companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against such company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdjustments by holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes of their hedging positions in our common stock and the forward stock purchase transactions, or any modifications of the forward stock purchase transactions, may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAny buying or selling of shares of our common stock by holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes to establish or adjust hedged positions with respect to our common stock may affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2022 Convertible Notes may also encourage short selling by market participants because any conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes could depress our common stock price. The price of our common stock could be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the 2022 Convertible\nNotes as a more attractive means of equity participation, and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity, which we expect to occur involving our common stock.\nOn December 11, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated privately negotiated prepaid forward stock purchase transaction (the \u201cAmended and Restated Forward Transaction\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the \u201cForward Counterparty\u201d), which replaced the prepaid forward stock purchase transaction entered into with the Forward Counterparty in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes. The Amended and Restated Forward Transaction is generally expected to facilitate privately negotiated derivative transactions, including swaps, between the Forward Counterparty and investors in the 2022 Convertible Notes relating to shares of our common stock by which investors in the 2022 Convertible Notes will establish short positions relating to shares of our common stock and otherwise hedge their investments in the 2022 Convertible Notes. The maturity date of such Amended and Restated Forward Transaction is on or around May 15, 2022, the maturity date for the 2022 Convertible Notes. Such investors may enter into other transactions in connection with or in addition to such derivative transactions, including the purchase or sale of shares of our common stock. As a result of the existence of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction, such derivative transactions and any related market activity could cause more purchases or sales of shares of our common stock over the term of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction than there otherwise would have been had we not entered into the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction. Such purchases or sales, including sales made in connection with any refinancing or repurchase of our 2022 Convertible Notes, could potentially increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) or decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. In addition, in connection with any repurchase of our 2022 Convertible Notes, the Forward Counterparty may elect to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction early in accordance with its terms, which would result in a delivery of shares of our common stock to us earlier than the maturity date described above.\nIn addition, we may request that the Forward Counterparty modify the settlement terms of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction to provide that, in lieu of the delivery of the number of shares of our common stock to us to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction in accordance with its terms, the Forward Counterparty would pay to us the net proceeds from the sale by the Forward Counterparty (or its affiliate) of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in a registered offering (which may include block sales, sales on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), sales in the over-the-counter market, sales pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices). Any such sales could potentially decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. The Forward Counterparty is not required to effect any such settlement in cash in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock and, if we request for the Forward Counterparty to effect any such settlement, it will be entered into in the discretion of the Forward Counterparty on such terms as we may agree with the Forward Counterparty at the time.\nAdditionally, the Forward Counterparty (or its affiliates) is likely to modify its hedge positions in respect of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock and/or by purchasing the shares of common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction (and are likely to do so during the final valuation period under the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction and on or around any election by the Forward Counterparty to settle all of a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction early). The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nThe Forward Counterparty is a financial institution, and we will be subject to the risk that it might default under the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Forward Counterparty is not secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the recent past resulted in, and may again result in, the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If the Forward Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with the Forward Counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the Forward Counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock.\nFuture stock issuances could cause substantial dilution and a decline in our stock price.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangement, as consideration to third party service or equipment providers or otherwise. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes. The conversion of some or all of the 2022 Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion. The 2020 Convertible Notes are currently convertible at the election of holders and, to date, approximately $1.0 million of 2020 Convertible Notes have been converted into shares of common stock. We may issue additional shares of common stock upon any conversion or exchange of 2020 Convertible Notes pursuant to their terms or otherwise. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or exchange could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2022 Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nAdditional shares of common stock are also issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, including those subject to our option exchange program, which closed on June 12, 2020, that resulted in a reduction in the applicable exercise price of such options. We may also reserve additional shares of our common stock for issuance upon the exercise of stock options or other similar forms of equity incentives. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nOur President and CEO is a significant stockholder and could exert influence over our company, and if the ownership of our common stock continues to be concentrated, or becomes more concentrated in the future, it could prevent our other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Oakleigh Thorne, our President and CEO and the Chairman of our Board of Directors, and the entities affiliated with Mr. Thorne (the \u201cThorne Entities\u201d) beneficially owned approximately 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Thorne is able to exercise influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval for the foreseeable future, including approval of significant corporate transactions and the election of directors. Such ability to influence may reduce the market price of our common stock.\nAs our President and CEO, Mr. Thorne has control over our day-to-day management and the implementation of major strategic initiatives and investments by our company, subject to authorization and oversight by our Board of Directors. As a member of our Board of Directors, Mr. Thorne owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, Mr. Thorne is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control, in his own interest, which may not always be in the interests of stockholders generally.\nOur corporate governance guidelines address potential conflicts between a director\u2019s interests and our interests, and our code of business conduct, among other things, requires our employees and directors to avoid actions or relationships that might conflict or appear to conflict with their job responsibilities or our interests and to disclose their outside activities, financial interests or relationships that may present a possible conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict to management or corporate counsel. These corporate governance guidelines and code of business ethics do not, by themselves, prohibit transactions with the Thorne Entities.\nFulfilling our obligations associated with being a public company is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price.\nAs a public company, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as NASDAQ rules, require us to implement various corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and complex accounting rules. Compliance with these public\ncompany obligations requires us to devote significant time and resources and places significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. We are also required under Sarbanes-Oxley to document and test the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required under the Exchange Act to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Our ability to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls will depend, in part, on our ability to transition responsibility for certain internal control processes from personnel whom we no longer employ following the Transaction to our employees. Any failure to maintain effective controls or implement required new or improved controls may materially adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Failure to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, NASDAQ, or other regulatory authorities.\nThe utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $647 million in federal and $452 million in state NOLs. These deferred tax assets are currently fully reserved. The federal NOLs begin to expire in 2031. The state NOLs expire in various tax years and began to expire in 2016. Under Section 382 of the Code and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as an increase of more than 50% of the value of the Company\u2019s stock owned by certain \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Code, in its equity ownership over a rolling three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited.\nIn September 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a Section 382 Rights Agreement (the \u201cRights Agreement\u201d), between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent, and declared a dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company outstanding on the record date of October 2, 2020, to the stockholders of record on that date. The Rights Agreement is designed to facilitate the Company\u2019s ability to protect its NOLs and certain other tax attributes in order to be able to offset potential future income taxes for federal income tax purposes. The Rights Agreement may make it more difficult for the Company to undergo an ownership change by deterring a third party from acquiring 4.9% or more of the shares of our common stock. This may adversely affect the marketability of our common stock by discouraging any individual, firm, corporation, partnership or other person or group of affiliated or associated persons from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more shares of our common stock then outstanding. In addition, although the Rights Agreement is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect utilization of our NOLs, there is no assurance that the Rights Agreement will prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our common stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement, our Board of Directors may determine that it is in the best interests of the Company to exempt certain transactions, that could result in an ownership change, from triggering the Rights Agreement. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our NOLs is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, and certain provisions in our existing and any future credit facility could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nAuthorization of the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nEstablishment of a classified Board of Directors, as a result of which our board will be divided into three classes, with each class serving for staggered three-year terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new Board of Directors at an annual meeting;\n\u2022\nA requirement that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a supermajority stockholder vote;\n\u2022\nA provision that vacancies on the Board of Directors, including newly-created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nA limitation on who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nA prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and\n\u2022\nA requirement of supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.\nAdditionally, our Board of Directors adopted the Rights Agreement, which is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code by deterring a third party from acquiring 4.9% or more of our shares of common stock then outstanding. The Rights Agreement, as well as the provisions described above, may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of the Rights Agreement or such provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nThe Rights Agreement as well as the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management or Board of Directors. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nThe terms of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the 2022 Convertible Notes require our subsidiaries or us, respectively, to repurchase the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or the 2022 Convertible Notes, respectively, in the event of a change of control. A takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the 2022 Convertible Notes to require our subsidiaries or us, respectively, to repurchase the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or the 2022 Convertible Notes, respectively. In addition, under the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement, a takeover of our company would allow the administrative agent and/or the lenders to terminate their commitments under the ABL Credit Agreement and declare any and all outstanding amounts to be due and payable. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur corporate charter and bylaws include provisions limiting ownership by non-U.S. citizens, including the power of our Board of Directors to redeem shares of our common stock from non-U.S. citizens.\nThe Communications Act and FCC regulations impose restrictions on foreign ownership of FCC licensees, as described in the above risk factor, \u201c-Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property-If we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons we could lose our FCC license.\u201d Our corporate charter and bylaws include provisions that\npermit our Board of Directors to take certain actions in order to comply with FCC regulations regarding foreign ownership, including but not limited to, a right to redeem shares of common stock from non-U.S. citizens at prices at or below fair market value. Non-U.S. citizens should consider carefully the redemption provisions in our certificate of incorporation prior to investing in our common stock.\nThese restrictions may also decrease the liquidity and value of our stock by reducing the pool of potential investors in our company and making the acquisition of control of us by third parties more difficult. In addition, these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to attract equity financing or consummate an acquisition of a foreign entity using shares of our capital stock.", "PERMNO": 13956, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "GOGO"}
