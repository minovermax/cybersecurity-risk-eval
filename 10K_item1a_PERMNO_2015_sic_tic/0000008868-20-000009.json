RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information in our 2019 Annual Report. Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur, our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to the Transaction\nNow that the Transaction has been consummated, the expected benefits from integrating our operations with Natura & Co's operations may not be achieved.\nThe success of the Transaction depends, in part, on the ability of Natura &Co and its subsidiaries and businesses other than Avon (including Natura Cosmeticos, Aesop, The Body Shop and their respective subsidiaries) and Avon to realize the expected benefits from integrating their respective operations. No assurance can be given that Natura &Co and Avon will be able to integrate their respective operations without encountering difficulties, which may include, among other things, the loss of key employees, diversion of management attention, the disruption of our respective ongoing businesses or possible inconsistencies in standards, procedures and policies. Additionally, Natura &Co and Avon may be required to make unanticipated capital expenditures or investments in order to maintain, integrate, improve or sustain our operations. Integrating our respective operations may involve additional unanticipated costs and financial risks, such as the incurrence of unexpected write-offs, the possible effect of adverse tax and accounting treatments and unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to Natura &Co or Avon. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Transaction.\nEven if our respective operations are successfully integrated, we may not realize the full benefits of the Transaction, including the synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities, within the expected time frame, if at all. Natura &Co and Avon continue to evaluate the estimates of synergies to be realized from, and the fair value accounting allocations associated with, the Transaction. However, the actual cost savings, the costs required to realize the cost savings and the source of the cost savings could differ materially from the estimates of Natura &Co and Avon.\nFurther, Natura &Co and Avon may not achieve the targeted operating or long-term strategic benefits of the Transaction. In addition, Natura &Co and Avon may not accelerate growth by increasing investments in digital, product innovation and brand initiatives. If Natura &Co and Avon are unable to achieve the objectives, or are not able to achieve our objectives on a timely basis, the anticipated benefits of the Transaction may not be realized fully or at all. An inability to realize the full extent of, or\nany of, the anticipated benefits of the Transaction could have an adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Natura &Co and Avon and could limit Natura &Co\u2019s and Avon\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transaction.\nThird parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with us as a result of the Transaction.\nWe have contracts with customers, employees, Representatives, suppliers, vendors, distributors, landlords, lenders, licensors, joint venture partners and other business partners, and these contracts may require us to obtain consent from these other parties in connection with the Transaction. As not all such consents have been obtained, the counterparties to these contracts may seek to terminate or otherwise materially adversely alter the terms of such contracts following the Transaction, which in turn may result in us suffering a loss of potential future revenue, incurring contractual liabilities or losing rights that are material to our business. Further, parties with which we have business and operational relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties.\nIn addition, current and prospective employees and Representatives may experience uncertainty about their roles now that the Transaction has been consummated and such uncertainty may have an effect on our corporate culture. There can be no assurance we will be able to attract and retain key talent, including senior leaders, to the same extent that we have previously been able to attract and retain employees and sales representatives. Any loss or distraction of our customers, employees, Representatives, suppliers, vendors, distributors, landlords, lenders, licensors, joint venture partners and other business partners, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows and could limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transaction.\nThe consummation of the Transaction limits our ability to utilize existing US tax credits and also could be further reduced pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Code if an additional ownership change occurs in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $660 million of foreign tax and other credits available to offset future income for U.S. federal tax purposes. As a result of the ownership change resulting from the Transaction the ability to use these credits may be limited to a range of approximately $108 to $178 million. Our ability to utilize such credits to offset future income could be limited, however, if the Company undergoes an additional \"ownership change\" within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in ownership of our stock by 5% shareholders (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. If the 50 percentage points are exceeded, Section 382 establishes an annual limitation on the amount of deferred tax assets attributable to previously incurred credits that may be used to offset taxable income in future years. A number of complex rules apply in calculating this limitation, and any such limitation would depend in part on the market value of the Company at the time of the ownership change and prevailing interest rates at the time of calculation. As a result, the magnitude of any potential limitation on the use of our deferred tax assets and the effect of such limitation on the Company if an ownership change were to occur is difficult to assess. However, if all or a portion of our deferred tax assets were to become subject to this limitation, our tax liability could increase significantly and our future results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Prospectively if we were to undergo a further ownership change these remaining credits could be further reduced.\nRisks Related to Us and Our Business\nOur success depends on our ability to improve our financial and operational performance and execute fully our global business strategy.\nOur ability to improve our financial and operational performance and implement the key initiatives of our global business strategy is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022implement Open Up Avon, stabilization strategies, cost savings initiatives, restructuring and other initiatives, and achieve anticipated savings and benefits from such programs and initiatives;\n\u2022reverse declines in our market share and strengthen our brand image;\n\u2022implement appropriate pricing strategies and product mix that are more aligned with the preferences of local markets and achieve anticipated benefits from these strategies;\n\u2022reduce costs and effectively manage our cost structure, particularly selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses;\n\u2022improve our business in the markets where we operate, including through improving field health;\n\u2022execute investments in information technology (\"IT\") infrastructure and realize efficiencies across our supply chain, marketing processes, sales model and organizational structure;\n\u2022implement and continue to innovate our digital strategies, Internet platform, technology strategies and customer service initiatives, including our ability to offer a more compelling social selling experience and the roll-out of e-commerce in certain markets;\n\u2022effectively manage our outsourcing activities;\n\u2022improve our marketing and advertising, including our brochures and our social media presence;\n\u2022improve working capital, effectively manage inventory and implement initiatives to reduce inventory levels, including through our recent structural reset of inventory processes, and the potential impact on cash flows and obsolescence;\n\u2022secure financing at attractive rates, maintain appropriate capital investment, capital structure and cash flow levels and implement cash management, tax, foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies;\n\u2022reverse declines in Active Representatives and Representative satisfaction by successfully reducing campaign complexity and enhancing our sales leadership program, the Representative experience, retention and earnings potential, along with improving our brand image;\n\u2022increase the productivity of Representatives through successful implementation of segmentation, field activation programs and technology tools and enablers and other investments in the direct-selling channel;\n\u2022improve management of our businesses in developing markets, including improving local IT resources and management of local supply chains;\n\u2022increase the number of consumers served per Representative and their engagement online, as well as to reach new consumers through a combination of new brands, new businesses, new channels and pursuit of strategic opportunities such as joint ventures and alliances with other companies; and\n\u2022estimate and achieve any financial projections concerning, for example, customer demand, future revenue, profit, cash flow, and operating margin increases and maintain an effective internal control environment as a result of any challenges associated with the implementation of our various plans, strategies and initiatives.\nThere can be no assurance if and when any of these initiatives will be successfully and fully executed or completed.\nWe may experience financial and strategic difficulties and delays or unexpected costs in completing Open Up Avon and any other restructuring and cost-savings initiatives, including achieving any anticipated savings and benefits of these initiatives.\nIn September 2018, we initiated Open Up Avon. As one element of this plan, we are targeting cost savings, to be generated from efficiencies in manufacturing and sourcing, distribution, general and administrative activities, and back office functions, as well as through revenue management, interest and tax. These savings are expected to be achieved through restructuring actions (that may result in charges related to severance, contract terminations and inventory and other asset write-offs), as well as other cost-savings strategies that would not result in restructuring charges. We initiated the Open Up Avon strategy to enable us to achieve our goals of low-single-digit constant-dollar revenue growth and low double-digit operating margin by 2021. We plan to reinvest a portion of these cost savings in commercial initiatives, including training for Representatives, and digital and IT infrastructure initiatives. See \"Overview\" within MD&A for more information on our Open Up Avon Strategy.\nAs we work to right-size our cost structure, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from one or more of the various restructuring and cost-savings initiatives we may undertake as part of these efforts in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. Other events and circumstances, such as financial and strategic difficulties and delays or unexpected costs, including the impact of foreign currency and inflationary pressures, may occur which could result in our not realizing our targets or in offsetting the financial benefits of reaching those targets. If we are unable to realize these savings or benefits, or otherwise fail to invest in the growth initiatives, our business may be adversely affected. In addition, any plans to invest these savings and benefits ahead of future growth means that such costs will be incurred whether or not we realize these savings and benefits. We are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with these initiatives, and the failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from such initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to improve revenue, margins and net income or to achieve profitable growth.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to improve revenue, margins and net income, or to achieve profitable growth in the future, particularly in our largest markets and developing and emerging markets, such as Brazil, Mexico and Russia. Our revenue in 2019 was $4,763.2 million, compared with $5,571.3 million in 2018 and $5,715.6 million in 2017. Improving\nrevenue, margins and net income and achieving profitable growth will depend on our ability to improve financial and operational performance and execute our global business strategy, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these goals. Our ability to improve could be hindered by competing business priorities and projects.\nTo improve revenue, margins and net income and to achieve profitable growth, we also need to successfully implement certain initiatives, including Open Up Avon, and there can no assurance that we will be able to do so. Our achievement of profitable growth is also subject to the strengths and weaknesses of our individual international markets, which are or may be impacted by global economic conditions. We cannot assure that our broad-based geographic portfolio will be able to withstand an economic downturn, recession, cost or wage inflation, commodity cost pressures, economic or political instability (including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates), competitive pressures or other market pressures in one or more particular regions.\nFailure to improve revenue, margins and net income and to achieve profitable growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is conducted primarily in one channel, direct selling.\nOur business is conducted primarily in the direct-selling channel. Sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by Representatives, who are independent contractors and not our employees. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 5 million average Active Representatives. There is a high rate of turnover among Representatives, which is a common characteristic of the direct-selling business. In order to reverse losses of Representatives and grow our business in the future, we need to recruit, retain and service Representatives on a continuing basis. Among other things, we need to create attractive Representative earning opportunities and transform the value chain, restore field health and sales force effectiveness, successfully implement other initiatives in the direct-selling channel, successfully execute our digital strategy, including e-commerce, improve our brochure and product offerings and improve our marketing and advertising. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these objectives. Our direct-selling model contains an inherent risk of bad debt associated with providing Representatives with credit, which is exacerbated if the financial condition of the Representatives deteriorates. Additionally, consumer purchasing habits, including reducing purchases of beauty and related products generally, or reducing purchases from Representatives through direct selling by buying beauty and related products in other channels such as retail, could reduce our sales, impact our ability to execute our global business strategy or have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if we lose market share in the direct-selling channel, our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if any government or regulatory body such as Brazil or the European Union, bans or severely restricts our business methods or operational/commercial model of direct selling, our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to financial risks as a result of our international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of foreign currency restrictions.\nWe operate globally, through operations in various locations around the world, and derive all of our consolidated revenue from operations outside of the U.S.\nOne risk associated with our international operations is that the functional currency for most of our international operations is their local currency. The primary foreign currencies for which we have significant exposures include the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, British pound, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, the euro, Mexican peso, Peruvian new sol, Philippine peso, Polish zloty, Romanian leu, Russian ruble, South African rand, Turkish lira and Ukrainian hryvnia. As the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to our foreign currencies, our revenues and profits are reduced when translated into U.S. dollars and our margins may be negatively impacted by country mix if our higher margin markets experience significant devaluation. In addition, our costs are more weighted to U.S. dollars while our sales are denominated in local currencies. Although we typically work to mitigate this negative foreign currency transaction impact through price increases and further actions to reduce costs, and by shifting costs to markets in which we generate revenue, we may not be able to fully offset the impact, if at all. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage these various foreign currency impacts and there can be no assurance that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.\nAnother risk associated with our international operations is the possibility that a foreign government may tax or impose foreign currency remittance restrictions. Due to the possibility of government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates, we may not be able to immediately repatriate cash. If this should occur, or if the exchange rates devalue, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.\nInflation is another risk associated with our international operations. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings. High rates of inflation or the related devaluation of foreign currency may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations or cash flows. For example, Argentina has been designated as a highly inflationary economy.\nSee \"Segment Review - South Latin America\" within MD&A of our 2019 Annual Report for additional information regarding Argentina. In addition, there can be no assurance that other countries in which we operate will not become highly inflationary and that our revenue, operating profit and net income will not be adversely impacted as a result.\nOur ability to improve our financial performance depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences.\nOur ability to improve our financial performance depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences for beauty and related products. We must continually work to develop, produce and market new products, maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands, achieve a favorable mix of products, and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products. Consumer spending patterns and preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly. In addition, certain market trends may be short-lived. There can be no assurance that we will be able to anticipate and respond to trends timely and effectively in the market for beauty and related products and changing consumer demands and improve our financial results.\nFurthermore, material shifts or decreases in market demand for our products, including as a result of changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences or incorrect forecasting of market demand, could result in us carrying inventory that cannot be sold at anticipated prices or increased product returns by the Representatives. Failure to maintain proper inventory levels or increased product returns by the Representatives could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success depends, in part, on our key personnel.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel. The unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business. Our success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, attract, train, develop and retain other highly qualified personnel. Competition for these employees can be intense and our ability to hire, attract and retain them depends on our ability to provide competitive compensation. We may not be able to attract, assimilate, develop or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, including the execution of our global business strategy. As a result of the Natura merger, significant changes were made to the Company's senior management in January 2020, including a new chief executive officer and a new chief financial officer. Such turnover creates a risk of business processes not being sustained if the turnover occurs with inadequate knowledge transfer. Any failure by our management team to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. This risk may be exacerbated by the uncertainties associated with the implementation of Open Up Avon and any other stabilization strategies and restructuring and cost-savings initiatives we undertake from time to time.\nA general economic downturn, a recession globally or in one or more of our geographic regions or markets or sudden disruption in business conditions or other challenges may adversely affect our business, our access to liquidity and capital, and our credit ratings.\nCurrent global macro-economic instability or a further downturn in the economies in which we sell our products, including any recession in one or more of our geographic regions or markets could adversely affect our business, our access to liquidity and capital, and our credit ratings. Economic events, including high unemployment levels and recession, have resulted in challenges to our business and a heightened concern regarding further deterioration globally. In addition, as mentioned above, our business is conducted primarily in the direct-selling channel. We could experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash flow due to reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors caused by such economic, operational or business challenges. Any or all of these factors could potentially have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources and credit ratings, including our ability to access short-term financing, raise additional capital, reduce flexibility with respect to working capital, and maintain credit lines and offshore cash balances.\nConsumer spending is also generally affected by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, energy costs, gasoline prices and consumer confidence generally, all of which are beyond our control. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, such as beauty and related products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower, and may impact sales of our products. We may face continued economic challenges in 2020 because customers may continue to have less money for discretionary purchases as a result of job losses, bankruptcies, and reduced access to credit, among other things.\nIn addition, sudden disruptions in business conditions and consumer spending may result from acts of terror, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, and pandemic situations or large-scale power outages, none of which are under our control.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported in China and other countries. While we do not currently have significant operations in geographical locations where the coronavirus was initially reported to be most prevalent, we source certain services, finished products, ingredients and packaging materials from vendors in Asia. We cannot reasonably estimate at this time the impact, if any, that the coronavirus may have on our business or operations. The extent to which the coronavirus\nimpacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact including on financial markets or otherwise.\nOur credit ratings are below investment grade, which could limit our access to financing, affect the market price of our financing and increase financing costs. A downgrade in our credit ratings may adversely affect our access to liquidity.\nOur long-term credit ratings are: Moody\u2019s ratings of Negative Outlook with B1 for corporate family debt, B3 for senior unsecured debt, and Ba1 for our Senior Secured Notes; S&P ratings of Stable Outlook with B+ for corporate family debt and senior unsecured debt and BB for our Senior Secured Notes; and Fitch rating of Positive Outlook with B+, each of which are below investment grade. However, our credit ratings remain below investment grade which may impact our ability to access such transactions on favorable terms. We do not believe these long-term credit ratings will have a material impact on our near-term liquidity. However, any rating agency review could result in a change in outlook or downgrade, which could limit our access to new financing, reduce our flexibility with respect to working capital needs, affect the market price of some or all of our outstanding debt securities and could result in an increase in financing costs. See Note 8, Debt and Other Financing in our 2019 Annual Report for details about the terms of our existing debt and other financing arrangements.\nOur indebtedness and any future inability to meet any of our obligations under our indebtedness, could adversely affect us by reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.6 billion of indebtedness outstanding. We may also incur additional long-term indebtedness and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs, subject to certain restrictions under our indebtedness, including our Senior Secured Notes (each, as described below), which would increase our total indebtedness. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings and other financing may be unavailable in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our current and future financial obligations or our other liquidity needs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. Our indebtedness could have material negative consequences on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows, including the following:\n\u2022limitations on our ability to obtain additional debt financing sufficient to fund growth, such as working capital and capital expenditures requirements or to meet other cash requirements, in particular during periods in which credit markets are weak;\n\u2022a downgrade in our credit ratings, as discussed above;\n\u2022a limitation on our flexibility to plan for, or react to, competitive challenges in our business and the beauty industry;\n\u2022the possibility that we are put at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with less debt or debt with more favorable terms than us, and competitors that may be in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources and withstand economic downturns;\n\u2022limitations on our ability to execute business development activities to support our strategies or ability to execute restructuring as necessary; and\n\u2022limitations on our ability to invest in recruiting, retaining and servicing the Representatives.\nOur Senior Secured Notes are secured by first-priority liens on and security interests in substantially all of the assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. Our Senior Secured Notes contain customary covenants, including, among other things, limits on the ability of the Company and any restricted subsidiary to, subject to certain exceptions, incur liens, incur debt, make restricted payments, make investments or, with respect to certain entities, merge, consolidate or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets. In addition, we could have difficulty undertaking other alternatives to avoid noncompliance, such as obtaining necessary waivers from compliance with, or necessary amendments to, the covenants contained in our Senior Secured Notes or repurchasing certain debt, and we could have difficulty addressing the impact any non-compliance with these covenants may have on our ability to secure financing with favorable terms.\nOur ability to conduct business in our international markets may be affected by political, legal, tax and regulatory risks.\nOur ability to achieve growth in our international markets, and to improve operations in our existing international markets, is exposed to various risks, including:\n\u2022the possibility that a foreign government might ban, halt or severely restrict our business, including our primary method of direct selling;\n\u2022the possibility that local civil unrest, economic or political instability, bureaucratic delays, changes in macro-economic conditions, changes in diplomatic or trade relationships (including any sanctions, restrictions and other responses such as those related to Russia and Ukraine) or other uncertainties might disrupt our operations in an international market;\n\u2022the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain areas where we operate;\n\u2022the adoption of new U.S. or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities, including exposure to tax assessments without prior notice or the opportunity to review the basis for any such assessments in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022the possibility that a government authority might impose legal, tax or other financial burdens on the Representatives, as direct sellers, or on Avon, due, for example, to the structure of our operations in various markets, or additional taxes on our products, including in Brazil;\n\u2022the possibility that a government authority might challenge the status of the Representatives as independent contractors or impose employment or social taxes on the Representatives; and\n\u2022those associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data.\nWe are also subject to the adoption, interpretation and enforcement by governmental agencies abroad and in the U.S. (including on federal, state and local levels) of other laws, rules, regulations or policies, including any changes thereto, such as restrictions on trade, competition, manufacturing, license and permit requirements, import and export license requirements, privacy and data protection laws, anti-trust laws, anti-corruption laws, environmental laws, records and information management, tariffs and taxes, laws relating to the sourcing of \"conflict minerals,\" health care reform requirements such as those required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act, and regulation of our brochures, product claims or ingredients, which may require us to adjust our operations and systems in certain markets where we do business.\nFor example, from time to time, local governments and others question the legal status of Representatives or impose burdens inconsistent with the Representative's status as independent contractors, often in regard to possible coverage under social benefit laws that would require us (and, in most instances, the Representatives) to make regular contributions to government social benefit funds.\nIf we are unable to address these matters in a satisfactory manner, or adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements, our business, costs and/or reputation may be adversely affected. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome or the impact that pending or future legislative and regulatory changes may have on our business in the future.\nOur business is subject to a number of foreign laws and regulations in various jurisdictions governing data privacy and security.\nWe collect, use and store personal data of our employees, Representatives, customers and other third parties in the ordinary course of business. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy and security laws and regulations governing the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other data, including the transfer of personal data between countries. In May 2018 the EU adopted robust data privacy regulations under the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). Further changes are likely to be introduced through a revised Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the \u201cePrivacy Regulation\u201d). The GDPR in particular has broad extraterritorial effect and imposes a robust data protection compliance regime with significant penalties for non-compliance. Other countries in which we operate are developing comparable regulations. Brazil have introduced the Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais (or LGPD), which is broadly equivalent to GDPR and takes effect in 2020. In general, the GDPR and ePrivacy Regulation, and other local privacy laws, could require adaptation of our technologies or practices to satisfy local privacy requirements and standards. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could result in the issuance of stop processing orders, subject us to fines, penalties or orders to cease, delay or modify collection, use or transfers of personal data. That or other circumstances related to our collection, use and transfer of personal data could cause a loss of reputation in the market or adversely affect our business.\nThe scope of data privacy and security regulations continues to evolve, and we believe that the adoption of increasingly restrictive regulations in this area may be likely within the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with data privacy and security restrictions could increase the cost of our operations and failure to comply with such restrictions could subject us to criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties.\nA failure, disruption, cyberattack or other breach in the security of an IT system or infrastructure that we utilize could adversely affect our business and reputation and increase our costs.\nWe employ IT systems to support our business, including systems to support financial reporting, web-based tools, enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") systems, and internal communication and data transfer networks. We increasingly rely on a variety of web-based systems and mobile applications to support Representatives in our markets, including electronic order collection, invoicing systems, shipping and box packing, social media tools, Representative recruitment and on-line training. We also have e-commerce sites to allow customers to purchase products directly. We use third-party service providers in many instances to provide or support these IT systems. Over the last several years, we have undertaken initiatives to increase our reliance on IT systems which has resulted in the outsourcing of certain services and functions, such as global human resources IT systems, call center support, Representative support services and other IT processes. Our IT systems and infrastructure, as well as the systems, infrastructure and services of those of third parties, are integral to our performance.\nAny of our IT systems and infrastructure, or those of our third-party service providers, may be susceptible to outages, disruptions, destruction or corruption due to the complex landscape of localized applications and architectures as well as incidents related to legacy or unintegrated systems. These IT systems and infrastructure also may be susceptible to cybersecurity breaches, attacks, computer viruses, break-ins, including ransomware, other malware and phishing attacks, data corruption, fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events beyond our control. We rely on our employees, Representatives and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error or malfeasance or failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. Furthermore, our ability to protect and monitor the practices of our third-party service providers is more limited than our ability to protect and monitor our own IT systems and infrastructure.\nOur IT systems, or those of our third-party service providers may be accessed by unauthorized users such as cyber criminals as a result of a failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach, exposing us to risk. As techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, a failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach may go undetected for a long period of time. An actual or perceived failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach of our IT systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party service providers, could result in the theft, transfer, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of Company, employee, Representative, customer, vendor, or other third-party data, including sensitive or confidential data, personal information and intellectual property and could be particularly harmful to our brand and reputation.\nWe continue to invest in industry-standard solutions and protections and monitoring practices of our data and IT systems and infrastructure to reduce these risks and we continue to monitor our IT systems and infrastructure on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. We have also deployed additional employee security training and updated security policies for the Company and its third-party service providers. Such efforts and investments are costly, and as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. As a company that operates globally, we could also be impacted by commercial agreements between us and processing organizations, existing and proposed laws and regulations, and government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.\nDespite our efforts, our and our third-party service providers\u2019 data, IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable. There can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent a failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach of our or our third-party service providers\u2019 IT systems or infrastructure, or that we will detect and appropriately respond if there is such a failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach. Our IT databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to ransomware, denial of service and phishing attacks, none of which has been material to the Company to date. Any such failure, disruption, cyberattack or other security breach could adversely affect our business including our ability to expand our business, cause damage to our reputation, result in increased costs to address internal data, security, and personnel issues, and result in violations of applicable privacy laws and other laws and external financial obligations such as governmental fines, penalties, or regulatory proceedings, remediation efforts such as breach notification and identity theft monitoring, and third-party private litigation with potentially significant costs. In addition, it could result in deterioration in our employees', Representatives', customers', or vendors' confidence in us, which could cause them to discontinue doing business with us or result in other competitive disadvantages. In addition, there may be other challenges and risks as we upgrade, modernize, and standardize our IT systems globally.\nThe Company is not aware of any material cybersecurity incidents to date.\nWe face intense competition and can make no assurances about our ability to overcome our competitive challenges.\nWe face intense competition from competing products in each of our lines of business in the markets we operate. We compete against products sold to consumers in a number of distribution methods, including direct selling, through the Internet, and through mass market retail and prestige retail channels. We also face increasing direct-selling and retail competition in our developing and emerging markets, particularly Brazil and Russia.\nWithin the direct-selling channel, we often compete on country-by-country basis with our direct-selling competitors. There are a number of direct-selling companies that sell product lines similar to ours, some of which have worldwide operations and compete with us globally. Unlike a typical CPG company which operates within a broad-based consumer pool, direct sellers\ncompete for representative or entrepreneurial talent by providing a more competitive earnings opportunity or \"better deal\" than that offered by the competition. Providing a compelling earnings opportunity for the Representatives is as critical as developing and marketing new and innovative products. Therefore, in contrast to typical CPG companies, we must first compete for a limited pool of Representatives before we reach the ultimate consumer.\nRepresentatives are attracted to a direct seller by competitive earnings opportunities, often through what are commonly known as \"field incentives\" in the direct-selling industry. Competitors devote substantial effort to finding out the effectiveness of such incentives so that they can invest in incentives that are the most cost-effective or produce the better payback. As one of the largest and oldest beauty direct sellers globally, Avon's business model and strategies are often highly sought after, particularly by smaller and more nimble competitors who seek to capitalize on our investment and experience. As a result, we are subject to significant competition for the recruitment of Representatives from other direct-selling or network marketing organizations as well as significant competition from other non-direct selling earnings opportunities for which our existing Representatives or potential Representatives could avail themselves. Changes to our compensation models are sometimes necessary to be competitive but could have short-term negative impacts on our total number of Representatives. It is therefore continually necessary to innovate and enhance our direct-selling and service model as well as to recruit and retain new Representatives. If we are unable to do so, our business will be adversely affected.\nWithin the broader CPG industry, we principally compete against large and well-known cosmetics (color), fragrance and skincare companies that manufacture and sell broad product lines through various types of retail establishments and other channels, including through the Internet. In addition, we compete against many other companies that manufacture and sell more narrow beauty product lines sold through retail establishments and other channels, including through the Internet. This industry is highly competitive, and some of our principal competitors in the CPG industry are larger than we are and have greater resources than we do. Competitive activities on their part could cause our sales to suffer. We also have many highly competitive global branded and private label competitors in the accessories, apparel, housewares, and gift and decorative products industries, including retail establishments, principally department stores, mass merchandisers, gift shops and specialty retailers. Our principal competition in the highly competitive fashion jewelry industry consists of a few large companies and many small companies that sell fashion jewelry through department stores, mass merchandisers, specialty retailers and e-commerce.\nThe number of competitors and degree of competition that we face in the beauty and related products industry varies widely from country to country. If our advertising, promotional, merchandising or other marketing strategies are not successful, if we are unable to improve our product mix and offer new products that represent technological breakthroughs and are aligned with local preferences, if we do not successfully manage the timing of new product introductions or the profitability of these efforts, if we are unable to improve the Representative experience, or if for other reasons the Representatives or end customers perceive competitors' products as having greater appeal, then our sales, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected.\nThird-party suppliers provide, among other things, the raw materials required for our Beauty products, and the loss of these suppliers, a supplier's inability to supply a raw material or a finished product or a disruption or interruption in the supply chain may adversely affect our business.\nWe manufacture and package the majority of our Beauty products, which are formulated and designed by our staff of chemists, designers and artists. Raw materials, consisting chiefly of essential oils, chemicals, containers and packaging components required for our Beauty products are purchased from a range of third-party suppliers. The remainder of our Beauty products and all of our Fashion & Home products are purchased from various third-party manufacturers. Our products are affected by the cost and availability of materials such as glass, plastics, chemicals and fabrics. For the vast majority of items we have more than one source of supply available. We believe that we can continue to obtain sufficient raw materials and supplies to manufacture and produce our Beauty products for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we design the brochures that are used by the Representatives to sell our products. The brochures are then produced on our behalf by a range of printing suppliers.\nThe loss of any one supplier would not have a material impact on our ability to source raw materials for the majority of our Beauty products or source products for the remainder of our Beauty products and all of our Fashion & Home products or paper for the brochures. This risk may be exacerbated by our globally-coordinated purchasing strategy, which leverages volumes. Regulatory action, such as restrictions on importation, may also disrupt or interrupt our supply chain. Furthermore, increases in the costs of raw materials or other commodities may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, if our suppliers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, such as any child labor laws, our reputation could be harmed due to negative publicity.\nSignificant changes in pension fund investment performance, assumptions relating to pension costs or required legal changes in pension funding rules may have a material effect on the valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension plans and our pension cost.\nOur funding policy for pension plans is to meet the minimum required contributions under applicable law and accumulate plan assets that, over the long run, are expected to approximate the present value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is\nmaterially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets, including equity and debt securities and derivative instruments, or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets. A change in the discount rate could result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years. Similarly, changes in the expected rate of return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost. Please see \"Critical Accounting Estimates - Pension and Postretirement Expense\" within MD&A and Note 14, Employee Benefit Plans in our 2019 Annual Report, for additional information regarding the impact of these factors on our pension plan obligations.\nAny strategic alliances or divestitures may expose us to additional risks.\nWe evaluate potential strategic alliances that would complement our current product offerings, increase the size and geographic scope of our operations or otherwise offer growth and/or operating efficiency opportunities. Strategic alliances may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u2022substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties, including difficulties in leveraging synergies among the businesses to increase sales and obtain cost savings or achieve expected results;\n\u2022difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including the loss of key employees from any acquired businesses and disruption to our direct-selling channel;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and\n\u2022reputational and other risks regarding our ability to successfully implement such strategic alliances, including obtaining financing which could dilute the interests of our shareholders, result in an increase in our indebtedness or both.\nOur failure to successfully complete the integration of any new or acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate such transactions on favorable terms.\nFor divestitures, success is also dependent on effectively and efficiently separating the divested unit or business from the Company and reducing or eliminating associated overhead costs. In cases where a divestiture is not successfully implemented or completed, the Company's business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Please see \"Risks Related to the Separation of North America\" below for additional information regarding the risks associated with the separation of North America.\nThe loss of, or a disruption in, our manufacturing and distribution operations could adversely affect our business.\nOur principal properties consist of worldwide manufacturing facilities for the production of Beauty products, distribution centers where offices are located and where finished merchandise is packed and shipped to Representatives in fulfillment of their orders, and one principal research and development facility. Additionally, we use third-party manufacturers to manufacture certain of our products. Therefore, as a company engaged in manufacturing, distribution and research and development on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, fires, strikes and other labor or industrial disputes, disruptions in logistics or information systems (such as our ERP system), loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites, product quality control issues, safety concerns, licensing requirements and other regulatory or government issues, as well as natural disasters, pandemics, border disputes, acts of terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. We could also experience a negative financial impact if we do not comply with minimum purchase commitments. These risks may be exacerbated by our efforts to increase facility consolidation covering our manufacturing, distribution and supply footprints, particularly if we are unable to successfully increase our resiliency to potential operational disruptions or enhance our disaster recovery planning. The loss of, or damage to, any of our facilities or centers, or those of our third-party manufacturers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality, safety and efficacy of our products.\nOur success depends, in part, on the quality, safety and efficacy of our products. If our products are found to be, or perceived to be, defective or unsafe, or if they otherwise fail to meet the Representatives' or end customers' standards, then our relationship with the Representatives or end customers could suffer, we may need to recall some of our products and/or become subject to regulatory action, our reputation or the appeal of our brand could be diminished, we could lose market share, and we could\nbecome subject to liability claims, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, specifically patents and trademarks, our ability to compete could be adversely affected.\nThe market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our product innovations and our brand equity. We own the material patents and trademarks used in connection with the marketing and distribution of our major products where such products are principally sold. Although most of our material intellectual property is registered in certain countries in which we operate, there can be no assurance with respect to the rights associated with such intellectual property in those countries. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries, including many emerging markets, may not completely protect our intellectual property rights. The costs required to protect our patents and trademarks, especially in emerging markets, may be substantial. Please see \"The licensing of our North America intellectual property rights, including trademarks that are fundamental to our brand, in connection with the Separation could adversely impact our reputation, our business generally, and our ability to enforce intellectual property rights used in both North America and international jurisdictions\" below for additional information regarding the risks on our intellectual property rights associated with the separation of North America.\nWe are involved, and may become involved in the future, in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are and may, in the future, become party to litigation, including, for example, claims alleging violation of the federal securities laws or claims relating to employee or employment matters, our products or advertising. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time-consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect our financial results and the conduct of our business. We are currently vigorously contesting certain of these litigation claims. However, it is not possible to predict the final resolution of the litigation to which we currently are or may in the future become party, or to predict the impact of certain of these matters on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 19, Contingencies in our 2019 Annual Report for a detailed discussion regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are a party.\nGovernment reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions could harm our business or reputation. In addition, from time to time we may conduct other investigations and reviews, the consequences of which could negatively impact our business or reputation.\nAs we operate in various locations around the world, our operations in certain countries are subject to significant governmental scrutiny and may be harmed by the results of such scrutiny. The regulatory environment with regard to direct selling in emerging and developing markets where we do business is evolving, and government officials in such locations often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply relevant regulations. From time to time, we may receive formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities about our business and compliance with local laws and regulations. In addition, from time to time, we may conduct investigations and reviews. The consequences of such government reviews, inquiries, investigations, and actions or such investigations and reviews may adversely impact our business, prospects, reputation, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows.\nAdditionally, any determination that our operations or activities, or, where local law mandates, the activities of the Representatives, including our licenses or permits, importing or exporting, or product testing or approvals are not, or were not, in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, civil and criminal penalties, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationship, termination of necessary licenses and permits, modification of business practices and compliance programs, equitable remedies, including disgorgement, injunctive relief and other sanctions that we may take against our personnel or that may be taken against us or our personnel. Other legal or regulatory proceedings, as well as government investigations, which often involve complex legal issues and are subject to uncertainties, may also follow as a consequence. Further, other countries in which we do business may initiate their own investigations and impose similar sanctions. These proceedings or investigations could be costly and burdensome to our management, and could adversely impact our business, prospects, reputation, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows. Even if an inquiry or investigation does not result in any adverse determinations, it potentially could create negative publicity and give rise to third-party litigation or action.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the UK's decision to withdraw from the EU may adversely affect our business.\nOn June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as \"Brexit.\" As a result of the referendum, the UK parliament voted in March 2017 to trigger Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, commencing the UK's official withdrawal process from the EU and initiating negotiations with the EU in June 2017. In January 2020, the House of Commons (the first chamber of the UK parliament) approved the terms of an agreement with the EU to\ndetermine the future terms of the parties' relationship, including the terms of trade between the UK and the EU and other nations, following the UK's exit from the EU on January 31, 2020.\nThe terms of the agreement were approved by the House of Lords (the second chamber of the UK parliament) on January 23, 2020 meaning that the Bill became law and the UK left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transition period, lasting until December 31, 2020, has now begun, during which the UK will continue to (i) be subject to EU rules and (ii) remain a member of the single market. While the agreement provides for the possibility of one or more extensions of this transition period for up to two additional years, the UK has currently ruled out any such extension. The EU and the UK will also continue to negotiate trading agreements and security cooperation during this period. An update on these negotiations is expected in June and at this time we will know whether (i) a long term deal has been agreed, (ii) the transition period will be extended or (iii) the transition period will end without a deal.\nOur business in the UK and EU had contingency plans in place to mitigate any negative effects of a no deal Brexit and, should the transition period end without a deal, departure from the EU in such a way they would reactivate such plans. However, in the longer term (2021 onwards) such a departure could adversely affect business activity, restrict the movement of capital and the mobility of personnel and goods, and otherwise impair political stability and economic conditions in the UK, the Eurozone, the EU and elsewhere. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on business activity in the UK, the Eurozone, or the EU. Given that we conduct a substantial portion of our business in the EU and the UK, and our corporate headquarters has been relocated to the UK, any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, liquidity and results of operations or cash flows.\nThe uncertainty concerning the terms of the exit could also have a negative impact on the growth of the UK and/or EU economies and has already caused significant volatility in global stock markets and greater volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, including the pound sterling, euro and/or other currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a material effect on our net sales, financial condition, profitability and/or cash flows and may reduce the reported value of our operating results.\nChanges to UK border and immigration policy could likewise occur as a result of Brexit, affecting our ability to recruit and retain employees from outside the UK and resulting in possible delays in transportation of goods and increased custom duties. While the full scope of implementation of the referendum decision is still unclear, companies exposed to or with operations in the UK, such as ours, may face significant regulatory changes as a result of Brexit implementation, and complying with such new regulatory mandates may prove challenging and costly.\nRisks Related to the Separation of North America and the Preferred Stock Investment in the Company\nWe may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation of our North America business.\nOn March 1, 2016, Cleveland Apple Investor L.P. (\"Cerberus Investor\") (an affiliate of Cerberus) contributed $170 million of cash into New Avon in exchange for 80.1% of its membership interests, and we contributed (i) assets primarily related to our North America business (including approximately $100 million of cash, subject to certain adjustments), (ii) certain assumed liabilities (primarily pension and postretirement liabilities) of our North America business and (iii) the employees of our North America business into New Avon in exchange for a 19.9% ownership interest of New Avon (collectively, the \"Separation\"). In August 2019, we and Cerberus finalized the sale of our respective interests in New Avon to LG Household & Health Care Ltd. In connection with the Separation, we entered into a Separation Agreement and various other agreements with New Avon to govern the separation and the relationship of the two companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us. The indemnity rights we have against New Avon under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us. In addition, our indemnity obligations to New Avon may be significant and these risks could negatively affect our financial condition.\nWe or New Avon may fail to perform under the post-closing arrangements executed in connection with the Separation.\nIn connection with the Separation, we and New Avon entered into several agreements, including among others, an Intellectual Property License Agreement, a Technical Support and Innovation Agreement and a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement. The Intellectual Property License Agreement provides New Avon with rights to use certain intellectual property rights that we used in the conduct of the North America business prior to the Separation. The Technical Support and Innovation Agreement provides that we will perform certain beauty product development services for New Avon. The Manufacturing and Supply Agreement provides that we and New Avon will manufacture, or cause to be manufactured, and supply certain products to each other. These agreements establish a bilateral relationship between New Avon and us. We will rely on New Avon to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If New Avon is unable to satisfy its obligations under these\nagreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe licensing of our North America intellectual property rights, including trademarks that are fundamental to our brand, in connection with the Separation could adversely impact our reputation, our business generally, and our ability to enforce intellectual property rights used in both North America and international jurisdictions.\nIn connection with the Separation, we granted New Avon a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license, with the ability to sublicense, to certain intellectual property rights that we used in the conduct of our North America business prior to the Separation. The Intellectual Property License Agreement includes quality control provisions obligating New Avon and its sublicensees to remain in compliance with applicable law or, for certain of our brands, quality standards that we have provided to New Avon, when selling products under certain trademarks that we have licensed to New Avon. However, there is a risk that failure by New Avon or its sublicensees to comply with such quality control provisions or other conduct by New Avon or its sublicensees associated with the trademarks licensed to New Avon, could adversely affect our reputation and our business globally. We have also granted New Avon enforcement rights to intellectual property licensed to New Avon in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our position and options globally relating to enforcement of our intellectual property.", "PERMNO": 40416, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "AVP"}
