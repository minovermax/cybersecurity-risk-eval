{"cik": "926423", "company": "MIND TECHNOLOGY, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-04-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Form 10-K. The risk factors described below are not the only risks we face. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be affected by additional factors that are not currently known to us, that we currently consider immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic (the \u201cglobal pandemic\u201d) may amplify many of the risks discussed below to which we are subject and, given the unpredictable, unprecedented and fluid nature of the pandemic, it may materially and adversely affect us in ways that are not anticipated by or known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risk.\nYou should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements included under \u201cCautionary Statements About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d of this Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below.\nRisk Related to Our Financial Condition\nThe Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern could impact our ability to obtain capital financing and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe Company has a history of operating losses and has had negative cash from operating activities in the last two years. In addition, the global pandemic has created significant additional uncertainty and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. After considering various factors, Management believes that the Company will continue to meet its obligations as the arise over the next 12 months. (See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRisk Related to the Operation of Our Business\nA limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenues and the loss of one of these customers could harm our results of operations.\nWe typically sell equipment to a relatively small number of customers, the composition of which changes from year to year as customers\u2019 equipment needs vary. Therefore, at any one time, a large portion of our revenues may be derived from a limited number of customers. In fiscal 2021and 2020, our single largest customer accounted for approximately 15% and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Together, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 47% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2021. There has been consolidation among certain of our customers and this trend may continue. This consolidation could result in the loss of one or more of our customers and could result in a decrease in the demand for our equipment. The demand for our government-related services is generally driven by the level of government program funding. The state of the economy, competing political priorities, public funds and the timing of payment of these funds may influence the amount and timing of spending by our customers who are government agencies. The loss of any one of our largest customers or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe financial soundness of our customers could materially affect our business and operating results.\nIf our customers experience financial difficulties or their own customers delay payment to them, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to us. Disruptions in the financial markets or other macro-economic issues, such as volatility in price of oil or other hydrocarbons or a worldwide pandemic, such as COVID-19, could exacerbate financial difficulties for our customers. Any inability of customers to pay us for product and services could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had approximately $5.7 million of gross customer accounts receivable, of which approximately $1.1 million was over 180 days past due. Our allowance for doubtful accounts of $948,000 is substantially related to accounts that are over 180 days past due. For fiscal 2021, we had net charges to our provision for doubtful accounts of approximately $659,000 and $470,000 related to continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively. For fiscal 2020 we had net charges to our provision for doubtful accounts of approximately zero and $2.0 million related to continuing and discontinued operations, respectively. Significant payment defaults by our customers in excess of our allowance for doubtful accounts would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe derive a substantial amount of our revenues from foreign operations and sales, which pose additional risks including economic, political and other uncertainties.\nWe conduct continuing operations on a global scale. Our international continuing operations include locations in Malaysia, the United Kingdom and Singapore. For fiscal 2021 and 2020, approximately 83% and 87%, respectively, of our revenues were attributable to customers in foreign countries.\nOur international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent to any business operating in foreign countries, and especially those with emerging markets. As we continue to increase our presence in such countries, our operations will encounter the following risks, among others:\n\u2022government instability, which can cause investment in capital projects by our potential clients to be withdrawn or delayed, reducing or eliminating the viability of some markets for our services;\n\u2022potential expropriation, seizure, nationalization or detention of assets;\n\u2022difficulty in repatriating foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements;\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency;\n\u2022import/export quotas and evolving export license requirements;\n\u2022civil uprisings, riots and war, which can make it unsafe to continue operations, adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose us to losses;\n\u2022availability of suitable personnel and equipment, which can be affected by government policy, or changes in policy, which limit the importation of qualified crewmembers or specialized equipment in areas where local resources are insufficient;\n\u2022decrees, laws, regulations, interpretation and court decisions under legal systems, which are not always fully developed, and which may be retroactively applied and cause us to incur unanticipated and/or unrecoverable costs as well as delays which may result in real or opportunity costs;\n\u2022terrorist attacks, including kidnappings of our personnel or those of our customers;\n\u2022political and economic uncertainties in certain countries which cause delays or cancellation of projects;\n\u2022the United States or foreign countries could enact legislation or impose regulations or other restrictions, including unfavorable labor regulations, tax policies, tariffs, trade restrictions, or economic sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in or expatriate profits from the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022environmental conditions and regulatory controls or initiatives in some countries that may impose additional or more stringent requirements than found in the United States and which may not be consistently applied or enforced; and\n\u2022regulations, laws or emergency measures taken or imposed by the United States or foreign state and local governments and municipalities in response to emergency or crisis situations, including natural disasters or pandemics, such as COVID-19, which could have an adverse effect on our business, our customers or our operations.\nWe cannot predict the nature and the likelihood of any such events. However, if any of these or other similar events should occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with conducting business internationally, including failure to comply with United States laws that apply to international operations.\nSome of our products are subject to export control regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d) administered by the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (\u201cDDTC\u201d) and the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d). We are also subject to foreign assets control and economic sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), which restrict or prohibit our ability to transact with certain foreign countries, individuals and entities. Under these regulations, the sale or transfer of certain equipment to a location outside the United States may require prior approval in the form of an export license issued by the BIS or DDTC. Some potential international transactions may also be restricted or prohibited based on the location, nationality or identity of the potential end user, customer or other parties to the transaction or may require prior authorization in the form of an OFAC license. Any delay in obtaining required governmental approvals could affect our ability to conclude a sale or timely commence a project, and the failure to comply with all such controls could result in criminal and/or civil penalties, including fines, imprisonment, denial of export privileges and debarment from contracting with the federal government. These international transactions may otherwise be subject to tariffs and import/export restrictions from the United States or other governments.\nWe are subject to taxation in many foreign jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide. Our tax returns are subject to routine examination by taxing authorities, and these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest.\nOur overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social and political conditions. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, which could negatively affect our profitability.\nDue to the international scope of our business activities, our results of operations may be significantly affected by currency fluctuations.\nWe operate on a global scale and while the majority of our foreign revenues are contracted in U.S. dollars, locally sourced items and expenditures are predominately transacted in local currency. These costs are subject to the risk of taxation policies, expropriation, political turmoil, civil disturbances, armed hostilities, and other geopolitical hazards as well as foreign currency exchange controls (in which payment may not be made in U.S. dollars) and fluctuations.\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), including the subsequent exchange rate fluctuations and political and economic uncertainties, may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. The United Kingdom entered into a new trade agreement with the European Union on December 24, 2020. Despite the December 2020 trade agreement, many potential effects of Brexit remain unclear and pose significant uncertainties in global financial markets and adversely impact the regions in which we and our clients operate. For example, our Seamap facility in the United Kingdom could be subject to higher costs and delays, which could cause disruptions in our delivery schedules to our customers. In the long term, Brexit could also create uncertainty with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we and our customers are subject and lead to divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom government determines which European Union laws to modify or replace. There remains substantial uncertainty surrounding the ultimate effect of Brexit and outcomes could disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Continued adverse consequences, such as deterioration in economic conditions and volatility in currency exchange rates, and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with intellectual property.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information. We also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners to protect our proprietary information, and control access to and distribution of our design information, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts, these measures may not be sufficient to prevent infringement of our patents, copyrights, and trademarks or wrongful misappropriation of our proprietary information and technology. In addition, for technology that is not covered by a patent, these measures will not prevent competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. The laws of many foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and potential adverse decisions by judicial or administrative bodies in foreign countries could impact our international businesses. Failure to protect proprietary information could result in, among other things, loss of competitive advantage, loss of customer orders and decreased revenues.\nAlthough we believe that we have appropriate procedures and safeguards to help ensure that we do not violate a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may unknowingly and inadvertently take action that is inconsistent with a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Consequently, we may be subject to litigation and may be required to defend against claimed infringements of the rights of third parties or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of third parties. Any such litigation could be time consuming, costly and divert management\u2019s attention from operations. In addition, adverse determinations in such litigation could, among other things:\n\u2022result in the loss of our proprietary rights to use the technology;\n\u2022subject us to significant liabilities;\n\u2022require us to seek licenses from third parties;\n\u2022require us to redesign the products that use the technology; and\n\u2022prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products that incorporate the technology.\nIf we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions, our business may be materially adversely affected. Any litigation to protect our intellectual property or to defend ourselves against the claims of others could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and may not ultimately be successful.\nProducts we develop, manufacture and sell may be subject to performance or reliability risks.\nThe production of new products with high technology content involves occasional problems while the technology and manufacturing methods mature. If significant reliability or quality problems develop, including those due to faulty components, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including:\n\u2022costs associated with reworking the manufacturing processes;\n\u2022high service and warranty expenses;\n\u2022high inventory obsolescence expense;\n\u2022high levels of product returns;\n\u2022delays in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022reduced orders from existing customers; and\n\u2022declining interest from potential customers.\nAlthough we maintain accruals for product warranties as we deem necessary, actual costs could exceed these amounts. From time to time, there may be interruptions or delays in the activation of products at a customer\u2019s site. These interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from aspects of the installation and activation activities, some of which are outside our control. If we experience significant interruptions or delays that cannot be promptly resolved, confidence in our products could be undermined, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe may not be successful in implementing and maintaining technology and product development and enhancements. New technology and product developments may cause us to become less competitive.\nNew seismic data acquisition and sonar technologies may be developed. New and enhanced products and services introduced by a competitor may gain market acceptance and, if not available to us, may adversely affect us. If we choose the wrong technology, or if our competitors select a superior technology, we could lose our existing customers and be unable to attract new customers, which would harm our business and operations.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by changing technology and new product introductions. Our business could suffer from unexpected developments in technology, from our failure to adapt to these changes or from necessary capital expenditures to respond to technological introductions or obsolescence. In addition, the preferences and requirements of customers can change rapidly.\nOur business exposes us to various technological risks, including the following:\n\u2022technology obsolescence;\n\u2022required capital expenditures on new technology;\n\u2022dependence upon continued growth of the market for marine seismic data equipment; and\n\u2022difficulties inherent in forecasting advancements in technologies.\nOur inability to develop and implement new technologies or products on a timely basis and at competitive cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to the availability and reliability of component parts used in the manufacture of our products.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for some components of our products, as well as for equipment used to design and test our products. Certain components used in our products may be available from a sole source or limited number of vendors. If these suppliers were to limit or reduce the sale of such components to us, or if these suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or other problems that prevented them from supplying us with the necessary components, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These sole source and other suppliers are each subject to quality and performance issues, materials shortages, excess demand, reduction in capacity and other factors that may disrupt the flow of goods to us; thereby adversely affecting our business and customer relationships. Some of the sole source and limited source vendors are companies who, from time to time, may allocate parts to equipment manufacturers due to market demand for components and equipment. We have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our requirements. Many of our competitors are much larger and may be able to obtain priority allocations from these shared vendors, thereby limiting or making our sources of supply unreliable for these components. If our supply arrangements are interrupted, there can be no assurance that we would be able to find another supplier on a timely or satisfactory basis. Any delay in component availability for any of our products could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenues.\nIf we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components from alternative sources, reduced supplies and higher prices of components will significantly limit our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to customers. A delay in receiving certain components or the inability to receive certain components could harm our customer relationships and our results of operations.\nFailures of components affect the reliability and performance of our products, can reduce customer confidence in our products, and may adversely affect our financial performance. From time to time, we may experience delays in receipt of components and may receive components that do not perform according to their specifications. Any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could harm our business. In addition, a consolidation among suppliers of these components or adverse developments in their businesses that affect their ability to meet our supply demands could adversely impact the availability of components that we depend on. Delayed deliveries from these sources could adversely affect our business.\nA global shortage of key components, such as semiconductors, can disrupt production.\nIf there is a shortage of a key component and the component cannot be easily sourced from a different supplier, the shortage could disrupt our production activities. Wafers are a key component in the production of semiconductors. Wafers have a long production lead time, sometimes up to 30 weeks, which further elevates the shortage. Various factors, including increased demand for consumer electronics, shutdowns due to COVID-19 and long lead times for wafer production, are contributing to the shortage of semiconductors. A shortage of key components such as semiconductors may cause a significant disruption to our production activities, which could have a substantial adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on a small number of suppliers and disruption in vendor supplies could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe purchase many of the components used in our manufacturing from a small number of suppliers. Should our relationships with our suppliers deteriorate, we may have difficulty in obtaining new technology required by our customers and maintaining our existing equipment in accordance with manufacturers\u2019 specifications. In addition, we may, from time to time, experience supply or quality control problems with suppliers, and these problems could significantly affect our ability to meet delivery schedules or other contractual commitments. Also, our suppliers could experience significant cash flow issues or otherwise be negatively impacted by current or future global economic conditions. Please read risk factor \u201cWe face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the recent spread of COVID-19 or novel coronavirus, or fear of such an event\u201d below for a discussion of recent disruptions relating to the recent global pandemic. Reliance on certain suppliers, as well as industry supply conditions, generally involve several risks, including the possibility of a shortage or a lack of availability of key products and increases in product costs and reduced control over delivery schedules; any of these events could adversely affect our future results of operations.\nWe rely on contractors and subcontractors for certain projects, which could affect our results of operations and reputation.\nWe may rely on contractors and subcontractors to complete certain projects. The quality and timing of production and services by our contractors and subcontractors is not totally under our control. Reliance on contractors and subcontractors gives us less control over a project and exposes us to significant risks, including late delivery, substandard quality and high costs. In addition, we may be jointly and severally liable for a contractor or subcontractor\u2019s actions or contract performance. The failure of our contractors or subcontractors to deliver quality products or services in a timely manner could adversely affect our profitability and reputation.\nIncreases in tariffs, trade restrictions, or taxes on our supplies and products could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe purchase a portion of our supplies from suppliers in China and other foreign countries. The commerce we conduct in the international marketplace makes us subject to tariffs, trade restrictions and other taxes when the supplies that we purchase, and the products we ship, cross international borders. Trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as those between the United States and Canada, Mexico and other countries have been escalating in recent years. Trade tensions have led to a series of tariffs imposed by the United States on imports from China, as well as retaliatory tariffs imposed by China on imports from the United States. We believe that certain supplies we purchase from China and other international suppliers could become subject to tariffs that could increase our operation costs. Products we sell into certain foreign markets could also become subject to similar retaliatory tariffs, making the products we sell uncompetitive to similar products not subjected to such import tariffs. Further changes in United States trade policies, tariffs, taxes, export restrictions or other trade barriers or restrictions, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease our profit margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.\nWe are subject to risks related to maintaining appropriate inventory levels.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to effectively maintaining inventory levels. Changes in product demand, product pricing, defective components and other factors can impact the appropriate level of inventories. We attempt to accurately predict these trends in order to avoid shortages, excesses or obsolete inventory. However, any of the factors above may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations.\nIndividual orders for many of our products can be relatively significant and delivery requirements can be sporadic. Accordingly, our operating results for a particular quarter can be materially impacted by the absence or presence of such significant orders.\nThese periodic fluctuations in our operating results could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe face significant competition for our products and services.\nWe have several competitors who provide similar products and services, many of which have substantially greater financial resources than our own. There are also several smaller competitors that, in the aggregate, generate significant revenues from the sale or lease of products similar to those we offer. Some competitors may offer a broader range of instruments and equipment for sale or lease than we do and may offer financing arrangements to customers on terms that we may not be able to match. In addition, new competitors may enter the market and competition could intensify. We cannot assure you that revenue from our products will continue at current volumes or prices if current competitors or new market entrants introduce new products with better features, performance, price or other characteristics than our products. Competitive pressures or other factors may also result in significant price competition that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur revenues are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our control, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in a given financial period.\nProjects awarded to and scheduled by our customers can be delayed or canceled due to factors that are outside of their control, which can affect the demand for our products and services. These factors include the following:\n\u2022inclement weather conditions, natural disasters or pandemics, including the recent global pandemic;\n\u2022difficulties in obtaining permits and licenses;\n\u2022labor or political unrest;\n\u2022delays in obtaining access rights;\n\u2022availability of required equipment;\n\u2022security concerns;\n\u2022budgetary or financial issues;\n\u2022macroeconomic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022delays in payments to our customers from their clients.\nCapital requirements for our business strategy can be large. If we are unable to finance these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage or execute our strategy.\nWe have historically funded our capital requirements with cash generated from operations, cash reserves, issuance of preferred and common stock and proceeds from the sale of assets. Our capital requirements may continue to increase. If we were to expand our operations at a rate exceeding operating cash flow, or current demand or pricing of our services were to decrease substantially or if technical advances or competitive pressures required us to acquire new equipment faster than our cash flow could sustain, additional financing could be required. Access to global financial markets and the terms under which capital is available can be uncertain and volatile. Furthermore, due to the historically cyclical nature of the energy business in general, and the seismic industry in particular, capital for businesses in this industry can be even more difficult and expensive to obtain.\nOn May 5, 2020, the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Klein (collectively, the \u201cBorrowers\u201d), were granted loans (the \u201cLoans\u201d or \u201cPPP Loans\u201d) from Bank of America, N.A. in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.6 million, pursuant to the Small Business Association's Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d), a component of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act which was enacted on March 27, 2020. Under the terms of the PPP, funds from the Loans may only be used for payroll costs, rent, utilities and interest on other debt obligations incurred prior to February 15, 2020. In addition, certain amounts of the Loan may be forgiven if the funds are used to pay qualifying expenses. In January 2021, we received confirmation that 100% of the PPP Loan granted to the Company had been forgiven and in February 2021 we received confirmation that 100% of the PPP Loan granted to Klein had been forgiven. See Note 13 - \u201cNotes Payable\u201d to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nThrough January 31, 2021, we have issued 1,038,232 shares of 9.00% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d). As of January 31, 2021, under our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, we had 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. We cannot predict the availability, size or price of any future issuances of preferred or common stock or other instruments convertible into equity, and the effect, if any, that such future issuances and sales will have on the market price of our securities. Any additional issuances of preferred or common stock or securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, such stock may ultimately result in dilution to the holders of stock, dilution in our future earnings per share and may have a material adverse effect upon the market price of the stock of the Company.\nDue to these factors, we cannot be certain that funding will be available if and when needed and to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to grow our existing business, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccess to working capital and letters of credit may be limited.\nFrom time to time, we may require access to working capital to meet overhead costs and operational expenditures, finance inventory purchases, to provide letters of credit or bankers\u2019 guarantees to certain customers. For the past several years we have not had a credit facility in place, and have used cash generated from our operations, sale of lease pool equipment and sale of our Series A preferred stock to meet our working capital needs. There is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate a credit facility or continue to meet working capital needs with cash generated from our operations, sale of lease pool equipment or sale of our Series A preferred stock or common stock. Many commercial banks in the United States have undertaken to reduce their exposure to companies engaged in oil and gas related activities, which f limits our ability to obtain working capital financing. Should we not have access to adequate working capital financing, we may not be able to pursue or complete some business opportunities or maintain and appropriate level of working capital to meet our overhead costs and operational expenditures. Further, our failure to meet our projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows could lead to cash flow and working capital constraints that could limit our ability to meet the day-to-day needs of our business. If our cash flows and capital\nresources are insufficient to fund our operations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, or seek additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our inability to generate or access working capital could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur long-lived assets may be subject to impairment.\nWe periodically assess our long-lived assets and other intangible assets for impairment. If the future cash flows anticipated to be generated from these assets falls below net book value, we may be required to write down the value of our long-lived assets. If we are forced to write down the value of our long-lived assets, these noncash asset impairments could negatively affect our results of operations in the period in which they are recorded. In fiscal 2021 and 2020 we recognized impairment charges of approximately $2.5 million and $760,000, respectively, related to certain intangible assets. See the discussion included in Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Long-Lived Assets.\u201d\nEnactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES\u201d Act) and final regulations relating to and interpretations of provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) may vary from our current interpretation of such legislation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United States federal income tax legislation enacted (i) on March 27, 2020, commonly referred to as the CARES Act, and (ii) on December 22, 2017, commonly referred to as the TCJA, are highly complex and subject to interpretation. The presentation of our financial position and results of operations is based upon our current interpretation of the provisions contained in both the CARES Act and the TCJA. In the future, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service could issue final regulations and additional interpretive guidance with respect to the provisions of the CARES Act and TCJA. Any significant variance of our current interpretation of such provisions from any future final regulations or interpretive guidance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery statutes, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and the UK Bribery Act of 2010 (the \u201cUK Bribery Act\u201d), could result in fines, criminal penalties, and other sanctions, and may adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe FCPA and the UK Bribery Act, and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We and our local partners operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. If we are found to be liable for violations under the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act or other similar laws, either due to our acts or omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others, including our local or strategic partners, we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, investors could negatively view potential violations, inquiries or allegations of misconduct under the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act or similar laws, which could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our shares. We also may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or using other methods that U.S. law and regulations prohibit us from using.\nWe could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions or the seizure of assets. We could face other third party claims by agents, stockholders, debt holders, or other interest holders or constituents of our company. Further, disclosure of the subject matter of any investigation could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business from potential customers or retain existing business from our current customers, to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets. Our customers in relevant jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests, and we may be required to dedicate significant time and resources to investigate and resolve allegations of misconduct, regardless of the merit of such allegations.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations that could increase our costs of compliance and impose significant liabilities.\nWe are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations both in the United States and in foreign countries relating to worker safety and health, protection of the environment and natural resources, and the handling of chemicals and materials used in our manufacturing processes as well as the recycling and disposal of wastes generated by those processes. For additional information regarding costs and liabilities associated with environmental or worker safety and health matters, see Item 1 - \u201cRegulation - Governmental and Environmental Regulation.\u201d Compliance with or continuing to be subject to these applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, increased environmental regulation of oil and gas exploration and production activities, whether in the United States or in any of the other countries in which our customers operate could cause them to incur increased costs or restrict, delay or cancel drilling, exploration or production programs or associated hydraulic fracturing activities, which in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nUse of our equipment in marine environments may be regulated or require a permit or other authorization from United States or foreign governmental agencies. The implementation of new or more restrictive laws or regulatory requirements to protect marine species, or the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered, could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products or services.\nClimate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in reduced demand for oil and natural gas, thereby adversely affecting our business, while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our manufacturing of equipment and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn the United States, the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d), in addition to some state and regional authorities, have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d). These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting, permitting, and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislation, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the U.S. Clean Air Act and may require the installation of \u201cbest available control technology\u201d to limit emissions of GHGs from certain new or significantly modified facilities emitting large volumes of GHGs together with other criteria pollutants. In addition, the EPA has adopted regulations requiring monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources, including, among others, certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities. In 2016, the EPA finalized new regulations that set emission standards for methane and other volatile organic compounds for new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities, known as New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d) Subpart OOOOa. Although EPA subsequently withdrew these requirements for certain sectors of the oil and gas industry, and the ultimate scope of these rules is uncertain due to ongoing court challenges of the rules and any potential changes to the rules by U.S. President Biden\u2019s Administration, the bulk of NSPS Subpart OOOOa is currently in effect. Also, many of the other countries where we and our customers operate, including Canada and various countries in Europe, have adopted or are considering GHG reduction measures similar to those described above. Such measures, or any similar future proposals, have the potential to increase costs for the oil and gas industry, which in turn could result in reduced demand for the products and services we provide. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations or other initiatives that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws, regulations or other legal requirements imposing reporting or permitting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from oil and gas exploration and production activities could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and services.\nIn addition, spurred by increasing concerns regarding climate change, the oil and gas industry faces growing demand for corporate transparency and a demonstrated commitment to sustainability goals. Environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) goals and programs, which typically include extralegal targets related to environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and corporate governance, have become an increasing focus of investors and shareholders across the industry. While reporting on ESG metrics remains voluntary, access to capital and investors is likely to favor companies with robust ESG programs in place. Ultimately, these initiatives could increase operational costs and make it more difficult for companies, including our current and potential customers, to secure funding for exploration and production activities and, thus, reduce demand for our products and services.\nFinally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, hurricanes, floods, drought and other climatic events. If any such climatic events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and the financial condition and operations of our customers. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that oil and gas will continue to represent a substantial major share of global energy use through 2030, and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector.\nThe results of the 2020 U.S. presidential and congressional elections may create regulatory uncertainty for our industry. Changes in environmental laws could increase costs and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nJoe Biden's victory in the U.S. presidential election, as well as a closely divided Congress, may create regulatory uncertainty in our industry. During his first weeks in office, President Biden has issued several executive orders promoting various programs and initiatives designed to, among other things, curtail climate change and control the release of methane. It remains unclear what additional actions President Biden will take and what support he will have for any potential legislative changes from Congress. Further, it is uncertain to what extent any new environmental laws or regulations, or any repeal of existing environmental laws or regulations, may affect the operations of our customers and the demand for our products. While management believes our international footprint helps minimize the impact of any regional or country-specific impact, such actions could increase our operating costs, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to conduct and protect our business. As a result, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the security of our facilities, and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security\nthreats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSince the outbreak of the global pandemic and continuing through the beginning of fiscal 2022, we have allowed our employees to work from home according to shelter in place rules put forth by their local governments. As a result, we may have increased cybersecurity and data security risks, due to increased use of home Wi-Fi networks and virtual private networks. The United States Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has warned that cybercriminals will take advantage of the disruption and uncertainty created by the global pandemic in their cyberattacks. While we continue to implement information technology controls to reduce the risk of a cybersecurity or data security breach, there is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard all systems with an increased number of employees working remotely.\nCybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, disruption of our customers\u2019 operations, loss or damage to our data delivery systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as advanced persistent threats, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches. Although we have taken measures to prevent cybersecurity attacks and respond to cyber incidents, these measures may not be sufficient to prevent or recover from cyberattacks or information security breaches. Although we maintain insurance coverage to protect against cybersecurity risks, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks. These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, increased protection costs, regulatory action or potential liability.\nOur business could be negatively affected by data protection and privacy laws that carry fines and may expose us to criminal sanctions and civil suits.\nSeveral jurisdictions in which we operate (including certain U.S. states, Europe and Canada) may have laws governing how we must respond to a cyber incident that results in the unauthorized access, disclosure or loss of personal data. Additionally, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including international comprehensive data privacy regulations such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and recent California legislation (which, among other things, provides for a private right of action), pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and could potentially elevate our costs over time. Although our business does not involve large-scale processing of personal information, our business involves collection, uses and other processing of personal data of our employees, contractors, suppliers and service providers. As legislation continues to develop and cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will likely be required to expend significant resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures to comply with such legislation and to detect, investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cyber incidents. Any failure by us, or a company we acquire, to comply with such laws and regulations could result in reputational harm, loss of goodwill, penalties, liabilities and/or mandated changes in our business practices.\nWe may grow through acquisitions and our failure to properly plan and manage those acquisitions may adversely affect our performance.\nWe plan to expand not only through organic growth but may also do so through the strategic acquisition of companies and assets. We must plan and manage any acquisitions effectively to achieve revenue growth and maintain profitability in our evolving market. If we fail to manage acquisitions effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, significant demands on our personnel, management and other resources. We must continue to improve our operational, financial, management, legal compliance and information systems to keep pace with the growth of our business.\nAny future acquisitions could present a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets;\n\u2022unknown liabilities or other unforeseen obligations of any company we may acquire, which may not be identified in the course of or due diligence;\n\u2022failure to integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets successfully and timely;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations or other priorities;\n\u2022increased competition for acquisition opportunities, in turn increasing our cost of making further acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making additional acquisitions; and\n\u2022our inability to secure sufficient financing, on terms we find acceptable, that may be required for any such acquisition or investment.\nIn addition, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or strategic investment opportunities. We may incur expenses associated with sourcing, evaluating and negotiating acquisitions (including those that we do not complete), and we may also pay fees and expenses associated with financing acquisitions to investment banks and other advisors. Any of these amounts may be substantial, and together with the size, timing and number of acquisitions we pursue, may negatively affect and cause significant volatility in our financial results.\nEncountering any of these or any unforeseen problems in completing acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete, financial condition and results of operations, and could prevent us from achieving the increases in revenues and profitability that we hope to realize through acquisitions.\nOur failure to properly develop and manage strategic initiatives may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe have initiated, and may in the future initiate, strategic initiatives in order to focus and expand our product offerings. The initiatives we have initiated include (i) the development of side-scan sonar systems specifically for unmanned vehicles, including integration of our MA-XTM technology; (ii) the development of SAS sonar systems in cooperation with a major European defense contractor; (iii) the application of our SeaLink solid streamer technology to passive sonar arrays for use in maritime security applications, such as anti-submarine warfare; and (iv) disposition of our Leasing Business. There can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such initiatives or that any of the strategic initiatives will ultimately have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. The pursuit of the strategic initiatives presents a number of risks, including but not limited to, the length of development, increased competition, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations or other priorities, the unavailability of equipment, budget limitations and the ability to sell our lease pool equipment on favorable terms, if at all, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Global Pandemic\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the recent spread of COVID-19 or novel coronavirus, or fear of such an event.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by the global pandemic. The global pandemic has impacted countries and communities where we have facilities and employees, as well as those where our suppliers and customers have operations. We are continuing to monitor the situation and take the steps deemed necessary to mitigate risks to us, our employees, business associates and communities.\nWe were required to temporarily shut-down our facilities in Malaysia and Singapore on March 17, 2020 and April 7, 2020, respectively. The Malaysia facility was reopened on April 21, 2020 with approximately 50% of its normal staff and resumed operations with 100% of its employees on May 4, 2020. In Singapore, we were able to continue limited shipping and receiving operations during the shutdown and were able to resume manufacturing operations on June 1, 2020. Both facilities continue to operate at essentially full capacity. However, the ability of management to travel between Singapore and Malaysia continues to be restricted.\nOur other facilities have been allowed to operate, although at reduced efficiencies as certain employees have worked remotely. Furthermore, travel restrictions resulting from the global pandemic have impacted our ability to visit customers, conduct product demonstrations and visit our various operating locations. These disruptions have had, and we expect they will continue to have, a negative effect on our business; however, the duration and magnitude of these disruptions are uncertain. We cannot predict whether there will be additional closures at any of our facilities, or other interruptions or impact to our business activities from the spread of global pandemic. Furthermore, our reliance on third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers, and service providers exposes us to possibility of further delay or interruption of our operations. We are unable to accurately predict the continuing impact that the global pandemic will have on our business due to various uncertainties, including the severity and transmission rate of the virus and any new variants of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the long-term efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in the countries and communities where we, our suppliers, or our customers have operations the impact of these and other factors on our employees, suppliers and customers.\nFurthermore, the global pandemic also raises the possibility of an extended global economic downturn and has caused volatility in financial markets, which could affect demand for our products and impact our financial condition and results of operations even after the pandemic is fully contained. For example, if a customer\u2019s financial difficulties become severe, the customer may be unwilling or unable to pay our invoices in the ordinary course of business, which could adversely affect collections of both our accounts receivable and unbilled services. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our cash flows and on the credit and financial markets.\nIf there are extended or additional facility closures, or other interruptions to our business, including as a result of impact on third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers and service providers, related to the global pandemic, such disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisk Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is subject to volatility.\nStock prices, including our stock price, have been volatile from time to time. Stock price volatility could adversely affect our business operations by, among other things, impeding our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and to obtain additional financing.\nIn addition to the other risk factors discussed in this section, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:\n\u2022operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors or analysts consider comparable to us;\n\u2022announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest rates, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets.\nTo the extent that the price of our common stock remains at lower levels or it declines further, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or otherwise use our common stock as consideration will be reduced. In addition, increases in our leverage may make it more difficult for us to access additional capital. These factors may limit our ability to implement our operating and growth plans\nWe may not be able to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\nThe standards for continued listing on NASDAQ include, among other things, that the minimum bid price for the listed securities not fall below $1.00 for a period in excess of thirty consecutive business days. During the months of March, April, and May of 2020 our common stock periodically traded at levels below $1.00 per share, but never for thirty consecutive days. Subsequently, the price recovered from those levels. However, if the closing bid price of our common stock were to fail to meet NASDAQ\u2019s minimum closing bid price requirement, or if we otherwise fail to meet any other applicable requirements of NASDAQ and we are unable to regain compliance, NASDAQ may make a determination to delist our common stock. The delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ could negatively impact us by (i) reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; (ii) reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; (iii) impacting our ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities, thereby preventing or limiting us from accessing the public capital markets; and (iv) impairing our ability to provide equity incentives to our employees.\nBecause we do not currently pay any dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings attributable to our common stock to support our operations and growth. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be dependent on the amount of funds legally available, our financial condition, capital requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nWe may issue debt or equity securities with rights senior to that of our common stock in liquidation which could dilute or negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nAs of January 31, 2021, 1,038,232 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. The Company has 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized. The preferred stock may be issued in multiple series with various terms, as authorized by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. The Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference senior to that of our common stock. In order to raise additional capital, in the future, we may issue other debt securities or equity securities with a liquidation preference senior to that of our common stock. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities could receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. The issuance of these securities could dilute or negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Delaware law could discourage a takeover attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and, therefore, the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares for a premium.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and the Delaware General Corporation Law may tend to delay, defer or prevent a potential unsolicited offer or takeover attempt that is not approved by our board of directors but that our stockholders might consider to be in\ntheir best interest, including an attempt that might result in stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their shares. Because our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock with preferences and rights as it determines, it may afford the holders of any series of preferred stock preferences, rights or voting powers superior to those of the holders of common stock.\nIn addition, we are governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to some specified exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock, for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Section 203 could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our financial results.\nIt is management\u2019s responsibility to establish and maintain effective internal control in order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the financial reporting soundness for external purposes. Internal control over financial reporting is not intended to impart absolute assurance that the Company can prevent or detect misstatements of its financial statement or fraud due to its inherent limitations.\nAs of January 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s executive officers determined that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to an identified material weakness. The material weakness involved the Company\u2019s review controls over significant estimates. The Company failed to detect an error related to our provision for doubtful accounts identified by the Company\u2019s auditors during the audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. During fiscal 2021 management implemented certain remediation procedures and as of January 31, 2021, management has determined that such controls are effective.\nA material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If the current material weakness is not remediated, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and the Company could be required to restate its financial results. The failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the Company\u2019s ability to report its financial results accurately and in a timely manner or to detect and prevent fraud and could also cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. See further discussion of the material weakness, including the Company's planned remediation procedures, in Item 9A.- \"Controls and Procedures.\"", "PERMNO": 81165, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "MIND"}
