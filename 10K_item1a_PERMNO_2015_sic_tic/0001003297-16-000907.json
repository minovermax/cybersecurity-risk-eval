RISK FACTORS\nWe have a history of losses and negative cash flow from operations. We cannot assure you that we will sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations in recent prior years. We reported net income of approximately $0.6 million and incurred a net loss of approximately $1.4 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and had net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $0.8 million and net cash used in operating activities of approximately $2.0 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Further, we may incur net losses in future reporting periods as we incur expenses associated with the continuation of our business as well as its subsequent development, which development cannot be guaranteed. There is no assurance our future operations will continue to be profitable. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably, we may be forced to cease or suspend operations, or we may be required to raise capital to maintain or grow our operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital.\nWhile we believe that our existing cash resources are sufficient to support our growth strategy, there can be no assurances that our growth strategy will be successful or that we will earn a return on these investments.\nOur business remains highly concentrated in our Diabetic Products Line. If our Diabetic Products Line were to suffer the loss of a principal customer or a material decline in or loss of revenues, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nRevenues of Diabetic Products to OEM customers accounted for approximately 88% of net revenues from continuing operations in Fiscal 2016. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations are subject to higher risk from the loss of a major Diabetic Products customer or changes in their business practices, for example, recently a new diabetes monitoring product has been brought to the market which does not use a carrying case. If our customers use new solutions in their diabetes product lines that do not use carrying cases, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe loss of any of, or a material reduction in orders from, our largest customers, would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is and has been characterized by a high degree of customer concentration. Our four largest customers accounted for approximately 88% and 82% of net revenues from continuing operations in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, respectively. The loss of any of these customers, whether as a result of its purchase of its carry solution requirements from another vendor, its decision to manufacture its own carrying cases, its decision to award its orders to one of our competitors, or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nIf any one or more of our OEM customers elect to reduce or discontinue inclusion of cases \u201cin box\u201d, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe predominant percentage of our revenues is derived from sales of case accessories to our OEM customers who package our cases \u201cin box\u201d with their electronics. During recent years, there have been numerous federal legislative and administrative actions that have affected government programs, including adjustments that have reduced or increased payments to healthcare providers and patients. For example, the federal healthcare reform legislation that was enacted in March 2010 (known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (\u201cACA\u201d)) may reduce reimbursement for some healthcare providers and patients while increasing reimbursement for others. In addition, ACA mandates the implementation of various programs and value and quality-based reimbursement incentives that may impact the amount of reimbursement for healthcare providers and patients. In addition and more significantly, third-party payers, including governmental health administration authorities, managed care providers and private health insurers, have increasingly challenged the price and examined the cost effectiveness of medical products and services, which has affected the reimbursement of such products to patients. Due to this uncertainty in medical reimbursements, OEMs have experienced reductions in demand and, as a result, have sought continuously to reduce expenses. Additionally, it is uncertain what impact the election of Donald Trump as President will have on health care spending in light of his campaign promise to repeal the ACA. If enacted and implemented, any measures to restrict health care spending could result in decreased sales of our products. If one or more of our OEM customers generally begin to reduce or discontinue the practice of including carry case accessories \u201cin box\u201d or if our customers experience reduced demand for their products as a result of political changes, we may incur a significant decline in our revenues and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nIf President-elect Donald Trump follows through with his threats to put significant tariffs or other restrictions on Chinese imports, our revenues and results of operations be may materially harmed.\nDonald Trump\u2019s victory in the U.S. presidential election, as well as the Republican Party maintaining control of both the House of Representatives and Senate of the United States in the congressional election, has created uncertainty with how trade would be affected between China and the United States. During the election campaign, President-elect Trump made threats regarding cutting off trade with China and/or imposing a tariff on all imports from China. If any such restrictions or tariffs are imposed on products that we import to our customers, we would be required to raise our prices which may result in the loss of customers and harm our business.\nWe continue to encounter pressures from our largest OEM customers to maintain or even decrease prices or to supply lower priced carry solutions, and expect such pressure to persist. The effects of such price constraints on our business may be exacerbated by inflationary pressures that affect our costs of supply.\nDuring Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, we experienced significant pricing pressure from our largest OEM customers to maintain or even reduce the prices we charge them. When we are unable to extract comparable concessions from our suppliers on prices they charge us, our product sales margins erode. In addition, competitors may reduce their average selling prices faster than we are able to reduce costs, which can also accelerate the rate of decline of our selling prices.\nIn addition to margin compression from customers in general, we are encountering increased pricing from our Chinese suppliers who are reacting to inflationary increases in materials and labor costs incurred by them. In addition, prices that our Chinese vendors charge to us may reflect appreciation of the Chinese currency against the U.S. dollar, which can be passed through to us in the form of higher U.S. dollar prices. This in turn will tend to reduce gross profit if we are unable to raise our prices. Any decrease in demand for our products, coupled with pressure from the market and our customers to decrease our prices, would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIncreasingly, our customers are requesting that we enter into supply agreements with them that have restrictive terms and conditions. These agreements typically include provisions that increase our financial exposure, which could result in significant costs to us.\nIncreasingly, our customers are requesting that we enter into supply agreements with them. These agreements typically do not include volume commitments, but do include provisions that generally serve to increase our exposure for product liability and limited sales returns, which could result in higher costs to us as a result of such claims. In addition, these agreements typically contain provisions that seek to limit our operational and pricing flexibility and extend payment terms, which could materially adversely affect our cash flow, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on a single exclusive buying agent who, in turn, depends on a limited number of key suppliers.\nOur Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and largest shareholder is a principal of Forward China, our exclusive sourcing agent in the Asia Pacific region. We have entered into a Buying Agency and Supply Agreement with Forward China whereby Forward China will act as the Company\u2019s exclusive agent to arrange for sourcing, manufacturing and exporting the Company\u2019s products. Forward China has relied on a limited number of suppliers to supply the component parts and pieces necessary for the production of our carry and protective solutions products. As a result, our ability to effectively push back against rising material costs may diminish. In addition, any inability to obtain supplies from a single or limited number of suppliers may result in difficulty obtaining the supplies necessary for our business and may restrict our ability to produce our carry and protective solutions products. Where practical, we intend to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or the failure of one of our suppliers could impair our ability to ship products and generate revenues, which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships.\nIn addition, we depend significantly on Forward China as our exclusive buying agent for substantially all of our component parts. As a result, we have limited visibility as to our supplier base, making it difficult to forecast future events and to plan our operations. In addition, if Forward China fails to satisfactorily perform its obligations, including payment obligations, to our suppliers or its duties to us as our exclusive buying agent as a result of financial or other difficulties or for any other reason, or if our relationship with Forward China were to suffer, we could suffer irreparable harm resulting in substantial harm to the business.\nOur business has benefited from OEMs deciding to outsource their carry and protective solutions assembly needs to us. If OEMs choose to provide these services in-house or select other providers, our business could suffer.\nOur future revenue growth partially depends on new outsourcing opportunities from OEMs. Current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our performance against other providers. They also evaluate the potential benefits of manufacturing their products themselves. To the extent that outsourcing opportunities are not available either due to OEM decisions to produce these products themselves or to use other providers, our financial results and future growth could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to provide our customers with high-quality products, and responsive service, or if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn order to maintain our existing customer base and obtain business from new OEM customers, we must demonstrate our ability to produce our products at the level of quality, responsiveness of service, timeliness of delivery, and cost that our customers require. If our products are of substandard quality, if they are not delivered on time, if we are not responsive to our customers\u2019 demands, or if we cannot meet our customers\u2019 requirements, our reputation as a reliable supplier of our products would likely be damaged. If we are unable to meet anticipated product and service standards, we may be unable to obtain new contracts or keep our existing customers, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot maintain effective controls and reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed. We continue to work on improvements to our internal controls over financial reporting. Any failure to implement and maintain internal controls over our financial reporting or difficulties encountered in the implementation of improvements in our controls, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure to improve our internal controls over financial reporting or to address identified weaknesses in the future, if they were to occur, could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may experience growth in the scope and complexity of our operations. This growth may strain our managerial, financial, manufacturing, and other resources. In order to manage our growth, we may be required to continue to implement additional operating and financial controls and hire and train additional personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future, and failure to do so could jeopardize our expansion plans and seriously harm our operations.\nOur results of operations are subject to the risks of fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar.\nOur results of operations are expressed in U.S. dollars. When the U.S. dollar appreciates or depreciates in value against a currency in which all or a significant portion of revenues or other accounts receivable are denominated, such as the Euro, our results of operations can be adversely affected or benefited, respectively. The degree of impact is proportional to the amount of foreign currency expense or revenue, as the case may be, and the fluctuations in exchange rates over the period in which the effect is measured on our financial statements. In addition, such currency fluctuations may affect the comparability of our results of operations between financial periods.\nFuture revenues are difficult to predict and are likely to show significant variability as a consequence of customer concentration.\nBecause our revenues are highly concentrated in a few large customers, and because the volumes of these customers\u2019 order flows to us can fluctuate markedly in a short period of time, our quarterly revenues, and consequently our results of operations, may be highly variable and subject to significant changes over a relatively short period of time. Our largest OEM customers may keep consumer products with which our carry solutions are packaged \u201cin-box\u201d in active promotion for many months, or for a very short period of time, depending on various factors, including sales trends for the product, product development cycles, new product introductions, and our customers' competitors' product offerings. As demand for the consumer product relating to the in-box program matures and decreases, we may be forced to accept significant price and/or volume reductions in customer orders for our carry solutions, which will adversely affect revenues. These factors tend to lead to a high degree of variability in our quarterly revenue levels. Significant, rapid shifts in our operating results may occur if and when one or more of these customers increases or decreases the size(s) of, or eliminates, their orders from us by amounts that are material to our business.\nOur gross margins, and therefore our profitability, vary considerably by customer and by product, and if the revenue contribution from one or more OEM customers or products changes materially, relative to total revenues, our gross profit percentage may fluctuate.\nOur gross profit margins on the products we sell can vary widely depending on the product type, customer, and order size. Because of the broad variability in price ranges and product types, we anticipate that gross margins, and accordingly their impact on operating income or loss, may fluctuate depending on the relative revenue contribution from each customer or product. If our gross margins decrease, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nProduct manufacture is often outsourced by our OEM customers to contract manufacturing firms in China and in these cases it is the contract manufacturer to which we must look for payment.\nContract manufacturing firms are performing manufacturing, assembly, and product packaging functions, including the bundling of our product accessories with the OEM customer's product. As a consequence of this business practice, we often sell our carry solution products directly to the contract manufacturing firm. This is particularly significant in the case of diabetic product sales to certain customers. In these cases, we invoice the contract manufacturing firm and not the OEM customer. Therefore, it is the contract manufacturing firm to which we must look for payment in such cases and not that of our OEM customer. This may alter the credit profile of our customer base and may involve significant purchase order volumes.\nOur dependence on foreign manufacturers creates quality control and other risks to our business. From time to time we may experience certain quality control, on-time delivery, cost, or other issues that may jeopardize customer relationships.\nOur reliance on foreign suppliers, manufacturers and other contractors involves significant risks, including risk of product quality issues and reduced control over quality assurance, manufacturing yields and costs, pricing, timely delivery schedules, the potential lack of adequate manufacturing capacity and availability of product, the lack of capital and potential misappropriation of our designs. In any such event, our reputation and our business will be harmed.\nOur shipments of products via container may become subject to delays or cancellation due to work stoppages or slowdowns, piracy, damage to port facilities caused by weather or terrorism, and congestion due to inadequacy of port terminal equipment and other causes.\nTo the extent that there are disruptions or delays in loading container cargo in ports of origin or off-loading cargo at ports of destination as a result of labor disputes, work-rules related slowdowns, tariff or World Trade Organization-related disputes, piracy, physical damage to port terminal facilities or equipment caused by severe weather or terrorist incidents, congestion in port terminal facilities, inadequate equipment to load, dock and offload container vessels or energy-related tie-ups or otherwise, or for other reasons, product shipments to our customers will be delayed. In any such case, our customer may cancel or change the terms of its purchase order, resulting in a cancellation or delay of payments to us. A closure or partial closure of port facilities or other causes of delays in the loading, importation, offloading or movement of our products to the shipping destination agreed with our customer could result in increased expenses, as we try to avoid such delays, delayed shipments or cancelled orders, or all of the above. Depending on the severity of such consequences, this may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe OEM carrying solutions business is highly competitive and does not pose significant barriers to entry.\nThere are many competitors in the sale of carry solutions products to OEMs, and competition is intense. Since little or no significant proprietary technology is involved in the design, production or distribution of the types of products we sell, others may enter the business with relative ease and compete against us. Such competition may result in the diminution of our market share or the loss of one or more major OEM customers, thereby adversely affecting our net revenues, results of operations, and financial condition. Many of our competitors are larger, better capitalized and more diversified than we are and may be better able to withstand a downturn in the general economy or in the product areas in which we specialize. Potential customers may prefer the pricing terms offered by competitors. These competitors may also have less sales concentration than we do and be better able to withstand the loss of a key customer or diminution in its orders. If we are not effectively able to compete, our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur business could suffer if the services of key sales personnel we rely on were lost to us.\nWe are highly dependent on the efforts and services of certain key sales representatives who have account responsibility for, and have longstanding relationships with one or more of our largest customers. Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we lost the services of any such individual. If we lost the services of a key sales representative, we might experience a material reduction in orders from his customers, resulting in a loss of revenues, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe maintain cash balances in our bank accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limitation.\nWe maintain our cash assets at commercial banks in the U.S. in amounts in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit of $250,000 and in Europe in amounts that may exceed any applicable deposit insurance limits. In the event of a failure at a commercial bank where we maintain our deposits or uninsured losses on money market or other cash equivalents in which we maintain cash balances, we may incur a loss to the extent such loss exceeds the insurance limitation, which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial conditions and our results of operations.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is a significant shareholder, which makes it possible for him to have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval and which influence may be alleged to conflict with our interests and the interests of our other shareholders.\nTerence Wise, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is a significant shareholder who beneficially owns approximately 18.3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 9, 2016. Mr. Wise has substantial influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of our directors and other corporate actions. This influence may be alleged to conflict with our interests and the interests of our other shareholders. In 2014, Mr. Wise successfully launched a proxy contest to elect a different slate of directors than what our Company proposed to shareholders. In addition, such influence by Mr. Wise could have the effect of discouraging potential business partners or create actual or perceived governance instabilities that could adversely affect the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 37381, "SIC": 3100, "TIC": "FORD"}
