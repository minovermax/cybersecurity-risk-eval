{"cik": "1364099", "company": "Innophos Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains \"forward-looking statements,\" as discussed in the Forward-Looking Statements section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Investing in Innophos involves a significant degree of risk. We are providing the following cautionary discussion of risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are relevant to our business. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and our forward-looking statements. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider this section to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may substantially impact our business. Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nRaw Materials Availability and Pricing - Significant raw material shortages, supplier concentration, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality and sourcing issues or price increases could increase our operating costs or curtail our ability to manufacture products and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to source sufficient amounts of the raw materials used in our products at competitive prices. Our principal raw materials consist of phosphate rock, sulfur and sulfuric acid, MGA, PPA and energy (principally natural gas and electricity). Our raw materials are purchased under supply contracts that vary from long term multi-year supply arrangements to annual agreements. We also rely on spot suppliers. Pricing within contracts is typically set according to predetermined formulae dependent on price indices or market prices with pricing for some shorter term contracts set by negotiation with reference to market conditions. The prices we pay under these contracts will generally lag the underlying market prices of the raw material. Approximately 25% of our supply of these principal raw materials is bought under fixed annual pricing arrangements. Pricing for our remaining supply of raw materials typically adjusts in line with changes in market prices or with approximately a three month lag to market price changes. We cannot be sure that the annual or other periodic contracts we have in place for our raw materials can be renewed at all or on similar terms to the current terms.\nVarious market conditions can affect the price and supply of our raw materials. The primary demand for both phosphate rock and sulfur, globally, is for fertilizer production. The costs of these materials are heavily influenced by demand conditions in the fertilizer market and freight costs, which historically have been volatile. Prices for both materials escalated rapidly during 2007 and 2008, declined during 2009, began to increase again through 2011, subsequently declined again through 2013, and generally remained steady in 2014 and 2015. Increased raw material pricing may adversely affect our margins if we are not able to offset costs with sales price increases. See \u201cCompetition - The success of our business depends on our ability to successfully compete in extremely competitive markets\u201d below.\nWe import phosphate rock for our Coatzacoalcos, Mexico site from multiple global suppliers. We are currently capable of successfully processing industrial scale quantities of phosphate rock from five separate suppliers and, for 2016, we expect the majority of our requirements to be met from two of these suppliers. Although the Coatzacoalcos facility is able to handle alternative grades of rock without adversely affecting operating efficiency, further investment may be required to realize the full benefits of improved process flexibility. Process efficiency issues may arise over longer time periods as the plant processes rock from various sources, necessitating further investment or changes in rock suppliers to maintain and improve our current plant processing capabilities or to meet evolving needs. We cannot be sure that efficiency issues will not arise, or if they do, that our existing or other suppliers would be able to supply sufficient additional quantities or grades to meet our full requirements, which may weaken our ability to maintain our existing levels of operations. Although the diversification of our phosphate rock supply base has reduced our dependence on any one supplier, tight demand conditions overall in the fertilizer market would mean that our purchases could be constrained should any major supplier experience a significant disruption in its ability to supply, for example, as a result of capacity constraints, political unrest, or adverse weather conditions in the areas where that supplier operates.\nNatural gas prices have experienced significant volatility in the past several years. Wide fluctuations in natural gas prices may result from relatively minor changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, and other factors, both domestic and foreign, that are beyond our control. In addition, natural gas is often a substitute for petroleum-based energy supplies and natural gas prices are positively correlated with petroleum prices. Future increases in the price of petroleum (resulting from increased demand, political instability or other factors) may result in significant additional increases in the price of natural gas. We typically purchase\nPage 13 of 84\nnatural gas at spot market prices for use at our facilities, which exposes us to that price volatility, except in those instances where, from time to time, we enter into longer term, fixed-price natural gas contracts.\nMost of our raw materials are supplied to us by either one or a small number of suppliers. Some of those suppliers rely, in turn, on sole or limited sources of supply for raw materials included in their products. Failure of our suppliers to maintain sufficient capability to meet changes in demand or quality, or to overcome unanticipated interruptions in their own sources of supply due to their own supplier\u2019s performance failures or force majeure conditions, such as disaster or political unrest, may prevent them from continuing to supply raw materials as we require them, or at all. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of sole or limited source raw materials or to develop alternative sources on a timely basis if required could result in increased costs, which may be material, in our operations or our inability to properly maintain our existing level of operations.\nCompetition - The success of our business depends on our ability to successfully compete in extremely competitive markets.\nWe face significant competition in each of our markets. In some markets, our products are subject to price pressure due to factors such as competition from low-cost producers, import competition and regulation, transaction risks associated with foreign currency exchange fluctuations, excess industry capacity and consolidation among our customers and competitors. These developments, and particularly future expansions by one or more competitors, have had and are expected to continue to have a negative effect on our pricing abilities. Our operations are subject to currency fluctuation transaction risks. We may from time to time be at a competitive disadvantage as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which can place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to our foreign competitors selling competing products into the markets to which we sell our products. We believe that the strength of the U.S. Dollar in 2015 had a negative impact our competitive position and our revenues, and we believe that a strong U.S. Dollar will continue to have a negative impact our competitive position and revenues. In addition, in the specialty chemicals industry, price competition is also based upon a number of other considerations, including product differentiation and innovation, product quality, technical service, and supply reliability. Thus, new products or technologies developed by competitors may also have an adverse impact on our pricing capability. Our competitors continue to seek to develop improvements to the purified wet acid method to produce PPA, the method utilized by Innophos, which, if developed, may hurt our competitive position. In addition, new technologies are being developed to attempt to produce PPA at a cheaper cost than the thermal acid method or the purified wet acid method, including a kiln-based thermal method. Any such new or improved technology that is developed would be expected to reduce the barriers to entry and/or significantly increase competition in the markets in which we compete, all of which would be expected to harm our competitive position and our business. Although we have a number of product quality improvement and product enhancement initiatives underway, we cannot assure that our efforts in maintaining differentiation will be successful.\nFrom time to time, including throughout 2015, we have experienced pricing pressure, particularly from significant customers. In addition, in 2015, we experienced pricing pressure resulting from manufacturing overcapacity outside of North America, including manufacturing overcapacity in China, which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. We have also faced increased pricing pressure as a result of the Chinese government continuing to encourage export activity by rolling over its low export tariff on solid fertilizers and eliminating its export tariff on phosphoric acid, which pressure is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. In the past, we have taken steps to reduce costs, focus on higher margin products and resist possible price reductions by structuring our contracts and developing strong \u201cvalue-oriented\u201d non-price related customer service relationships. However, price reductions in the past, including in 2015, have adversely affected our sales and margins, including the mix between our high margin and low margin products. If we are not able to offset price pressure when it arises through improved operating efficiencies, reduced expenditures, improved product margin mix and other means, we may be subject to those same effects in the future.\nWe have experienced and are continuing to experience more intense pricing pressures in markets, and for applications, where competing producers, particularly those located in China, have similar product offerings, established supply relationships, and potential cost advantages. Historically, this pricing pressure has occurred most frequently in markets such as South America where we do not have local production capability and for less specialized products such as detergent grade STPP. Chinese phosphate producers generally utilize the \u201cthermal\u201d method, a process more heavily dependent on energy that may be cost advantaged compared to \u201cwet\u201d method producers (such as Innophos) during periods of low energy prices, although several producers have arisen in China using the wet process. Both North African and some Chinese producers are integrated back to phosphate rock, which also may provide cost advantages to them depending on the markets in which they choose to compete. The relative competitiveness of Chinese, Russian and North African producers increased in 2015. If the relative competitiveness of competing producers continues to increase, or they are successful in extending their product lines to more specialized product applications, pricing pressure on Innophos could continue to increase significantly, which would negatively impact our sales and margins.\nRegulatory Risks - We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and government policies, including with respect to the environment, which may change in significant ways.\nPage 14 of 84\nOur business is subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. Inability to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our status in these projects and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur operations involve the use, handling, processing, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and some of our products are ingredients in foods, nutritional supplements or pharmaceutical excipients that are used in finished products consumed or used by humans or animals. As a result, we are subject to extensive and frequently changing environmental and other regulatory requirements and periodic inspection by federal, state, and local authorities with jurisdiction over our operations and product markets, including, but not limited to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Customs, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, or OSHA, foreign counterparts to each of the foregoing agencies, and other U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities. Worldwide regulatory trends towards increasing regulation of food safety factors to reduce risks, adoption of increased food defense measures and prevention of economic adulteration of food particular through supply chain management may increase our operating costs.\nMoreover, as we increase operations in foreign jurisdictions, such as China where a new facility was completed in 2012, and export new product into markets where they have not previously been sold, we are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements in jurisdictions that may have unique challenges, or slow processes.\nAdditional laws or regulations focused on phosphate-based products may be implemented in the future. Public perception in the United States, Europe and other markets, which may be driven by public opinions and publications concerning phosphate products in relation to their safety, may affect our sales and operations. Regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions may choose to change recommended daily intake levels for total phosphate in the diet or added phosphates in food. Regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions may choose to no longer allow phosphates as a synthetic ingredient in products labeled with \u201corganic\u201d claims. In addition, U.S. class action trends related to \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cclean labeling\u201d in foods also may affect our sales and operations. Public interest organization spotlighting, through public awareness and publications, regarding the contribution of meat-based diets to phosphate life cycle concerns in the environment may also affect our sales in Europe and other jurisdictions. Additional demand restrictions may arise from producers reformulating to reduce or eliminate phosphate content, as was announced in early 2014 by a major consumer packaged goods manufacturer and in 2015 by several major food chains.\nA number of states within the United States, and Canada (countrywide), have effectively banned the use of phosphate-based products in consumer automatic dishwashing detergents. The trade association that includes major manufacturers of consumer automatic dishwashing detergents has actively supported these efforts in the United States and Canada, with non-phosphate legislation becoming effective in Canada and many states in the United States in July 2010. In addition, the European Union enacted legislation to effectively ban phosphates in consumer detergents with a first phase beginning 2013, and in Australia an industry-led voluntary phosphate ban took effect in 2014. These trends and related changes in consumer preferences have already reduced our requirements for automatic dish markets and we have responded with a shift in our capabilities to serve other food and industrial applications. Furthermore, although phosphates are still permitted for consumer detergent applications in many Latin American countries and other parts of the world, we cannot be sure that similar bans may not be implemented in some or all of these markets in the future or that additional customers will not reformulate their products to reduce STPP content in an effort to market a reduced phosphate content product line. We expect some detergent grade STPP reformulation in 2016, which will adversely effect our financial results.\nAdditional laws, regulations or distribution policies focused on reduced use of other phosphate-based products could occur in the future. For example, some jurisdictions have increased restrictions or banned the use of polyphosphoric acid in asphalt road construction while others have eased restrictions or are in the process of allowing its use. During 2008, such restrictions were implemented in New York State, while in 2009 restrictions were reversed in Wyoming and Colorado allowing the use of polyphosphoric acid in asphalt road construction on an exception basis; since then Colorado has reinstituted the restrictions, but approval for use is under review after the completion of multi-year trials. Georgia (2012), South Carolina (2014) and Nebraska (2015) have approved the use of polyphosphoric acid in asphalt road construction and other states are evaluating its allowance. If restrictions are instituted in multiple jurisdictions or throughout the United States and Canada, a significant impact on our business could occur.\nChanges in composition or permitted-use regulations in domestic or export countries may affect the regulatory status of our finished products and our ability to sell these products into some markets. Such changes may in turn require us to reformulate or establish alternative raw material sourcing, potentially incurring additional cost. If these measures are not successful, the available markets for our products may be limited.\nPage 15 of 84\nWe, our representatives, and the industries in which we operate are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulators and other governmental authorities, which may, in certain circumstances, lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages. Maintaining compliance with health and safety and environmental laws and regulations has resulted in ongoing costs for us. Currently, we are involved in several compliance and remediation efforts and agency inspections concerning health, safety and environmental matters. Although we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time.\nOur operations also expose us to the risk of claims for environmental remediation and restoration or for exposure to hazardous materials. Our production facilities require various operating permits that are subject to renewal or modification. Violations of environmental laws, regulations, or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on operating activities, substantial fines, penalties, damages, the rescission or denial of operating permits, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, or other costs.\nSome existing environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at those locations without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Many of our sites have an extended history of industrial use, which may expose us to liability. Soil and groundwater contamination have been detected at some of our sites, and additional contamination might occur or be discovered at these sites or other sites (including sites which we might acquire or to which we may have sent hazardous waste) in the future, which could expose us to liability. For example, future environmental spending is probable at our site in Nashville, Tennessee, as discussed further in Note 16 (Commitments and Contingencies) of the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we are continuing our ongoing negotiations with federal and Louisiana authorities with respect to alleged non-compliance at our Geismar, Louisiana facility, as discussed further in Note 16 (Commitments and Contingencies) of the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We continue to investigate, monitor or clean-up contamination at most of these sites. Due to the uncertainties associated with environmental investigations and clean-ups and the ongoing nature of the investigations and clean-ups at our sites, we cannot predict precisely the nature, cost, and timing of our future remedial obligations with respect to our sites.\nInternational Operations - We are subject to a variety of risks with respect to our foreign operations.\nWe have significant production operations in Mexico and Canada, and in 2012 we completed construction of our blending operation for food ingredients at a new facility in China which became operational in 2013. We continually evaluate business opportunities that may expand our operations to other areas beyond our current operations. We believe that revenue from sales outside the United States will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. There are inherent risks in international operations, the most notable being currency fluctuations and devaluations, economic and business conditions that differ from U.S. cycles, divergent social and political conditions that may become unsettled or even disruptive, communication and translation delays and errors due to cultural and language barriers and less predictable outcomes from differing legal and judicial systems. Until we gain familiarity with the risk environment on an ongoing basis, our risks in those regards are likely to be greatest as we continue to implement our new business startup in China. Among the additional risks potentially affecting our Mexican operations are changes in local economic conditions, currency devaluations, potential disruption from socio-political violence in that country, and difficulty in contract enforcement due to differences in the Mexican legal and regulatory regimes compared to those of the United States. Risks to our Canadian operations include a differing federal and provincial regulatory environment from that in the United States and currency fluctuations and devaluations. In the event that we establish operations in additional regions, our exposures to risks from the noted causes and from other as yet unknown causes may increase.\nIn addition, we are required to comply with the laws of each jurisdiction in which we have operations or sell our products, including safety and quality laws, marketing laws, antitrust laws and import and export control laws. The laws of these jurisdictions vary significantly, and we have limited experience in complying with the laws of certain such jurisdictions, including China. Violations of such laws may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities, substantial fines, civil or criminal penalties, damages, the rescission of operating permits, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, or other costs.\nOur overall success as a multinational business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social and political conditions. Among other things, we are faced with potential difficulties in building and starting up local facilities, staffing and managing local workforces, and designing and effecting solutions to manage commercial risks posed by local customers and distributors. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business. These risks are not limited to only those countries where we actually operate facilities, but may extend to areas and regions that supply and service our facilities or are supplied and serviced by them.\nAs a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which generally prohibit U.S. companies, their subsidiaries and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials\nPage 16 of 84\nfor the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. We are also subject to the comparable anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we operate. We sell many of our products in developing countries through sales agents and distributors whose personnel are not subject to our disciplinary procedures. Although we and our subsidiaries are committed to conducting business in a legal and ethical manner wherever we operate, and we communicate and seek to monitor compliance with our policies by all who do business with us, we cannot be sure that all our third party distributors or agents remain in full compliance with the FCPA or comparable foreign regulations at all times. Violations of the FCPA or similar anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and could adversely affect our reputation.\nProduct Liability Exposure - We may be subject to costly product liability claims with respect to our products.\nMany of our products are functional or fortification additives used in the food and beverage, consumer product, nutritional supplement and pharmaceutical industries. The sale of these additives and our customers' products that include them involve the risk of product liability and personal injury claims, which may be brought by our customers or end-users of our customers\u2019 products. Although we endeavor to adhere to stringent quality standards in the course of their production, storage and transportation, our products could be subject to adverse effects from foreign matter such as moisture, dust, odors, insects, mold or other substances, or from excessive temperature variations. Our products may also be susceptible to non-conformance resulting from our raw materials or other products supplied to us by third parties that we resell. In addition, we could be subject to claims by end-users of our customers\u2019 products that incorporate our products that our customers have mislabeled or misrepresented the benefits of their products sold to such end-users. Historically, we have not been subject to material product liability claims, and no material claims are outstanding. However, because our products are used in manufacturing a wide variety of our customers' products, including those ingested by humans, and we have concentrated the recent growth of our business in those areas, we cannot be sure we will not be subject to material product liability or recall claims in the future. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in: decreased demand for our products; regulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications; loss of revenues; substantial costs of litigation; liabilities that substantially exceed our product liability insurance, which we would then be required to pay ourselves; an increase in our product liability insurance rates; and damage to our reputation and the reputation of our products.\nProduction Facility Operating Hazards - We may be subject to liability with respect to the operations of our production facilities.\nOur production facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacturing, handling, storage, and transportation of chemical substances and products, including failure of pipeline integrity, explosions, fires, inclement weather and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, mechanical failures, unscheduled downtime, transportation or utility interruptions, remedial complications, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances, storage tank leaks and other environmental risks. Although we have implemented and installed various management systems and engineering controls and procedures at all our production facilities to enhance safety and minimize these risks and we insure our facilities to protect against a range of risks, these potential hazards continue to exist and could cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and environmental and natural resource damage, and may result in a suspension of operations (or extended shutdowns) and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, whose nature, timing, severity and non-insured exposures are unknown.\nIntellectual Property Rights - If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our position in the market may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secrecy, and other intellectual property laws to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights on a worldwide basis. Nonetheless, we cannot be sure that any pending patent application or trademark application will result in an issued patent or registered trademark, that any issued or registered patents or trademarks will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that our confidentiality procedures will maintain the confidentiality of our confidential information. The use of our intellectual property by others could reduce any competitive advantage we have developed or otherwise harm our business. Moreover, we cannot be sure that our intellectual property rights can be asserted in all cases, particularly in an international context, or that we can defend ourselves successfully or cost-effectively against the assertion of rights by others.\nContingency Planning - We may face operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate a number of manufacturing facilities in the United States, Mexico, Canada and China, and we coordinate company activities, including our sales, customer service, information technology systems and administrative services and the like, through headquarters operated in those countries.\nOur sites and those of others who provide services to them are subject to varying risks of disaster and follow on consequences, both manmade and natural, that could degrade or render inoperable one or more of our facilities for an extended period of time.\nPage 17 of 84\nSuch disaster related risks and effects are not predictable with certainty and, although they can be mitigated, they cannot be completely prevented. Although we have reviewed and analyzed a broad range of risks applicable to our business, the ones that actually affect us may not be those we have concluded most likely to occur. Furthermore, although our reviews have led to more systematic contingency planning, our plans are in varying stages of development and execution, such that they may not be adequate at the time of occurrence for the magnitude of any particular disaster event that befalls us.\nWe depend on our information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business, including accounting, data storage, compliance, purchasing and inventory management. Although we attempt to mitigate interruptions, we may experience difficulties in implementing certain upgrades, which would impact our business operations, or experience difficulties in operating our business during the upgrade, either of which could disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track product orders, project inventory requirements, manage our supply chain and otherwise adequately service our customers. In the event that we experience significant disruptions as a result of the implementation of our information technology systems, we may not be able to repair our systems in an efficient and timely manner. Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our entire operation.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks pose a risk to the security of Innophos\u2019 and our customers', partners', suppliers' and third-party service providers' respective products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our and our customers' data. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. We may have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action.\nAcquisition Risks - Any acquisitions or divestitures we make could disrupt our business and not produce the expected benefits of such transaction.\nWe will continue from time to time to consider certain acquisitions or divestitures. Acquisitions and divestitures involve numerous risks, including identifying attractive target acquisitions, undisclosed risks affecting the target, difficulties integrating acquired businesses, the assumption of unknown liabilities, potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with current customers and suppliers, the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and decreased geographic diversification.\nWe cannot provide assurance that any acquisitions or divestitures will perform as planned or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow, or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions that we undertake. Any such failure could seriously harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain Financial Risks\nContingencies Affecting Dividends - Our ability to pay dividends in the future may be compromised.\nAfter our common stock became publicly traded in 2006, our Board of Directors initiated a policy of paying regular quarterly cash dividends, subject to the availability of funds, legal and contractual restrictions and prudent needs of our business. We have maintained that policy and paid dividends continuously since that time, making payments that we believed were prudent and promoted stockholder value. However, we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are normally dependent upon cash dividends, distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries, most directly Innophos, Inc., our primary operating subsidiary, and its intermediate parent, to make dividend payments on our common stock. The amounts available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted by provisions of Delaware law and historically, and we expect for the future, also by limitations in our debt facilities. As allowed by existing debt instruments, we may incur additional indebtedness that may restrict to an even greater degree, or prohibit, the payment of dividends on stock. We cannot be sure the level of our operations or agreements governing our current or future indebtedness will permit us to adhere to our current dividend policy, increase dividends, or pay any dividends at all, or that continued payment of dividends will remain prudent for our business in the future judgment of our Board of Directors.\nCredit Facility Risks - Our credit facility restricts our current and future operations.\nPage 18 of 84\nIn 2010, we entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders to establish a credit facility, which agreement was amended and restated in 2012. This credit facility imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including affirmative and negative covenants that prohibit or limit a variety of actions by Innophos generally without the lenders\u2019 approval. These include covenants that affect our ability, among other things, to: incur or guarantee indebtedness; create liens; enter into mergers, recapitalizations or assets purchases or sales; change names; make certain changes to our business; make restricted payments that include dividends, purchases and redemptions of equity; make advances, investments or loans; effect sales and leasebacks; enter into transactions with affiliates; allow negative pledges or limitations on the repayment abilities of subsidiaries; or amend subordinated debt. In addition to these restrictions and covenants, our credit facility requires us to comply with specified financial maintenance covenants. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants. In addition, any of these restrictions or covenants could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet certain capital needs and could otherwise restrict our corporate activities. For example, our results of operations may limit our borrowing base to a level below that which we seek to establish. Any such limitation could harm our business.", "PERMNO": 91614, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "IPHS"}
