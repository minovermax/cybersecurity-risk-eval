RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves various risks which are particular to SmartFinancial, its industry, and its market area. Several risk factors regarding investing in our securities are discussed below. This listing should not be considered as all-inclusive. If any of the following risks were to occur, we may not be able to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition or operating results could be negatively impacted. These matters could cause the trading price of our securities to decline in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur net interest income could be negatively affected by interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board.\nAs a financial institution, our earnings are dependent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets, such as investment securities and loans, and the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, including changes resulting from changes in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policies, affects us more than non-financial institutions and can have a significant effect on our net interest income and total income. Our assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristics of our assets and liabilities. As a result, an increase or decrease in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net interest margin and results of operations. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board, could have an adverse effect on our deposit levels, loan demand, business and results of operations.\nChanges in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate loans, the value of our assets, and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings. A decline in the market value of our assets may limit our ability to borrow additional funds. As a result, we could be required to sell some of our loans and investments under adverse market conditions, upon terms that are not favorable to us, in order to maintain our liquidity. If those sales are made at prices lower than the amortized costs of the investments, we will incur losses.\nInterest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increases the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of any underlying property that serves as collateral for such loans may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. In addition, an increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on net interest income. If interest rates were to decrease, our yield on our variable rate loans and on our new loans would decrease, reducing our net interest income. In addition, lower interest rates may reduce our realized yields on investment securities which would reduce our net interest income and cause downward pressure on net interest margin in future periods. A significant reduction in our net interest income could have a material adverse impact on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe primary tool that management uses to measure short-term interest rate risk is a net interest income simulation model prepared by an independent third party provider. As of December 31, 2020, SmartFinancial is considered to be in an asset-sensitive position, meaning income is generally expected to increase with an increase in short-term interest rates and, conversely, to decrease with a decrease in short-term interest rates. Based on the results of this simulation model, which assumed a static environment with no contemplated asset growth or changes in our balance sheet management strategies, if short-term interest rates immediately increased by 200 basis points, we could expect net interest income to increase by approximately $11.9 million over a 12-month period. If short-term interest rates immediately decreased by 200 basis points, we could expect net interest income to decrease by approximately $2.4 million over the next 12-month period.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify these systems as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSeveral U.S. financial institutions have recently experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks, some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems. Other attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. To date, none of these types of attacks have had a material effect on our business or operations. However, no assurances can be provided that we may not suffer from such an attack in the future that may cause us material harm. Such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. We are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, remediation costs, regulatory action and reputational harm to us.\nIn addition, we provide our customers the ability to bank remotely, including over the Internet or through their mobile device. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote and mobile banking. Although we regularly add additional security measures to our computer systems and network infrastructure to mitigate the possibility of cyber security breaches, including firewalls and penetration testing, it is difficult or impossible to defend against every risk being posed by changing technologies as well as criminal intent on committing cyber-crime. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches (including breaches of security of customer systems and networks) and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation that could limit or restrict our activities, which in turn may adversely impact our ability to increase our assets and earnings.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to supervision and regulation by a number of governmental regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the TDFI and to a lesser extent, the FDIC and the CFPB. Regulations adopted by these agencies, which are generally intended to provide protection for depositors and customers rather than for the benefit of shareholders, govern a comprehensive range of matters relating to ownership and control of our shares, our acquisition of other companies and businesses, permissible activities for us to engage in, maintenance of adequate capital levels, and other aspects of our operations. These bank regulators possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business, profitability or growth strategy. Increased regulation could increase our cost of compliance and adversely affect profitability. Moreover, certain of these regulations contain significant punitive sanctions for violations, including monetary penalties and limitations on a bank\u2019s ability to implement components of its business plan, such as expansion through mergers and acquisitions or the opening of new branch offices. In addition, changes in regulatory requirements may add costs associated with compliance efforts. Furthermore, government policy and regulation, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, significantly affect credit conditions. Negative developments in the financial industry and the impact of new legislation and regulation in response to those developments could negatively impact our business operations and adversely impact our financial performance.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Federal Reserve requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. As a result, we may not be able to serve existing indebtedness, and such default may require us to declare bankruptcy. Any capital contributions by a bank holding company to its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be incurred by us to make a required capital injection to the Bank becomes more difficult and expensive and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state regulators periodically examine our business, and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe Federal Reserve and the TDFI periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, interest rate sensitivity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil money penalties, to fine or remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nThe novel coronavirus, COVID-19, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and our liquidity in the short term and for the foreseeable future.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures implemented to prevent its spread could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and such effects will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\nGlobal health concerns relating to the COVID-19 outbreak and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, and the outbreak has significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity. The outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. Such measures have significantly contributed to rising unemployment and negatively impacted consumer and business spending. The United States government has taken steps to attempt to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects of the virus, including the passage of the CARES Act, but there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion.\nThe outbreak has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact our workforce and operations and the operations of our borrowers, customers and business partners. In particular, we may experience financial losses due to a number of operational factors impacting us or our borrowers, customers or business partners, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf credit losses resulting from financial stress being experienced by our borrowers as a result of the outbreak and related governmental actions, particularly in the hospitality, energy, retail and restaurant industries;\n\u25cf declines in collateral values;\n\u25cf third party disruptions, including outages at network providers and other suppliers;\n\u25cf increased cyber and payment fraud risk, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption, given increased online and remote activity;\n\u25cf risk of litigation or other third-party claims, including with respect to our participation in the Payroll Protection Program and any other government-sponsored stimulus programs; and\n\u25cf operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by the outbreak and related governmental actions.\nThese factors may remain prevalent for a significant period of time and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, and developing work from home and social distancing plans for our employees), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.\nThe extent to which the coronavirus outbreak impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus\u2019s global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThere are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nIf our allowance for loan losses and fair value adjustments with respect to acquired loans is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nOur success depends significantly on the quality of our assets, particularly loans. Like other financial institutions, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate us for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral. As a result, we may experience significant loan losses that may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses with respect to our loan portfolio, in an attempt to cover loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. In determining the size of the allowance, we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio, our experience and our evaluation of general economic conditions. We also make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the diversification in our loan portfolio, the effect of changes in the economy on real estate and other collateral values, the results of recent regulatory examinations, the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic conditions and their probable impact on borrowers, the amount of charge-offs for the period and the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security.\nThe application of the acquisition method of accounting in our acquisitions has impacted our allowance for loan losses. Under the acquisition method of accounting, all acquired loans were recorded in our consolidated financial statements at their fair values at the time of acquisition and the related allowance for loan losses was eliminated because credit quality, among other factors, was considered in the determination of fair value. To the extent that our estimates of fair values are too high, we will incur losses associated with the acquired loans. The allowance, if any, associated with our purchased credit impaired loans reflects deterioration in cash flows since acquisition resulting from our quarterly re-estimation of cash flows which involves complex cash flow projections and significant judgment on timing of loan resolution.\nIf our analysis or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our current allowance may not be sufficient, and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Material additions to the allowance for loan losses would materially decrease our net income and adversely affect our general financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.77% and as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was 315.16%. Although management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses on any existing loans that may become uncollectible, we may be required to take additional provisions for loan losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for loan losses, either due to management\u2019s decision to do so or because our banking regulators require us to do so. Federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur success depends significantly on economic conditions in our market areas.\nUnlike larger organizations that are more geographically diversified, our branches are currently concentrated in East and Middle Tennessee, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results will depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions, locally or nationally, deteriorate, this may have a significant impact on the amount of loans that we originate, the ability of our borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A return to economic downturn conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, government action, health emergencies, disease pandemics, natural disasters or other factors beyond our control would likely contribute to the deterioration of the quality of our loan portfolio and reduce our level of deposits, which in turn would have an adverse\neffect on our business. In addition, some portions of our target market are in areas which a substantial portion of the economy is dependent upon tourism. The tourism industry tends to be more sensitive than the economy as a whole to changes in unemployment, inflation, wage growth, and other factors which affect consumer\u2019s financial condition and sentiment.\nCompetition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe experience competition in our market from many other financial institutions. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, internet banks, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other community banks and super-regional and national financial institutions that operate offices in our service area. These competitors often have far greater resources than we do and are able to conduct more extensive and broader marketing efforts to reach both commercial and individual clients. Our competitors may be able to offer more attractive interest rates and other financial terms than we offer or have the ability to offer. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. We compete with these other financial institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we must attract our client base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete with an array of financial institutions in our service area. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, including, among other things, our ability to recruit and retain experienced and talented bankers at competitive compensation levels, build and maintain long-term client relationships while ensuring high ethical standards and safe and sound banking practices, compete with the scope, relevance and pricing of the products and services we provide, maintain a competitive level of client satisfaction with our products and services, keep pace with technological advances and invest in new technology, and depend on general economic trend and trends within our industry.\nIncreased competition could require us to increase the rates that we pay on deposits or lower the rates that we offer on loans, which could reduce our profitability. Our failure to compete effectively in our market could restrain our growth or cause us to lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and results of operations.\nOur organic loan growth may be limited by regulatory constraints.\nDuring 2019 many of the regulatory agencies, including ours, increased their focus on the application of an interagency guidance issued in 2006, titled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices.\u201d The 2006 interagency guidance focuses on the risks of high levels of concentration in CRE lending at banking institutions, and specifically addresses two supervisory criteria:\n\u25cf Construction concentration criterion: Loans for construction, land, and land development (CLD or \u201cconstruction\u201d) represent 100% or more of a banking institution\u2019s total risk-based capital, commonly referred to as the \"100 ratio\"\n\u25cf Total CRE concentration criterion: Total nonowner-occupied CRE loans (including CLD loans), as defined in the 2006 guidance (\u201ctotal CRE\u201d), represent 300% or more of the institution\u2019s total risk-based capital, and growth in total CRE lending has increased by 50% or more during the previous 36 months, commonly referred to as the \"300 ratio\"\nThe guidance states that banking institutions exceeding the concentration levels mentioned in the two supervisory criteria should have in place enhanced credit risk controls, including stress testing of CRE portfolios. At the end of 2020 our loan portfolio was below both the 100 and 300 ratios as laid out in the guidance, but given the guidance our ability to grow those loan types could be constrained by the amount we are also able to grow capital.\nChanges in accounting standards, including the implementation of Current Expected Credit Loss methodology, could materially affect how we report our financial results.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board adopted a new accounting standard for determining the amount of our allowance for credit losses (ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)) that will be effective for us January 1, 2023. We believe that adoption of ASU 2016-13 will result in an increase to our allowance for loan and lease losses, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d). Implementation of CECL will require that we determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected future credit losses on loans in the allowance for loan and lease losses in the period when the loans are booked. The ongoing impact of CECL will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Should these factors materially change, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance for loan and lease losses, decreasing or increasing our net income, and introducing additional volatility into our net income.\nTo the extent that we are unable to identify and consummate attractive acquisitions, or increase loans through organic loan growth, we may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nA substantial part of our historical growth has been a result of acquisitions and we intend to continue to grow our business through strategic acquisitions of banking franchises coupled with organic loan growth. Previous availability of attractive acquisition targets may not be indicative of future acquisition opportunities, and we may be unable to identify any acquisition targets that meet our investment objectives. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition candidates, an important component of our strategy may be lost. We also face significant competition from numerous other financial services institutions, many of which will have greater financial resources than we do, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any future acquisitions. If we are able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we must generally satisfy a number of conditions prior to completing any such transaction, including certain bank regulatory approvals, which have become substantially more difficult, time-consuming and unpredictable as a result of the recent financial crisis. Additionally, any future acquisitions may not produce the revenue, earnings or synergies that we anticipated. As our purchased credit impaired loan portfolio, which produces substantially higher yields than our organic and purchased non-credit impaired loan portfolios, is paid down, we expect downward pressure on our income. If we are unable to replace our purchased credit impaired loans and the related accretion with a significantly higher level of new performing loans and other earning assets due to our inability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, a decline in loan demand, competition from other financial institutions in our markets, stagnation or continued deterioration of economic conditions, or other conditions, our financial condition and earnings may be adversely affected.\nOur recent acquisition and future expansion may result in additional risks.\nWe expect to continue to expand in our current markets and in other select markets through additional branches or through acquisitions of all or part of other financial institutions. These types of expansions involve various risks, including the risks detailed below.\nThe merger with PFG was completed on March 1, 2020, and while this integration effort is substantially complete, we continue to manage the acquired business through the transition. The success of this transition will depend on, among other things, our ability to realize anticipated costs savings and to manage the acquired assets and operations in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt our existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers. We may encounter a number of difficulties, including, among others:\n\u25cf the loss of key employees;\n\u25cf disruption of operations and business;\n\u25cf inability to maintain and increase competitive presence;\n\u25cf loan and deposit attrition, customer loss and revenue loss, including as a result of any decision we may make to close one or more locations;\n\u25cf possible inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies;\n\u25cf unexpected problems with costs, operations, personnel, technology and credit; and/or\n\u25cf problems with the assimilation of new operations, sites or personnel, which could divert resources from regular banking operations.\nFailure to achieve these anticipated benefits on the anticipated timeframe, or at all, could result in a reduction in the price of our shares as well as in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, will make fair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities in recording our acquisition of PFG. Actual values of these assets and liabilities could differ from our estimates, which could result in our not achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings.\nFurther, we acquire banks with the expectation that these mergers will result in various benefits including, among other things, benefits relating to enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position for the combined company, cross selling opportunities, technology, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of these mergers is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we integrate these institutions in an efficient and effective manner, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in a reduction in the price of our shares as well as in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may face risks with respect to future acquisitions.\nWhen we attempt to expand our business through mergers and acquisitions, we seek targets that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and possess either market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services. In addition to the general risks associated with our growth plans which are highlighted above, in general, acquiring other banks, businesses or branches, particularly those in markets with which we are less familiar, involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us in our current markets, as well as other markets, throughout the region and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash or equity securities and related capital raising transactions may occur at any time. Generally, acquisitions of financial institutions involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our book value and fully diluted earnings per share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in product presence and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur concentration in loans secured by real estate, particularly commercial real estate and construction and development, is subject to risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe offer a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Many of our loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) in our market areas. Consequently, declines in economic conditions in these market areas may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 73% of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral, which includes 12% of our loans secured by construction and development collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected. Real estate values declined significantly during the recent economic crisis and may decline similarly in future periods. Although real estate prices in\nmost of our markets have stabilized or are improving, a renewed decline in real estate values would expose us to further deterioration in the value of the collateral for all loans secured by real estate and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCommercial real estate loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans, particularly when there is a downturn in the business cycle. They are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and depend on cash flows from the owner\u2019s business or the property to service the debt. Cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions and a downturn in the local economy or in occupancy rates in the local economy where the property is located, each of which could increase the likelihood of default on the loan. Because our loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in the percentage of nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, which could negatively affect our stock price.\nIf a commercial real estate loan did default there would be legal expenses associated with obtaining the real estate which is typically collateral for the loan. In the last several years the amount of these legal expenses has been low, compared to periods when the defaults of commercial real estate loans have been higher. Once we obtain the collateral for the commercial real estate loan it is put into other real estate owned. Other real estate owned assets generally do not produce income but do have the costs associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs. Since these assets have a cost to maintain our goal is to keep costs at a minimum by liquidating the assets as soon as possible. Among other reasons the rate of loan defaults increase as the economy worsens and declining economic environment and political turmoil generally results in downward pressure on foreclosed asset values and increased marketing periods.\nOur largest loan relationships currently make up a significant percentage of our total loan portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our 10 largest borrowing relationships totaled approximately $192 million in outstanding balances, or approximately 8% of our total loan portfolio. The concentration risk associated with having a small number of relatively large loan relationships is that, if one or more of these relationships were to become delinquent or suffer default, we could be at risk of material losses. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover losses associated with any of these relationships, and any loss or increase in the allowance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDeclines in the businesses or industries of our customers could cause increased credit losses and decreased loan balances, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe small to medium-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A substantial focus of our marketing and business strategy is to serve small to medium-sized businesses in our market areas. As a result, a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio consists of commercial loans to such businesses. We further anticipate an increase in the amount of loans to small to medium-sized businesses during 2021.\nSmall to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small and medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have an adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact the markets in which we operate and small to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise harmed by adverse business developments, this, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReal estate market volatility and future changes in our disposition strategies could result in net proceeds that differ significantly from our other real estate owned fair value appraisals.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held an other real estate owned balance of $4.6 million. Our other real estate owned portfolio historically has been insignificant, and generally consisted of properties that we obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Properties in our other real estate owned portfolio are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loans for which the properties previously served as collateral or the \u201cfair value,\u201d which represents the estimated sales price of the properties on the date acquired less estimated selling costs. Generally, in determining \u201cfair value,\u201d an orderly disposition of the property is assumed, except when a different disposition strategy is expected. Judgment is required in estimating the fair value of other real estate owned, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is shortened during periods of market volatility. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from such sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales and other estimates used to determine the fair value of our other real estate owned properties.\nOur use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan secured by real property does not ensure the value of the real property collateral.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is conducted, and an error in fact or judgment could adversely affect the reliability of an appraisal. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to decrease. As a result of any of these factors the value of collateral securing a loan may be less than estimated, and if a default occurs we may not recover the outstanding balance of the loan.\nInterest rates on our outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on regulatory developments, which could adversely affect our revenue, expenses, and the value of those financial instruments.\nLIBOR and certain other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear whether, at that time, LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, interest rates on our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected. Any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates.\nOur adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans are generally based on the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate (WSJPR) or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). However, we may not be able to successfully eliminate all loans tied to LIBOR prior to 2022. Even with \u201cfallback\u201d provisions contained within remaining LIBOR tied loans, changes to or the discontinuance of LIBOR could result in customer uncertainty and disputes around how variable rates should be calculated. All of this could result in damage to our reputation, loss of customers and additional costs to us, all of which could be material.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund our operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity represents an institution\u2019s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors, borrowers and other creditors by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds. Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may be unable to satisfy current or future funding requirements and needs.\nThe objective of managing liquidity risk is to ensure that our cash flow requirements resulting from depositor, borrower and other creditor demands as well as our operating cash needs, are met, and that our cost of funding such requirements and needs is reasonable. We maintain an asset/liability and interest rate risk policy and a liquidity and funds management\npolicy, including a contingency funding plan that, among other things, include procedures for managing and monitoring liquidity risk. Generally we rely on deposits, repayments of loans and cash flows from our investment securities as our primary sources of funds. Our principal deposit sources include consumer, commercial and public funds customers in our markets. We have used these funds, together with wholesale deposit sources such as brokered deposits, along with Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (\u201cFHLB Cincinnati\u201d) advances, federal funds purchased and other sources of short-term and long-term borrowings, to make loans, acquire investment securities and other assets and to fund continuing operations.\nAn inability to maintain or raise funds in amounts necessary to meet our liquidity needs could have a substantial negative effect, individually or collectively, on SmartFinancial and SmartBank\u2019s liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms attractive to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. For example, factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us, a reduction in our credit rating, any damage to our reputation or any other decrease in depositor or investor confidence in our creditworthiness and business. Our access to liquidity could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as severe volatility or disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Any such event or failure to manage our liquidity effectively could affect our competitive position, increase our borrowing costs and the interest rates we pay on deposits, limit our access to the capital markets, cause our regulators to criticize our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nDeposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including demands by customers, rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments, general economic and market conditions and other factors. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds but are subject to the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans, which can be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in general economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups or specific businesses, declines in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters, prolonged government shutdowns and other factors. Furthermore, loans generally are not readily convertible to cash. Accordingly, we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet growth in loans, deposit withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such secondary sources include FHLB Cincinnati advances, brokered deposits, secured and unsecured federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks, Federal Reserve borrowings and/or accessing the equity or debt capital markets.\nWe anticipate we will continue to rely primarily on deposits, loan repayments, and cash flows from our investment securities to provide liquidity. Additionally, where necessary, the secondary sources of borrowed funds described above will be used to augment our primary funding sources. If we are unable to access any of these secondary funding sources when needed, we might be unable to meet our customers\u2019 or creditors\u2019 needs, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe could recognize losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nFactors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities acquired by us are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities or our own analysis of the value of the security, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, or instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face additional risks due to our increase in mortgage banking activities that have and could negatively impact our net income and profitability.\nWe have established mortgage banking operations which expose us to risks that are different from our retail and commercial banking operations. During higher and rising interest rate environments, the demand for mortgage loans and the level of refinancing activity tends to decline, which can lead to reduced volumes of business and lower revenues, which could negatively impact our earnings. While we have been experiencing historically low interest rates, the low interest rate environment likely will not continue indefinitely. Because we sell a portion of the mortgage loans we originate, the profitability of our mortgage banking operations also depends in large part on our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and sell them in the secondary market at a gain. Thus, in addition to our dependence on the interest rate environment, we are dependent upon (a) the existence of an active secondary market and (b) our ability to profitably sell loans into that market. Profitability of our mortgage operations will depend upon our ability to increase production and thus income while holding or reducing costs. In addition, mortgages sold to third-party investors are typically subject to certain repurchase provisions related to borrower refinancing, defaults, fraud or other reasons stipulated in the applicable third-party investor agreements. If the fair value of a loan when repurchased is less than the fair value when sold, we may be required to charge such shortfall to earnings.\nAny expansion into new lines of business might not be successful.\nAs part of our ongoing strategic plan, we will continue to consider expansion into new lines of business through the acquisition of third parties, or through organic growth and development. There are substantial risks associated with such efforts, including risks that (a) revenues from such activities might not be sufficient to offset the development, compliance, and other implementation costs, (b) competing products and services and shifting market preferences might affect the profitability of such activities, (c) regulatory compliance obligations prevent the success of a new line of business, and (d) our internal controls might be inadequate to manage the risks associated with new activities. Furthermore, it is possible that our unfamiliarity with new lines of business might adversely affect the success of such actions. If any such expansions into new product markets are not successful, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny deficiencies in our financial reporting or internal controls could materially and adversely affect us, including resulting in material misstatements in our financial statements, and could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, our operating results could be harmed and it could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in the future. Inferior controls and procedures or the identification of accounting errors could cause our investors to lose confidence in our internal controls and question our reported financial information, which, among other things, could have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, we could become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and a higher risk of shareholder litigation, which could result in significant additional expenses and require additional financial and management resources.\nInability to retain senior management and key employees or to attract new experienced financial services professionals could impair our relationship with our customers, reduce growth and adversely affect our business.\nWe have assembled a senior management team which has substantial background and experience in banking and financial services. Moreover, much of historical loan growth was the result of our ability to attract experienced financial services professionals who have been able to attract customers from other financial institutions. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. Competition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the financial services and banking industry is intense, which means the cost of hiring, incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase. We need to continue to attract and retain key personnel and to recruit qualified individuals to succeed existing key personnel to ensure the continued growth and successful operation of our business. Our ability to effectively compete for senior executives and other qualified personnel by offering competitive compensation and benefit arrangements may be restricted by applicable banking laws and regulations as discussed in \u201cPart 1 - Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Regulation of the Company - Incentive Compensation.\u201d Inability to retain these key personnel or to continue\nto attract experienced lenders with established books of business could negatively impact our growth because of the loss of these individuals\u2019 skills and customer relationships and/or the potential difficulty of promptly replacing them. In addition, to attract and retain personnel with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business, we may offer a variety of benefits, which could reduce our earnings.\nEmployee misconduct could expose us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nWe are vulnerable to reputational harm because we operate in an industry in which integrity and the confidence of our customers are of critical importance. Our employees could engage in fraudulent, illegal, wrongful or suspicious activities, and/or activities resulting in consumer harm that adversely affects our customers and/or our business. The precautions we take to detect and prevent such misconduct may not always be effective and regulatory sanctions and/or penalties, serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships and ability to attract new customers. In addition, improper use or disclosure of confidential information by our employees, even if inadvertent, could result in serious harm to our reputation, financial condition and current and future business relationships. The precautions we take to detect and prevent such misconduct may not always be effective.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. These losses or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Additionally, if our competitors were extending credit on terms we found to pose excessive risks, or at interest rates which we believed did not warrant the credit exposure, we may not be able to maintain our business volume and could experience deteriorating financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends is limited.\nThere can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Future dividends, if any, will be declared and paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors. Our principal source of funds used to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be dividends that we receive from SmartBank. Although the Bank\u2019s asset quality, earnings performance, liquidity and capital requirements will be taken into account before we declare or pay any future dividends on our common stock, our board of directors will also consider our liquidity and capital requirements and our board of directors could determine to declare and pay dividends without relying on dividend payments from the Bank.\nFederal and state banking laws and regulations and state corporate laws restrict the amount of dividends we may declare and pay. For example, the Federal Reserve could decide at any time that paying any dividends on our common stock could be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. For a discussion of current regulatory limits on our ability to pay dividends, see \u201cPart I - Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Regulation of the Company - Payment of Dividends\u201d in this Report for further information.\nEven though our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange.\nThe trading volume in our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market or other stock exchanges. Although we have experienced increased liquidity in our stock, we cannot say with any certainty that a more active and liquid trading market for our common stock will continue to develop. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness\ndepends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the continued development of the trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe may issue additional shares of stock or equity derivative securities, including awards to current and future executive officers, directors and employees, which could result in the dilution of shareholders\u2019 investment.\nOur authorized capital includes 40,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2020, we had 15,107,214 shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock outstanding, and had reserved or otherwise set aside for issuance 99,617 shares underlying outstanding options and 1,876,894 shares that are available for future grants of stock options, restricted stock or other equity-based awards pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Subject to NASDAQ rules, our board of directors generally has the authority to issue all or part of any authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock for any corporate purpose. We anticipate that we will issue additional equity in connection with the acquisition of other strategic partners and that in the future we likely will seek additional equity capital as we develop our business and expand our operations, depending on the timing and magnitude of any particular future acquisition. These issuances would dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of the common stock. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, our then existing shareholders.\nIn addition, the issuance of shares under our equity compensation plans will result in dilution of our shareholders\u2019 ownership of our Common Stock. The exercise price of stock options could also adversely affect the terms on which we can obtain additional capital. Option holders are most likely to exercise their options when the exercise price is less than the market price for our Common Stock. They may profit from any increase in the stock price without assuming the risks of ownership of the underlying shares of Common Stock by exercising their options and selling the stock immediately.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial fluctuations, which may make it difficult for you to sell your shares at the volume, prices and time desired.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u25cf recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry generally;\n\u25cf perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors; and\n\u25cf fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nAlthough there are currently no shares of our preferred stock issued and outstanding, our articles of incorporation authorize us to issue up to 2 million shares of one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval (subject to Nasdaq shareholder approval rules), to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common\nstock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our shareholders (subject to Nasdaq shareholder approval rules) may impede a takeover of us and prevent a transaction perceived to be favorable to our shareholders.\nAnti-takeover laws and certain agreements and charter provisions may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of state and federal law and our articles of incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of the Company. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity, or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, including the Company\u2019s shares. Banking agencies review the acquisition to determine if it will result in a change of control. The banking agencies have 60 days to act on the notice, and take into account several factors, including the resources of the acquiror and the antitrust effects of the acquisition. There also are Tennessee statutory provisions and provisions in our charter that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. As a result, these statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation could result in the Company being less attractive to a potential acquiror.\nSecondly, the amount of common stock owned by, and other compensation arrangements with, certain of our officers and directors may make it more difficult to obtain shareholder approval of potential takeovers that they oppose. Agreements with our senior management also provide for significant payments under certain circumstances following a change in control. These compensation arrangements, together with the common stock and option ownership of our board of directors and management, could make it difficult or expensive to obtain majority support for shareholder proposals or potential acquisition proposals that the board of directors and officers oppose.", "PERMNO": 15906, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SMBK"}
