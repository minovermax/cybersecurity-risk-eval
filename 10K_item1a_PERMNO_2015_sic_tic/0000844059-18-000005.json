RISK FACTORS.\nOur future results may be affected by a number of factors over which we have little or no control. The following issues, uncertainties, and risks, among others, should be considered in evaluating our business and outlook. Also, note that additional risks not currently identified or known to us could also negatively impact our business or financial results.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nSince the Spin-off of Patriot, FRP has shared executives with Patriot so those executives do not devote their full time and attention to the Company.\nUnder the terms of the now amended Transition Services Agreement between FRP and Patriot, Patriot now provides the services of only two of its executive officers to FRP. John D. Milton, Jr., Chief Financial Officer serves as General Counsel for Patriot and John D. Klopfenstein, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, serves in the same capacity with FRP under the Transition Services Agreement. John D. Klopfenstein spends approximately 50% of his time working for FRP pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement\nand both companies share in 50% of the costs (including overhead); John D. Milton, Jr. spends about 25% of his time working for Patriot and 75% of his time for FRP and his costs (including overhead) are shared in these proportions. FRP could be adversely impacted by lack of the full-time focus of these executives during the term of the Transition Services Agreement. In addition, these executives may face conflicts of interest, or the appearance thereof, if there is a dispute under the agreements between Patriot and FRP or a future business transaction.\nOur business may be adversely affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions.\nThe Mining Royalty Lands Segment and the Land Development and Construction Segment could be adversely affected by reduced construction and mining activity during periods of inclement weather. These factors could cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. An occurrence of unusually harsh or long-lasting inclement weather such as hurricanes, tornadoes and heavy snowfalls could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nOur revenues depend in part on construction sector activity, which tends to be cyclical.\nOur Mining Royalty Lands Segment revenues are derived from royalties on construction aggregates mined on our properties. Thus, our results depend in part on residential, commercial and infrastructure construction activity and spending levels. The construction industry in our markets tends to be cyclical. Construction activity and spending levels vary across our markets and are influenced by interest rates, inflation, consumer spending habits, demographic shifts, environmental laws and regulations, employment levels and the availability of funds for public infrastructure projects. Economic downturns may lead to recessions in the construction industry, either in individual markets or nationally.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nLiability for environmental contamination on real property owned by the Company may include the following costs, without limitation: investigation and feasibility study costs, remediation costs, litigation costs, oversight costs, monitoring costs, institutional control costs, penalties from state and federal agencies and third-party claims. These costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the value of the contaminated property. Moreover, on-site operations may be suspended until certain environmental contamination is remediated and/or permits are received, and governmental agencies can impose permanent restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used depending on the extent and nature of the contamination. This may result in a breach of the terms of the lease entered into with our tenants. Governmental agencies also may create liens on contaminated sites for damages it incurred to address such contamination. In addition, the presence of hazardous substances at, on, under or from a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property or borrow funds using the property as collateral, thus harming our financial condition.\nThe presence of contaminated material at our RiverFront on the Anacostia development site will subject us to substantial environmental liability and costs as construction proceeds.\nWith respect to our RiverFront on the Anacostia site in Washington, D.C., preliminary environmental testing has indicated the presence of contaminated material that will have to be specially handled in excavation in conjunction with construction. While we have recovered and will continue to seek partial reimbursement for these costs from our prior tenant and/or neighboring property owners, we still expect to incur significant environmental costs in connection with construction.\nAs of September 30, 2016, the excavation and foundation work for Phase 1 were substantially complete and the total remediation expense was $1.833 million.\nDuring the quarter ending December 31, 2015, management successfully completed negotiations and entered into a $3.0 million settlement of environmental claims on all four phases against our former tenant at the Riverfront on the Anacostia property and continues to pursue settlement negotiations with other potentially\nresponsible parties.\nThe Company executed a letter of intent with MRP Realty in May 2016 to develop Phase II of the Riverfront on the Anacostia project and recorded an estimated environmental remediation expense of $2.0 million for the Company\u2019s estimated liability under the proposed agreement.\nThe Company has no obligation to remediate this contamination on Phases III and IV of the development until such time as it makes a commitment to commence construction on each phase. The Company's actual expense to address this issue may be materially higher or lower than the expense previously recorded depending upon the actual costs incurred.\nUninsured losses could significantly reduce our earnings.\nWe self-insure for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from workers\u2019 compensation, auto liability, general liability and employees\u2019 health insurance. We also are responsible for our legal expenses relating to such claims. We maintain insurance above the amounts for which we self-insure with licensed insurance carriers. Although we believe the aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. Additionally, there are certain losses, such as losses from hurricanes, terrorism, wars or earthquakes, where insurance is limited or not economically justifiable. If the Company experiences an uninsured loss of real property, we could lose both the invested capital and anticipated revenues associated with such property. We accrue currently for estimated incurred losses and expenses and periodically evaluate and adjust our claims accrued liability to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses greater than accrued amounts.\nWe may be unable to renew leases or re-lease properties as leases expire.\nWhen a lease expires, a tenant may elect not to renew it. If that occurs, we may not be able to lease the property on similar terms. The terms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required renovations and concessions to tenants) may be less favorable than the prior lease. If we are unable to lease all or substantially all of our properties, or if the rental rates upon such re-leasing are significantly lower than expected rates, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures may be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2017, leases of our properties representing approximately 22%, 10.2%, and 11.6% of the total square footage of buildings completed prior to December 31, 2017 are scheduled to expire in years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nWe may be unable to lease currently vacant properties.\nAs of December 31, 2017, 6.9% of our properties are vacant. If we are unable to obtain leases sufficient to cover carrying costs then our cash flows may be adversely affected.\nThe bankruptcy or insolvency of significant tenants with long-term leases may adversely affect income produced by our properties.\nWe have 19 buildings in our portfolio that are single-tenant leased, representing 49% of developed property rentals under long-term leases. We have 9 other tenants with leases in excess of five years. Should tenants default on their obligations, our cash flow would be adversely affected and we may not be able to find another tenant to occupy the space under similar terms or may have to make expenditures to retrofit or divide the space. Additionally, we may have to incur a non-cash expense for a significant amount of deferred rent revenue generated from the accounting requirement to straight-line rental revenues. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely affect the income produced by a property. If any of our tenants become a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict that tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court may authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with the Company. Our claim against such a tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed to us under the tenant\u2019s lease. Any shortfall in rent payments could\nadversely affect our cash flow.\nA decline in the economic conditions in Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia markets could adversely affect our business.\nNearly all of our office, warehouse and apartment properties are located in the Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, we depend upon the local conditions in these markets, including local real estate conditions. We are, therefore, subject to increased exposure (positive or negative) to economic and other competitive factors specific to markets in confined geographic areas. Our operations may also be affected if too many competing properties are built in these markets. An economic downturn in these markets could adversely affect our operation. We cannot be sure that these markets will continue to grow or will continue to provide favorable demand for our office and warehouse spaces.\nOur inability to obtain necessary approvals for property development could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may be unable to obtain, or incur delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or abandonment of certain projects. Before we can develop a property, we must obtain a variety of approvals from local and state governments with respect to such matters as zoning, density, parking, subdivision, site planning and environmental issues. Legislation could impose moratoriums on new real estate development or land-use conversions from mining to development. These factors may reduce our profit or growth and may limit the value of these properties.\nReal estate investments are not as liquid as other types of assets.\nThe illiquid nature of real estate investments may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, significant expenditures associated with real estate investments, such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments. Thus, the illiquid nature of our real estate investments could adversely affect our profitability under certain economic conditions.\nOur debt service obligations may have adverse consequences on our business operations.\nWe use debt to finance our operations, including acquisitions of properties. Our use of debt may have adverse consequences, including the following:\n\u00b7 Our cash flows from operations may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.\n\u00b7 We may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms, to make payments on our debt.\n\u00b7 We may default on our debt obligations, and the lenders may foreclose on our properties that collateralize those loans.\n\u00b7 A foreclosure on one of our properties could create taxable income without any accompanying cash proceeds to pay the tax.\n\u00b7 A default under a mortgage loan that has cross default provisions may cause us to automatically default on another loan.\n\u00b7 We may not be able to refinance or extend our existing debt.\n\u00b7 The terms of any refinancing or extension may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt.\n\u00b7 We may not be able to issue debt on unencumbered properties under reasonable terms to finance growth of our portfolio of properties.\n\u00b7 We may be subject to a significant increase in the variable interest rates on our unsecured and secured lines of credit, which could adversely impact our operations.\n\u00b7 Our debt agreements have yield maintenance requirements that result in a penalty if we prepay loans.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding non-recourse mortgage indebtedness of $118,317,000, secured by developed real estate properties having a carrying value of $186,881,000.\nOur uncollateralized revolving credit agreement restricts our ability to engage in some business activities.\nOur uncollateralized revolving credit agreement contains customary negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that, among other things:\n\u00b7 restricts our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7 restricts our ability to make certain investments;\n\u00b7 restricts our ability to merge with another company;\n\u00b7 restricts our ability to pay dividends;\n\u00b7 requires us to maintain financial coverage ratios; and\n\u00b7 requires us to not encumber certain assets except as approved by the lenders.\nThese restrictions could cause us to default on our unsecured line of credit or negatively affect our operations.\nOur Asset Management and Land Development and Construction Segments face competition from numerous sources.\nAs a developer of flexible warehouse and office space, we compete with numerous developers, owners and operators of real estate, many of whom own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates to an amount lower than we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants\u2019 leases expire. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected.\nConstruction costs may be higher than anticipated.\nOur long-term business plan includes a number of construction projects. The construction costs of these projects may exceed original estimates and possibly make the completion of a property uneconomical. Building material commodity shortages, construction delays or stoppages or rapidly escalating construction costs may out-pace market rents, which would adversely affect our profits. The market environment and existing lease commitments may not allow us to raise rents to cover these higher costs.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nCertain shareholders have effective control of a significant percentage of FRP's common stock and likely will control the outcome of any shareholder vote.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our Chief Executive Officer, John D. Baker, II beneficially owned approximately 13.7% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (80.9% of such shares are held in trust under which voting power is shared with other family members) and certain of his family members beneficially own an additional 18.6% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, these individuals effectively may have the ability to direct the election of all members of our board of directors and to exercise a controlling influence over its business and affairs, including any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations involving the Company, its acquisition or disposition of assets, its borrowing of monies, its issuance of any additional securities, its repurchase of common stock and its payment of dividends.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of Florida law could\ndelay or prevent a change in control of FRP.\nThe existence of some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and Florida law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of FRP that a shareholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:\nproviding that directors may be removed by our shareholders only for cause;\nauthorizing a large number of shares of stock that are not yet issued, which would allow FRP\u2019s board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of FRP;\nprohibiting shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders or taking action by written consent; and\nimposing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors at the annual shareholder meetings.\nThese provisions apply even if a takeover offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the Company\u2019s or the shareholders\u2019 best interests.\nFRP may issue preferred stock with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other rights, and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of FRP's common stock. For example, FRP could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of its directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or dividend, distribution or liquidation preferences FRP could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.", "PERMNO": 10443, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "FRPH"}
