{"cik": "215466", "company": "Coeur Mining, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe Company's results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of silver and gold and other commodities, which are volatile and beyond the Company's control.\nSilver and gold are actively traded commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the price of silver ranged from a low of $13.71 per ounce to a high of $18.23 per ounce, and the price of gold ranged from a low of $1,049 per ounce to a high of $1,296 per ounce. The closing market prices of silver and gold on February 9, 2016 were $15.34 per ounce and $1,191 per ounce, respectively.\nSilver and gold prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including U.S. dollar strength or weakness, prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, global currency values, governmental decisions regarding precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (\u201cETFs\u201d), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals, have become significant holders of gold and silver. Factors that are generally understood to contribute to a decline in the prices of silver and gold include a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, net outflows from gold and silver ETFs, bullion sales by private and government holders and global economic conditions and/or fiscal policies that negatively impact large consumer markets.\nBecause the Company derives all of its revenues from sales of silver and gold, its results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change. A period of significant and sustained lower gold and silver prices would materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if market prices for silver and gold decline further or remain at current or lower levels for a sustained period of time, the Company may have to revise its operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of its properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. The Company may be unable to decrease its costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, and may continue to incur losses.\nOperating costs at the Company\u2019s mines are also affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies the Company purchases could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.\nThe significant and sustained decline in gold and silver prices since 2013 caused the Company to write down certain of its long-lived assets and, in the future, such declines could cause one or more of the Company\u2019s mining properties to become less profitable, which could require the Company to record additional write-downs of long-lived assets. Such write-downs may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board\u2019s Accounting Standards Codification Section 360 (\u201cASC 360\u201d). Under that standard, the Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets, such as its mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves the Company estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset\u2019s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. The Company conducts a review of the financial performance of its mines in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for each reported period and determines whether any triggering events are indicated.\nThe Company\u2019s assessment of the recoverability of its long-lived assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 under ASC 360 indicated that write-downs of its long-lived assets of $313.3 million and $1,472.7 million, respectively, were required. These non-cash impairment charges resulted in write-downs in the Company's Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and reduced the carrying value of Mining properties and Property, plant, and equipment on the Company\u2019s balance sheet at December 31, 2015 and 2014. See Note 4 -- Write-Downs in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nIf there are further significant and sustained declines in silver and gold prices or if the currently low silver or gold prices remain at such prices, or if the Company fails to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its mining properties, the Company may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of the Company\u2019s assets. Any such actions would adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may record other types of charges in the future if it sells a property for a price less than its carrying value or has to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any additional write-downs of mining properties could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s future growth will depend upon its ability to develop new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition from other mining companies.\nBecause mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, an important element of the Company\u2019s business strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of silver and gold mines, properties and businesses or interests therein. The Company\u2019s ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon success in further developing existing properties and developing or acquiring new mining properties. While initial development of major mining properties at Palmarejo, San Bartolom\u00e9, Rochester, and Kensington has been substantially completed, development work continues at Palmarejo, Rochester, and Kensington to expand these mines while using existing infrastructure. Since December 2012, the Company has owned 100% of the Joaquin silver-gold exploration project located in the Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina. As a result of its acquisition of Orko (now Coeur La Preciosa Silver Corp.) in April 2013, the Company also holds the La Preciosa silver-gold exploration project in the state of Durango, Mexico. The Company acquired the Wharf gold mine in February 2015 and Paramount in April 2015. The Company is also currently in the process of developing the Guadalupe and Independencia deposits at the Palmarejo complex and the Jualin deposit at Kensington. These strategies are inherently risky, and the Company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully develop existing or new mining properties or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all.\nThe Company expects to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and pursue those opportunities it believes are in the Company\u2019s long-term best interests. There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of any such acquisition will be realized. The success of any acquisition will depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to effectively manage the integration and operations of entities or properties it acquires and to realize other anticipated benefits. The process of managing acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of management resources, which may divert management\u2019s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters during this process.\nAny acquisition would be accompanied by risks, including:\n\u2022\na significant change in commodity or stock prices after the Company has committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio;\n\u2022\na material ore body may prove to be below expectations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization; and\n\u2022\nthe acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant.\nIn connection with an acquisition, the Company may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, resulting in increased interest expense, or dilution of the percentage ownership of existing stockholders. The Company cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of its common stock, or assure that it would be able to obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions, may negatively affect results of operations.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support the expansion of our operations resulting from an acquisition. The Company\u2019s future operating results could be affected by the ability of its officers and key employees to manage the changing business conditions and to integrate the acquired business into Coeur. There may also be liabilities, such as environmental liabilities, or significant capital expenditures that the Company failed to discover or have underestimated in connection with an acquisition. Any such liabilities or capital expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or future prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes it to risk of opportunity loss, mark-to-market fair value adjustments and exposure to counterparty credit risk.\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of silver and gold, foreign currency rates and changes in the prices of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other derivative instruments.\nThe use of derivative instruments can expose the Company to risk of an opportunity loss and may also result in significant mark-to-market fair value adjustments, which may have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. The Company is exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of nonperformance in connection with a contract, the Company could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract.\nThe Company is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks in the countries in which it has significant operations or interests.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues are generated by operations outside the United States, and it is subject to significant risks inherent in mineral extraction by foreign companies and contracts with government owned entities. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond the Company\u2019s control. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases, risks associated with the value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) recovery and collection process, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which operations are conducted. The right to export silver and gold may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities. In addition, the Company\u2019s rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups.\nAny of these developments could require the Company to curtail or terminate operations at its mines, incur significant costs to meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of VAT refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThese risks may be higher in developing countries in which the Company may expand its exploration for and development of mineral deposits. Potential operations in these areas increase the Company\u2019s exposure to risks of war, local economic conditions, political disruption, civil disturbance and governmental policies that may disrupt its operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities, including indigenous peoples, and other stakeholders in its operating locations. The Company believes its operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, the Company seeks to maintain its partnerships and relationships with local communities and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations. Notwithstanding the Company\u2019s ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with its activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against it. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks.\nThe Company\u2019s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of the Company\u2019s foreign operations, including drug-cartel related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of theft and greater risks as to personnel and property security. These conditions could lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, acts of civil disobedience are common in certain of the countries where the Company\u2019s operations are located. In recent years, many mining companies have been the targets of actions to restrict their legally-entitled access to mining concessions or property. Such acts of civil disobedience often occur with no warning and can result in significant direct and indirect costs. The Company cannot provide assurance that there will be no disruptions to site access in the future, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company sells silver and gold dor\u00e9 and concentrates in U.S. dollars, but it conducts operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe estimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated ore reserves may not be realized in actual production. The Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates.\nThe ore reserve figures presented in the Company\u2019s public filings are estimates made by the Company\u2019s technical personnel and independent mining consultants with whom the Company contracts. Reserve estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require the Company to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and silver and gold market prices. Reserve estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about silver and gold market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices fluctuate widely and have continued to fall over the past several years. Declines in the market prices of silver or gold may render reserves containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit, and the Company may be required to reduce reserve estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of its properties or write down assets as impaired. Should the Company encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of its mines or projects different from those predicted, it may adjust its reserve estimates and alter its mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affect actual production and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s estimates of future production, costs, and financial results are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors and may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates.\nThe Company has in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of its future production, costs and financial results. Any such information is forward-looking. Such estimates are made by the Company\u2019s management and technical personnel and depend on numerous assumptions, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of ore, the Company\u2019s costs of production, the market prices of silver and gold, the Company\u2019s ability to sustain and increase production levels, the sufficiency of its infrastructure, the performance of its personnel and equipment, its ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits and its compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any such production, cost, or financial results estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nForward sales, royalty arrangements, and certain derivative instruments can result in limiting the Company\u2019s ability to take advantage of increased metal prices while increasing its exposure to lower metal prices.\nThe Company has in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, arrangements under which it has agreed to make royalty or similar payments to lenders or other third parties in amounts that are based on expected production and price levels for silver or gold. The Company enters into such arrangements when it concludes that they provide it with necessary capital to develop a specific mining property or to achieve other business objectives. Royalty or similar payment obligations, however, can limit the Company\u2019s ability to realize the full effects of rising gold or silver prices and may require the Company to make potentially significant cash payments if the mine fails to achieve specified minimum production levels.\nThe Company\u2019s future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $490.4 million of outstanding indebtedness. In addition, the Company's total debt excludes $15.2 million for future minimum estimated gold production royalty payments due from Coeur Mexicana to Franco-Nevada. The liabilities associated with these gold production royalty payments increase as the price of gold increases. The Company\u2019s ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. The Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond its control, including the market prices of silver and gold. The Company may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments. If the Company cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service debt, it may need to further refinance debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain the necessary funds.\nThe Company cannot predict whether it would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase.\nThe terms of the Company\u2019s debt impose restrictions on its operations.\nThe agreements governing the Company\u2019s outstanding indebtedness include a number of significant negative covenants. These covenants, among other things:\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing, repurchase outstanding debt or equity or issue debt or equity securities;\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement governing the Company\u2019s outstanding indebtedness that, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted debt the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any debt could result in cross-defaults under the Company\u2019s other debt instruments. The Company\u2019s assets and cash flow may be insufficient to repay borrowings fully under all of its outstanding debt instruments if any of its debt instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, which could force the Company into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe Company might be unable to raise additional financing necessary to meet capital needs, conduct business, make payments when due or refinance debt.\nThe Company might need to raise additional funds in order to meet capital needs, implement its business plan, refinance debt or acquire complementary assets. Any required additional financing might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, holders of its common stock could experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights senior to those of the holders of common stock.\nAny downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to the Company\u2019s debt securities could increase future borrowing costs, adversely affect the availability of new financing and may result in increased collateral requirements under the Company\u2019s existing surety bond portfolio.\nThere can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services or Moody\u2019s Investors Service to the Company will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If the Company is unable to maintain its outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should the Company\u2019s business prospects or financial results deteriorate, including as a result of declines in silver and gold prices or other factors beyond our control, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s outstanding debt securities, its existing debt, and its ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, increase borrowing costs, and may result in increased collateral requirements under the Company\u2019s existing surety bond portfolio, which in turn may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.\nThe Company operates in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. The Company\u2019s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s internal control policies and procedures always will protect it from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the Company\u2019s affiliates, employees or agents. As such, the Company\u2019s corporate policies and processes may not prevent all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage the Company\u2019s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations.\nSignificant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration, development and mining activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to sustain or increase its present production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.\nMineral exploration, particularly for silver and gold, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; and issuance and maintenance of necessary permits. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.\nIn addition, exploration projects may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Exploration project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual operating costs and economic returns of any and all exploration projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.\nA significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates as a result of the unexpected discontinuation of purchases by smelter customers could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.\nThe Company currently sells gold concentrates to third-party smelters in China, Japan, and Australia. The loss of any one smelter could have a material adverse effect on the Company if alternative smelters were unavailable. The Company cannot ensure that alternative smelters would be available or offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations.\nThere are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.\nThe mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability.\nInsurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available. Any liabilities that the Company incurs for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to significant governmental regulations, including the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, and related costs and delays may negatively affect its business.\nMining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.\nU.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington, Rochester and Wharf mines are continuously inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (\u201cMSHA\u201d), which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Recently, MSHA has been conducting more frequent and more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. In addition, any of the Company\u2019s U.S. mines could be subject to a temporary or extended shutdown as a result of a violation alleged by MSHA. Parties engaged in mining operations or in the exploration or development of mineral properties may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may be subject to civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Any such penalties, fines, sanctions or shutdowns could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures.\nEnvironmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards, land development and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. The Company may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require it to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that the Company has made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that the Company currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in the Company\u2019s operations. The Company cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSome of the mining wastes from the Company\u2019s U.S. mines currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of EPA regulations governing hazardous waste under the RCRA. If the EPA were to repeal this exemption, and designate these mining wastes as hazardous under RCRA, the Company would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a U.S. mining facility, that facility could be designated as a \u201cSuperfund\u201d site under CERCLA. Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held jointly and severally liable regardless of fault, and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to federal, state and tribal governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on the Company\u2019s tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d), in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA, and in South Dakota under the South Dakota Water Pollution Control Act and the Administrative Rules of the State of South Dakota.\nAirborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada, Alaska and South Dakota. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory proposals related to climate change, including legislation pending in the U.S. Congress to require reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.\nContinuation of the Company\u2019s mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies.\nThe Company\u2019s mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. In particular, the Company\u2019s properties in Mexico are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of the Company\u2019s operating mines currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, the Company cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company\u2019s control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct the Company's operations. The loss of some or all water rights, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water could require the Company to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent the Company from pursuing expansion or development opportunities, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which the Company operates which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, thus adversely affecting the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company relies on third parties who own, maintain and operate the mines underlying its streaming and royalty assets.\nThe Endeavor mine is owned, maintained and operated by Cobar, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBH. However, pursuant to a silver sale and purchase agreement, the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, CDE Australia Pty. Ltd. (\u201cCDE Australia\u201d), has acquired all silver production and reserves at the Endeavor mine, up to a total of 20.0 million payable ounces. CDE Australia has agreed to pay Cobar an operating cost contribution of $1.00 for each ounce of payable silver, indexed annually for inflation, plus a further increment when the silver price exceeds $7.00 per ounce. In addition, the Company currently holds a tiered royalty on McEwen Mining Inc.\u2019s El Gallo complex in Mexico, currently paying a 3.5% NSR, a 1.5% NSR on Dynasty Metals & Mining, Inc.\u2019s Zaruma mine in Ecuador, a 2.0% NSR on Mandalay Resources Corp.\u2019s Cerro Bayo mine in Chile, and an 80% interest in a 2.5% royalty on OceanaGold Corporation's Correnso mine in New Zealand, as well as several royalties on mining assets that are not yet developed. The Company may acquire additional streaming and royalty interests in the future.\nThe Company relies on third parties to own, maintain and operate the mining projects underlying its royalty and streaming interests, which exposes it to substantial counterparty risk. These third parties may fail to adequately or appropriately operate or maintain their respective projects or may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under their agreements with the Company.\nThe Company cannot ensure that each of these third parties will not suffer financial hardship, will continue as a going concern or will not enter bankruptcy or otherwise liquidate. Any such event could expose the Company to significant costs and could limit the amounts, if any, the Company could recover in any proceeding against any such third party for breach of their agreement with the Company. There can be no assurance that the production from any of these mining operations will meet forecasted production targets. At any time, any of the owners or operators of these mining operations may decide to suspend or discontinue operations. In addition, the owners or operators of projects that are not yet operational in which the Company may hold royalty or streaming interests may decide to delay or not to proceed with commencing commercial production. Any failure, inability or refusal of a counterparty to meet its obligations to the Company under these royalty or streaming arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming. The Company\u2019s ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations can be materially affected by third party activists.\nIn the normal course of its business, the Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within the Company's control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority. The Company may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to its operations or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed the Company's expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the development or impede the operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect the Company's revenues and future growth. In addition, key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be changed in a manner that adversely affects the Company\u2019s operations.\nPrivate parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental\npermits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause the Company to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop, operate and expand mines and to conduct its operations will likely depend on the Company\u2019s ability to develop, operate, expand and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. The Company\u2019s ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with its activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which it operates.\nIn June 2013, Coeur submitted a proposed amendment to the plan of operations for the Rochester mine (\u201cPOA 10\u201d) to the BLM to expand leach pad capacity. Absent POA 10 approval, Coeur anticipates that the capacity under the existing leach pad will be insufficient after mid to late 2017. If POA 10 is not approved on a timely basis or at all, or if the permitting process is delayed for any reason, including to address public comments, the Company\u2019s plans for continued operations and future growth at Rochester could be materially adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems used in its operations are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various measures have been implemented to manage the Company\u2019s risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, the Company could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s exploration projects, La Preciosa and Joaquin, are subject to significant development, operational and regulatory risks.\nAs exploration projects, La Preciosa and Joaquin are subject to numerous risks. The economic feasibility of an exploration project is based on many factors such as: estimation of mineral reserves and mineralized material, anticipated metallurgical recoveries, environmental considerations and permitting, future metals prices, and anticipated capital and operating costs of these projects. For the La Preciosa project, the Company\u2019s 2014 feasibility study derived estimates of costs and economic returns based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of reserves to be mined and processed, the configuration of the mineral body, expected recovery rates, estimated expenditures, anticipated climatic conditions and other factors. As a result, it is possible that actual costs and economic returns will differ significantly from those estimated for the project in the feasibility study. For example, the significant decline in metals prices since the feasibility study, among other factors, has resulted in the reclassification of the mineral reserves previously declared at La Preciosa. When the Company ultimately determines to proceed with project construction, the Company may be unable to complete project and environmental permitting within an economically acceptable time frame.\nAs a result of these and related risks, future estimates of or actual costs and economic returns of the La Preciosa and Joaquin projects may materially differ from the estimated costs and returns for these projects.\nThe Company\u2019s operations in Bolivia are subject to political risks.\nIn May 2014, the new Bolivian mining law was enacted. The Company has been assessing the potential effects of the legislation on its Bolivian operations but any effects remain uncertain until the regulations implementing the law are enacted. The law regulates royalties and provides for mining contracts with the government rather than concession holding. If the regulations promulgated under the new mining law mandate a renegotiation of the terms of our existing contracts with the Bolivian state-\nowned mining company, Corporacion Minera de Bolivia (\u201cCOMIBOL\u201d) and the mining cooperatives, this could materially adversely affect the profitability and cash flow of our operations in Bolivia. It is also uncertain if any new mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may further affect mining in Bolivia.\nIn addition, companies are also operating under Law No. 403 of September 18, 2013, and its regulatory Supreme Decree, which provides for the reversion of mining rights if the Ministry of Mines verifies that a person with mining rights has not initiated mining activities or developed the mining rights. The contracts with COMIBOL and the cooperatives are excluded from the application of Law No. 403. In April 2014, our subsidiary in Bolivia was served by the Bolivian government with a reversion decision affecting nine mining rights wholly-owned by our subsidiary. The affected area is not in an area of active mining by the Company and the Company\u2019s San Bartolom\u00e9 operations were not targeted as an area of interest in the decision since all of our past and current mining activity is performed through our contracts with COMIBOL and the mining cooperatives.\nOn October 14, 2009, the Bolivian state-owned mining organization, COMIBOL, announced by resolution that it was temporarily suspending mining activities above the elevation of 4,400 meters above sea level while stability studies of Cerro Rico mountain are undertaken. The Company holds rights to mine above this elevation under valid contracts with COMIBOL as well as under authorized contracts with local mining cooperatives that hold their rights under contract themselves with COMIBOL. The stability studies have been completed and officially submitted to the Bolivian mining technical authorities. Accordingly, the COMIBOL suspension has expired in accordance with the terms of the resolution. As a result of the resolution, the Company temporarily adjusted its mine plan to confine mining activities to the ore deposits below 4,400 meters above sea level and timely notified COMIBOL of the need to lift the restriction. The Cooperative Reserva Fiscal, with whom the Company has one of those contracts, subsequently interpreted the COMIBOL resolution and determined that the Huacajchi deposit was not covered by such resolution. In March 2010, the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal notified COMIBOL that, based on its interpretation, it was resuming mining of high grade material above the 4,400 meter level in the Huacajchi deposit. In December 2011, the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal sent a similar notification to COMIBOL with respect to a further area above the 4,400 meter level known as Huacajchi Sur. Based on these notifications and on the absence of any objection from COMIBOL, the Company resumed limited mining operations at the San Bartolom\u00e9 mine on the Huacajchi deposit and Huacajchi Sur. Despite the fact that the COMIBOL suspension has expired, the Company has not resumed mining in other areas above the 4,400 meter level due to community relations concerns and the current political climate in Bolivia.\nWhile the COMIBOL suspension has expired, it is uncertain at this time how long the Company will continue to suspend its mining operations in areas above the 4,400 meter level other than at Huacajchi and Huacajchi Sur. If COMIBOL decides to affirmatively adopt a new resolution to restrict access above the 4,400 meter level on a permanent basis, the Company may need to further write down the carrying value of the asset. While a portion of the Company's proven and probable reserves relate to material above the 4,400 meter level at San Bartolom\u00e9, so long as operations remain suspended, there is a risk that silver may not be produced from this material at expected levels or at all, particularly given the remaining anticipated mine life of this asset. It is also uncertain if any new mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may affect mining in Bolivia.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on good relations with its employees.\nThe Company may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect its business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. During the past three years, two of the Company\u2019s mines have experienced work stoppages, each of which was resolved within a short period of time and had no material effect on results of operations or financial condition. The Company cannot assure that work stoppages or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose the Company to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2015, unions represented approximately 11% of the Company\u2019s global workforce, all of which were comprised of workers at the San Bartolom\u00e9 mine in Bolivia. The Company has a labor agreement at the San Bartolom\u00e9 mine which is in effect for 2016. The Company cannot predict whether this agreement will be renewed on similar terms or at all, whether future labor disruptions will occur or, if disruptions do occur, how long they will last.\nDisputes regarding the Company\u2019s mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of the Company\u2019s mining projects or conservation efforts involving U.S. federal lands could adversely impact operations.\nThe validity of mining or exploration claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of the Company\u2019s property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. The Company has used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standard, to investigate its title or claims to its various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining claims, concessions or\nrights or that such exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties. Although the Company has attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice it does not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of the Company\u2019s exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting its business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Company\u2019s projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations. A defect could result in the Company losing all or a portion of its right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.\nIn Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, ejidos control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While the Company has agreements or is in the process of negotiating agreements with the ejidos that impact all of its projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation. In Bolivia, we obtain surface rights from cooperatives, through a series of \u201cjoint venture\u201d contracts. Changes to the existing agreements or leases or failure to reach agreement in any negotiations may have a significant impact on operations at the Company\u2019s projects and may, on occasion, lead to litigation. Further, the Bolivian government under Law No. 403 may have the ability to reverse our wholly-owned mining rights. Any such reversion decision could adversely impact our future mining plans.\nIn addition, U.S. environmental conservation efforts could result in the withdrawal of certain federal lands from mineral entry under the Mining Law, which could have the effect of restricting the Company\u2019s current or future planned activities involving its unpatented mining claims on the affected public lands.\nThe Company is subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.\nThe Company is currently, and may in the future become, subject to other litigation, arbitration or proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to the Company, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against the Company in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event of a dispute arising at the Company\u2019s foreign operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. The Company\u2019s inability to enforce its rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of its issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of its common stock.\nThe issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of the Company's existing stockholders' equity ownership. The Company is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of its common stock. If the Company issues additional equity securities, the price of its common stock may be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 24441, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "CDE"}
