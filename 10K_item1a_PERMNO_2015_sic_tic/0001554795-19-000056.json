{"cik": "1060219", "company": "SALISBURY BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSalisbury is the registered bank holding company for the Bank, its wholly-owned subsidiary. Salisbury's business and activity is currently limited to the holding of the Bank's outstanding capital stock, and the Bank is Salisbury's primary investment.\nAn investment in Salisbury common stock entails certain risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the Bank\u2019s business. Salisbury considers the most significant factors of which we are aware affecting risk in Salisbury common stock as those that are set forth below. These are not the only risks to which an investment in Salisbury common stock is subject, and none of the factors set forth below relates to the personal circumstances of individual investors. Investors should read this entire Form 10-K, as well as other documents and exhibits that are incorporated by reference in the 10-K and that have been filed with the SEC, in order to better understand these risks and to evaluate investment in Salisbury common stock.\nChanges in interest rates and spreads could have a negative impact on earnings and financial condition.\nSalisbury\u2019s earnings and financial condition are dependent to a large degree upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest rate spreads, meaning the difference between interest rates earned on loans and investments, and the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings, could adversely affect Salisbury\u2019s earnings and financial condition. Salisbury cannot predict with certainty or control changes in interest rates. Global, national, regional, and local economic conditions and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the FRB, affect interest income and interest expense. Salisbury has ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates.\nHowever, changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on Salisbury\u2019s profitability. For example, high interest rates could also affect the volume of loans that Salisbury originates, because higher rates could cause customers to apply for fewer mortgages, or cause depositors to shift funds from accounts that have a comparatively lower rate, to accounts with a higher rate, or experience customer attrition due to competitor pricing or disintermediation. If the cost of interest-bearing deposits increases at a rate greater than the yields on interest-earning assets increase, net interest income will be negatively affected. Changes in the asset and liability mix may also affect net interest income. Similarly, lower interest rates cause higher yielding assets to prepay and floating or adjustable rate assets to reset to lower rates. If Salisbury is not able to reduce its funding costs sufficiently, due to either competitive factors or the maturity schedule of existing liabilities, then Salisbury\u2019s net interest margin will decline.\nWeakness in the markets for residential or commercial real estate, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, could reduce Salisbury\u2019s net income and profitability.\nDeclines in home prices, increases in delinquency and default rates, and constrained secondary credit markets affect the mortgage industry generally. Salisbury\u2019s financial results may be adversely affected by changes in real estate values. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans and investments. If poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, Salisbury\u2019s net income and profits may decrease.\nWeakness in the secondary market for residential lending could have an adverse impact upon Salisbury\u2019s profitability. The effects of ongoing mortgage market challenges, combined with the ongoing correction in residential real estate market prices and reduced levels of home sales, could result in further price reductions in single family home values, adversely affecting the value of collateral securing mortgage loans held, mortgage loan originations and gains on sale of mortgage loans. Declines in real estate values and home sales volumes, and financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses, or other factors, could have further adverse effects on borrowers that result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods beyond that which is provided for in Salisbury\u2019s allowance for loan losses, which would adversely affect Salisbury\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nFluctuations in economic conditions and collateral values could impact the adequacy of Salisbury\u2019s allowance for loan losses.\nSalisbury\u2019s business is subject to periodic fluctuations based on national and local economic conditions. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on Salisbury\u2019s operations and financial condition. For example, declines in housing activity including declines in building permits, housing sales and home prices may make it more difficult for Salisbury\u2019s borrowers to sell their homes or refinance their debt. Slow sales could strain the resources of real estate developers and builders. The ongoing economic uncertainty has affected employment levels and could impact the ability of Salisbury\u2019s borrowers to service their debt. Bank regulatory agencies also periodically review Salisbury\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses Salisbury will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on Salisbury\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Salisbury may suffer higher loan losses as a result of these factors and the resulting impact on its borrowers.\nCredit market conditions may impact Salisbury\u2019s investments.\nSignificant credit market anomalies may impact the valuation and liquidity of Salisbury\u2019s investment securities. Illiquidity could reduce the market value of Salisbury\u2019s investments, even those with no apparent credit exposure. The valuation of Salisbury\u2019s investments requires judgment, and as market conditions change investment values may also change.\nSalisbury\u2019s securities portfolio performance in difficult market conditions could have adverse effects on Salisbury\u2019s results of operations.\nUnder GAAP, Salisbury is required to review Salisbury\u2019s investment portfolio periodically for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment of its securities, taking into consideration current market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, volatility of earnings, current analysts\u2019 evaluations, Salisbury\u2019s ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of amortized cost, as well as other factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the foregoing factors may require Salisbury to deem particular securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired, with the credit related portion of the reduction in the value recognized as a charge to Salisbury\u2019s earnings. Market volatility may make it extremely difficult to value certain securities of Salisbury. Subsequent valuations, in light of factors prevailing at that time, may result in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods. Any of these factors could require Salisbury to recognize further impairments in the value of Salisbury\u2019s securities portfolio, which may have an adverse effect on Salisbury\u2019s results of operations in future periods.\nIf the goodwill that Salisbury has recorded in connection with its acquisitions becomes impaired, it could have a negative impact on Salisbury\u2019s profitability.\nApplicable accounting standards require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Under purchase accounting, if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of the acquired company\u2019s net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirer\u2019s balance sheet as goodwill. At December 31, 2018, Salisbury had $13.8 million of goodwill on its balance sheet. Salisbury must evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. Write-downs of the amount of any impairment, if necessary, are to be charged to the results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs. There can be no assurance that future evaluations of goodwill will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on Salisbury\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSalisbury\u2019s ability to pay dividends substantially depends upon its receipt of dividends from the Bank.\nCash dividends from the Bank and Salisbury\u2019s liquid assets are the principal sources of funds for paying cash dividends on Salisbury\u2019s common stock. Unless Salisbury receives dividends from the Bank or chooses to use its liquid assets, it may not be able to pay dividends. The Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to Salisbury is subject to its condition and profitability as well as its regulatory requirements.\nStrong competition within Salisbury\u2019s market areas may limit growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. Salisbury competes with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. As Salisbury grows, it may expand into contiguous market areas where it may not be as well-known as other institutions that have been operating in those areas for some time. In addition, larger banking institutions may become increasingly active in Salisbury\u2019s market areas, may have substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer certain services that Salisbury does not, or cannot efficiently, provide. Salisbury\u2019s profitability depends upon its continued ability to successfully compete in its market areas. The greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some competitors may limit its ability to grow profitably.\nSalisbury and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision.\nSalisbury and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These regulations affect Salisbury\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, and dividend policy and growth, among other things. State and federal legislatures and regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect Salisbury in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject Salisbury to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products it may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on Salisbury\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. While Salisbury has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. See the section captioned \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in Item 1 of this report for further information.\nSalisbury\u2019s stock price may be volatile.\nSalisbury\u2019s stock is inactively traded and its stock price may fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors including:\n\u2022 Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results\n\u2022 Recommendations by securities analysts\n\u2022 New technology used, or services offered, by competitors\n\u2022 Significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving Salisbury or Salisbury\u2019s competitors\n\u2022 Failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions\n\u2022 Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to Salisbury\n\u2022 News reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry\n\u2022 Changes in government regulations\n\u2022 Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts\n\u2022 Changes in the economic environment of the market areas the Bank serves\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes, credit loss trends or currency fluctuations could also cause Salisbury\u2019s stock price to decrease regardless of Salisbury\u2019s operating results.\nSalisbury\u2019s ability to attract and retain skilled personnel may impact its success.\nSalisbury\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for people with specialized knowledge and skills can be intense, and Salisbury may not be able to hire people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of Salisbury\u2019s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the business because of their skills, knowledge of the market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nSalisbury continually encounters technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology can increase efficiency and enable financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. However, some new technologies needed to compete effectively result in incremental operating costs. Salisbury\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Many of Salisbury\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Salisbury may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on Salisbury\u2019s business and, in turn, its financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure involving controls and procedures may have an adverse effect on Salisbury.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates Salisbury\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Salisbury\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf customer information was to be misappropriated and used fraudulently, due to a breach of our systems, or those of third party vendors or service providers, including as a result of cyberattacks, Salisbury could be exposed to potential liability and reputation risk as well as increased costs.\nRisk of theft of customer information resulting from security breaches by third parties exposes banks to reputation risk and potential monetary loss. Like other financial institutions, Salisbury has exposure to fraudulent misuse of its customers\u2019 personal information resulting from its general business operations through loss or theft of the information and through misappropriation of information by third parties in connection with customer use of financial instruments, such as debit cards.\nIn addition, Salisbury relies upon a variety of computing platforms and networks over the internet for the purposes of data processing, communications and information exchange. Despite the safeguards instituted by Salisbury, any system is susceptible to a breach of security. In addition, Salisbury relies on the services of a variety of third party vendors to meet Salisbury\u2019s data processing and communication needs. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of Salisbury\u2019s information systems or that of its vendors could damage Salisbury\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business or expose Salisbury to civil litigation and possible financial loss. Such costs and/or losses could materially impact Salisbury\u2019s earnings.\nChanges in accounting standards can materially impact Salisbury\u2019s financial statements.\nSalisbury\u2019s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Salisbury records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or regulatory authorities change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Salisbury\u2019s financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how Salisbury records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, Salisbury could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in Salisbury restating prior period financial statements.\nChanges and interpretations of tax laws and regulations may adversely impact Salisbury\u2019s financial statements.\nLocal, state or federal tax authorities may interpret tax laws and regulations differently than Salisbury and challenge tax positions that Salisbury has taken on its tax returns. This may result in the disallowance of deductions or differences in the timing of deductions and result in the payment of additional taxes, interest or penalties that could materially affect Salisbury\u2019s performance.\nIn addition, changes in tax law, such as the federal tax reform provisions recently enacted, may adversely affect Salisbury\u2019s lending business and performance, especially those provisions regarding the deductibility of residential mortgage interest and state property taxes.\nThe risks presented by recent or future acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business strategy has included, and may continue to include, growth through acquisition from time to time. Any recent and future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks may include, among other things: our ability to realize anticipated cost savings; the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel; the loss of key employees; the potential disruption of our or the acquired company\u2019s ongoing business in such a way that could result in decreased revenues; the inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position; the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and the impairment of relationships with the acquired company\u2019s employees and customers as a result of changes in ownership and management.", "PERMNO": 86312, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SAL"}
