{"cik": "1620179", "company": "Quinpario Acquisition Corp. 2", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the material risks described below, which we believe represent the material risks related to our business and our securities, together with the other information contained in this Form 10-K, before making a decision to invest in our securities. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below.\nIn addition to the risks and uncertainties set forth below, we face certain material risks and uncertainties related to the business combination with Novitex and SourceHOV. In addition, if we succeed in effecting the business combination, we will face additional and different risks and uncertainties related to the business of Novitex and SourceHOV. Such material risks will be set forth in the proxy statement that we will file with the SEC in connection with the meeting to be called to approve the business combination.\nWe are a blank check company with no operating history and, accordingly, you will not have any basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nWe are a blank check company with no operating results to date. Our business objective is to complete the business combination with Novitex and SourceHOV. We will not generate any revenues until, at the earliest, after the consummation of our initial business combination.\nIf we are unable to consummate an initial business combination, investors\u2019 funds may be unavailable to them until we make liquidation distributions.\nIf we are unable to consummate an initial business combination, investors\u2019 funds may be unavailable to them until we make liquidating distributions. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to such date unless we consummate a business combination prior thereto and only then in cases where investors have sought to convert their shares. Accordingly, investors\u2019 funds may be unavailable to them until after such date and to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your securities potentially at a loss.\nIn connection with our proposed business combination, we will issue shares of our capital stock and incur significant indebtedness.\nIn connection with our proposed business combination, we will issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock:\n\u25cf may significantly reduce the equity interest of investors;\n\u25cf may subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded to our shares of common stock;\n\u25cf may cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u25cf may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares of common stock.\nAdditionally, we will incur significant indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, which could result in:\n\u25cf default and foreclosure on our assets if our profits after our initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n\u25cf acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\u25cf our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and\n\u25cf our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding.\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-share redemption price received by stockholders may be less than $10.00.\nOur placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors and service providers we engage and prospective target businesses we negotiate with execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, they may not execute such agreements. Furthermore, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they may seek recourse against the trust account. A court may not uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to claims which could take priority over those of our public stockholders. If we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period, Quinpario Partners LLC and Mr. Quinn have agreed that they will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but only if such a vendor or prospective target business does not execute such a waiver. However, they may not be able to meet such obligation. Therefore, the distribution from the trust account to each holder of shares of common stock may be less than $10.00, plus interest, due to such claims.\nAdditionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we may not be able to return to our holders of shares of common stock at least $10.00.\nOur stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.\nIf we have not completed our initial business combination by the required time period as described herein, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption as part of a single integrated transaction, dissolve and liquidate, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors (who have contractually agreed to take such actions to effectuate such dissolution and liquidation), subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We may not properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of the date of distribution. Accordingly, third parties may seek to recover from our stockholders amounts owed to them by us.\nIf we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account promptly to our public stockholders, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public holders of common stock from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons.\nIf we do not maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, public holders will only be able to exercise such warrants on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d\nIf we do not maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants at the time that holders wish to exercise such warrants, they will only be able to exercise them on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d As a result, the number of shares of common stock that holders will receive upon exercise of the public warrants will be fewer than it would have been had such holders exercised their warrants for cash. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to meet these conditions and to maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. If we are unable to do so, the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company may be reduced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Private Placement Warrants and any other warrants that may be issued to our officers, directors, sponsor or their affiliates as described elsewhere in this Form 10-K may be exercisable for unregistered shares of common stock for cash even if the prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not current and effective.\nAn investor will only be able to exercise a warrant if the issuance of shares upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or is deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants.\nNo public warrants will be exercisable for cash and we will not be obligated to issue shares of common stock unless the shares issuable upon such exercise have been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. At the time that the warrants become exercisable, we expect to continue to be listed on a national securities exchange, which would provide an exemption from registration in every state. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside, the warrants may be deprived of any value, the market for the warrants may be limited and they may expire worthless if they cannot be sold.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a way that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding warrants.\nOur warrants have been issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision. The warrant agreement requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants approve such amendment.\nOur officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby potentially limiting the amount of time they devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our initial business combination.\nOur officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs, which could create a conflict of interest when allocating their time between our operations and their other commitments. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. All of our officers and directors are engaged in several other business endeavors and are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs. If our officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 other business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to such affairs, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our initial business combination. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor.\nOur officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 personal and financial interests may have influenced their motivation in determining whether our proposed business combination is appropriate.\nOur sponsor and our officers and directors have waived their right to convert their insider shares or any other shares of common stock acquired in our initial public offering or thereafter, or to receive distributions with respect to their insider shares upon our liquidation if we are unable to consummate our initial business combination. Accordingly, the insider shares will be worthless if we do not consummate our initial business combination. The Private Placement Warrants and any other warrants they acquire will also be worthless if we do not consummate an initial business combination. The personal and financial interests of our sponsor, officers and directors may have influenced their motivation in selecting Novitex and SourceHOV as target businesses.\nNasdaq may delist our securities from quotation on its exchange which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur securities are listed on Nasdaq, a national securities exchange. However, we cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq in the future prior to an initial business combination. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in stockholders\u2019 equity (generally $2,500,000) and a minimum number of holders of our securities (generally 300 round-lot holders). On January 5, 2017, we received a notice from Nasdaq stating that we failed to hold an annual meeting of stockholders within 12 months after our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rules 5620(a) and 5810(c)(2)(G). We intend to regain compliance with these rules by holding the meeting in connection with asking stockholders to approve our initial business combination. However, there is no assurance that Nasdaq will not seek to delist our securities prior to this time.\nAdditionally, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on NASDAQ. We may not be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.\nIf Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our shares of common stock are \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe will offer each public stockholder the option to vote in favor of the proposed business combination and still seek conversion of his, her or its shares.\nIn connection with the meeting held to approve an initial business combination, we will offer each public stockholder (but not our other initial stockholders) the right to have his, her or its public shares converted for cash (subject to the limitations described elsewhere in this Form 10-K) regardless of whether such stockholder votes for or against such proposed business combination. This is different than other similarly structured blank check companies where stockholders are offered the right to have their shares converted only when they vote against a proposed business combination. Accordingly, public stockholders owning a majority of the shares sold in our initial public offering may exercise their conversion rights and we could still consummate a proposed business combination so long as a majority of shares voted at the meeting are voted in favor of the proposed business combination. The ability to seek conversion while voting in favor of a proposed business combination may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination.\nPublic stockholders, together with any affiliates of theirs or any other person with whom they are acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup,\u201d will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to more than 15% of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering.\nWe will offer each public stockholder (but not our initial stockholders) the right to have his, her, or its shares of common stock converted into cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to more than 15% of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering. Generally, in this context, a stockholder will be deemed to be acting in concert or as a group with another stockholder when such stockholders agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring, voting, holding or disposing of our equity securities. Accordingly, if you hold more than 15% of the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering and our proposed business combination is approved, you will not be able to seek conversion rights with respect to the full amount of your shares and may be forced to hold such additional shares of common stock or sell them in the open market. The value of such additional shares may not appreciate over time following our initial business combination, and the market price of our shares of common stock may not exceed the per-share conversion price.\nWe may require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.\nIn connection with the stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, each public stockholder will have the right, regardless of whether it is voting for or against such proposed business combination, to demand that we convert its public shares for a share of the trust account. We may require public stockholders who wish to have their shares converted in connection with a proposed business combination to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time prior to the vote taken at the stockholder meeting relating to such business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder\u2019s option. In order to obtain a physical share certificate, a stockholder\u2019s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and our transfer agent will need to act to facilitate this request. It is our understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because we do not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, it may take significantly longer than two weeks to obtain a physical share certificate. While we have been advised that it takes a short time to deliver shares through the DWAC System, this may not be the case. Accordingly, if it takes longer than we anticipate for stockholders to deliver their shares, stockholders who wish to convert may be unable to meet the deadline for exercising their conversion rights and thus may be unable to convert their shares.\nIf, in connection with the stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed business combination, we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock to comply with the delivery requirements for conversion, such converting stockholders may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed business combination is not approved.\nIf we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock to comply with specific delivery requirements for conversion described above and such proposed business combination is not consummated, we will promptly return such certificates to the tendering public stockholders. Accordingly, investors who attempted to convert their shares in such a circumstance will be unable to sell their securities after the failed acquisition until we have returned their securities to them. The market price for our shares may decline during this time and you may not be able to sell your securities when you wish to, even while other stockholders that did not seek conversion may be able to sell their securities.\nOur initial stockholders control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.\nOur initial stockholders collectively own approximately 28.6% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. In connection with any vote for a proposed business combination, all of our initial stockholders, as well as all of our officers and directors, have agreed to vote the shares of common stock owned by them immediately before our initial public offering as well as any shares of common stock acquired in our initial public offering or in the aftermarket in favor of such proposed business combination.\nOur board of directors is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a consequence of our \u201cstaggered\u201d board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election in any annual meeting and our initial stockholders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our initial stockholders may continue to exert control at least until the consummation of a business combination.\nOur outstanding warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of shares of common stock.\nWe have issued warrants to purchase 17,500,000 shares of common stock as part of the units offered by our initial public offering and the Private Placement Warrants to purchase 9,000,000 shares of common stock. We may also issue additional warrants to our officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of promissory notes issued to such entities or individuals for loans made to supplement our working capital requirements. The sale, or even the possibility of sale, of the shares underlying the warrants could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future financing. If and to the extent these warrants are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings.\nOur management\u2019s ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of common stock upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash.\nIf we call our public warrants for redemption, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise its warrant (including any warrants held by our sponsor, officers, directors or their permitted transferees) to do so on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d If our management chooses to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the number of shares of common stock received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination.\nA company that, among other things, is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, trading or holding certain types of securities would be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Since we will invest the proceeds held in the trust account, it is possible that we could be deemed an investment company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act of 1940. To this end, the proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trustee only in United States government treasury bills, notes or bonds having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States treasuries. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nIf we are nevertheless deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, we may be subject to certain restrictions that may make it more difficult for us to complete a business combination, including:\n\u25cf restrictions on the nature of our investments; and\n\u25cf restrictions on the issuance of securities.\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us certain burdensome requirements, including:\n\u25cf registration as an investment company;\n\u25cf adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\u25cf reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy, compliance policies and procedures and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nCompliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expense for which we have not allotted.\nWe did not obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire and therefore you may be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed business combination.\nWe did not obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire. Accordingly, investors will be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed business combination.\nCompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls and may require that we have such system of internal controls audited. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm report on management\u2019s evaluation of our system of internal controls. As an accelerated filer, we would be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting if we would cease being an emerging growth company. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. Furthermore, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our securities less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period or revenues exceeds $1 billion, or the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we are not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and we are exempt from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Additionally, as an emerging growth company, we have elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As such, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares of common stock less attractive because we may rely on these provisions. If some investors find our shares of common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our shares and our share price may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, will not adopt the new or revised standard until the time private companies are required to adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a result, at a given annual meeting only one-third of the board of directors may be considered for election. Since our \u201cstaggered board\u201d may prevent our stockholders from replacing a majority of our board of directors at any given annual meeting, it may entrench management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals that may be in the best interests of stockholders. Moreover, our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.", "PERMNO": 15271, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "XELA"}
