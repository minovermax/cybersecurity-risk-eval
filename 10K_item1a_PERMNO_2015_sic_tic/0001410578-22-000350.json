{"cik": "947559", "company": "FIRST BANCSHARES INC /MS/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to risk. The following discussion, along with management\u2019s discussion and analysis and our financial statements and footnotes, sets forth the most significant risks and uncertainties that we believe could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. There is no assurance that this discussion covers all potential risks that we face. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made herein.\nRisk Factors Associated with Our Business\nGeneral economic conditions in the areas where our operations or loans are concentrated may adversely affect our financial results or liquidity.\nA sudden or severe downturn in the economy in the geographic markets we serve in the states of Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida or Georgia may affect the ability of our customers to meet loan payment obligations on a timely basis. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on our commercial, real estate, and construction loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing such loans. Any deterioration in the economic conditions of these market areas could negatively impact the financial results of the Company\u2019s banking operations, earnings, and profitability.\nOur Bank requires liquidity in the form of available funds to meet its deposit, debt and other obligations as they come due, borrower requests to draw on committed credit facilities as well as unexpected demands for cash payments. Adverse economic changes may cause customers to withdraw deposit balances, thereby causing a strain on our liquidity. We have historically had access to a number of alternative sources of liquidity, but if there is an increase in volatility in the credit and liquidity markets there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such liquidity on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nWe may be vulnerable to certain sectors of the economy, including real estate.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a relatively short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. If the economy deteriorates and real estate values decline materially, a significant part of our loan portfolio could become under-collateralized\nand losses incurred upon borrower defaults would increase. This could result in additional loan loss accruals which would negatively impact our earnings. Our ability to dispose of foreclosed real estate at prices above the respective carrying values could also be impacted, which could cause our results of operations to be adversely affected.\nUnpredictable market conditions may adversely affect the industry in which we operate.\nThe capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption. Dramatic declines in the housing market in years past caused home prices to fall and increased foreclosures, unemployment and under-employment. These events, if they were to happen again, could negatively impact the credit performance of mortgage loans and result in significant write-downs of asset values, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks. Market turmoil and tightening of credit could lead to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence and widespread reduction of business activity. Generally, a worsening of these conditions would have an adverse effect on us and others in the financial institution industry, particularly in our real estate markets, as lower home prices and increased foreclosures would result in higher charge-offs and delinquencies.\nThe state of the economy and various economic factors, including inflation, recession, unemployment, interest rates and the level of U.S. debt, as well as governmental action and uncertainty resulting from U.S. and global political trends, may directly and indirectly, have a destabilizing effect on our financial condition and results of operations. An unfavorable or uncertain national or regional political or economic environment could drive losses beyond those which are provided for in our allowance for loan losses and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe must maintain an appropriate allowance for credit losses.\nThe First, as lender, is exposed to the risk that its customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Credit risk with respect to our real estate and construction loan portfolio relates principally to the creditworthiness of the borrower corporations and the value of the real estate serving as security for the repayment of loans. Credit risk with respect to our commercial and consumer loan portfolio will relate principally to the general creditworthiness of the borrower businesses and individuals within our local markets.\nOn January 1, 2021, the Company adopted the ASC 326. The FASB issued ASC 326 to replace the incurred loss model for loans and other financial assets with an expected loss model and requires consideration of a wider range of reasonable and supportable information to determine credit losses. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company has developed an allowance for credit losses (\u201cACL\u201d) methodology effective January 1, 2021, which replaces its previous allowance for loan losses methodology. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from loans\u2019 amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged-off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environment conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant factors. Management may selectively apply external market data to subjectively adjust the Company\u2019s own loss history including index or peer data. Management evaluates the adequacy of the ACL quarterly and makes provisions for credit losses based on this evaluation. See Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nWe are subject to risks related to changes in market interest rates.\nOur assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature, and as a result we are subject to significant risks resulting from changes in interest rates. Our profitability is largely dependent upon net interest income. Unexpected movement in interest rates markedly changing the slope of the current yield curve could cause net interest margins to decrease, subsequently decreasing net interest income. In addition, such changes could adversely affect the valuation of our assets and liabilities.\nThe fair market value of the securities portfolio and the investment income from these securities also fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.\nAt present the Company\u2019s one-year interest rate sensitivity position is asset sensitive. As with most financial institutions, the Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by changes in interest rates and the Company\u2019s ability to manage this risk. The difference between interest rates charged on interest-earning assets and interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities may be affected by changes in market interest rates, changes in relationships between interest rate indices, and/or changes in the relationships between long-term and short-term market interest rates. A change in this difference might result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income, or a decrease in the Company\u2019s interest rate spread.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, for our variable rate loans and the interest expense paid on our subordinated notes and our subordinated debentures.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the LIBOR administration after 2021. In November 2020, the FCA announced it will consult on its intention to extend the retirement date of certain offered rates whereby the publication of the one week and two month LIBOR offered rates will cease after December 31, 2021; but the publication of the remaining LIBOR offered rates will continue until June 20, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rate Committee has announced secured overnight financing rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its recommended alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by the U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately $55.3 million or 1.9% of our outstanding loans were indexed to 30-day, 90-day, and one-year LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR has resulted in and could continue to result in added costs and employee efforts and could present additional risk. We are subject to litigation and reputational risks if we are unable to renegotiate and amend existing contracts with counterparties that are dependent on LIBOR, including contracts that do not have fallback language.\nUncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, the replacement or disappearance of LIBOR or other reforms may adversely affect the value of and the return on our subordinated notes and our subordinated debentures, as well as the interest we pay on those securities.\nCertain changes in interest rates, inflation, or the financial markets could affect demand for our products and our ability to deliver products efficiently.\nLoan originations, and therefore loan revenues, could be adversely impacted by rising interest rates. Increases in market interest rates can have negative impacts on our business, including reducing our customers\u2019 desire to borrow money from us or adversely affecting their ability to repay their outstanding loans by increasing their debt service obligations through the periodic reset of adjustable interest rate loans. If our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans is impaired by increasing interest payment obligations, our level of non-performing assets would increase, producing an adverse effect on operating results. Asset values, especially commercial real estate as collateral, securities or other fixed rate earning assets, can decline significantly with relatively minor changes in interest rates. If interest rates were to decrease, our yield on our variable rate loans and on our new loans would decrease, reducing our net interest income. In addition, lower interest rates may reduce our realized yields on investment securities, which would reduce our net interest income and cause downward pressure on net interest margin in future periods. A significant reduction in our net interest income could have a material adverse impact on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nContinued increases in inflation could cause operating costs related to salaries and benefits, technology, and supplies to increase at a faster pace than revenues.\nEvaluation of investment securities for impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuers\u2019 financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. Estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. The determination of the amount of impairments is based upon the Company\u2019s quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nAdditionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its reasonable judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management\u2019s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Impairments to the carrying value of our investment securities may need to be taken in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could adversely affect profitability.\nThe results of operations of the Company are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which we refer to as the Federal Reserve Board. The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve Board include open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and monetary policy, we cannot predict the impact of future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand or the Company\u2019s business and earnings. Furthermore, the actions of the United States government and other governments in responding to developing situations or implementing new fiscal or trade policies may result in currency fluctuations, exchange controls, market disruption and other unanticipated economic effects. Such actions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nWe are subject to regulation by various Federal and State entities.\nThe Company and The First are subject to extensive regulation by various regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance and the CFPB. See Supervision and Regulation above for more information. New regulations issued by these agencies may adversely affect our ability to carry on our business activities. The Company is subject to various Federal and state laws and certain changes in these laws and regulations may adversely affect operations.\nThe Company and The First are also subject to the accounting rules and regulations of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the reported financial statements or results of operations of the Company and may also require extraordinary efforts or additional costs to implement. Any of these laws or regulations may be modified or changed from time to time, and we cannot be assured that such modifications or changes will not adversely affect the Company.\nThe full impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") on us and our customers is unknown at present, creating uncertainty and risk related to our customers\u2019 future demand for credit and our future results.\nIncreased economic activity expected to result from the decrease in tax rates on businesses generally could spur additional economic activity that would encourage additional borrowing. At the same time, some customers may elect to use their additional cash flow from lower taxes to fund their existing levels of activity, decreasing borrowing needs. The elimination of the federal income tax deductibility of business interest expense for a significant number of our customers effectively increases the cost of borrowing and makes equity or hybrid funding relatively more attractive. This could have a long-term negative impact on business customer borrowing. Some or all of this benefit could be lost to the extent that the banks and financial services companies we compete with elect to lower interest rates and fees and we are forced to respond in order to remain competitive. Additionally, the tax benefits could be repealed as a result of future regulatory actions. There is no assurance that presently anticipated benefits of the Tax Act for the Company will be realized.\nWe may be required to pay additional insurance premiums to the FDIC, which could negatively impact earnings.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the limit on FDIC coverage has been permanently increased to $250,000, causing the premiums assessed to The First by the FDIC to increase. Depending upon any future losses that the FDIC insurance fund may suffer, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional premium increases in order to replenish the fund. The FDIC may need to set a higher base rate schedule or impose special assessments due to future financial institution failures and updated failure and loss projections. Potentially higher FDIC assessment rates than those currently projected could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to industry competition which may have an adverse impact upon our success.\nThe profitability of the Company depends on its ability to compete successfully with other financial services companies. We operate in a highly competitive financial services environment. Certain competitors are larger and may have more resources than we do. We face competition in our regional market areas from other commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, internet banks, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services. Some of the nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern the Company or The First and may have greater flexibility in competing for business.\nMany of these competitors also have broader geographic markets and substantially greater resources and lending limits than The First and offer certain services such as trust banking that The First does not currently provide. In addition, many of these competitors have numerous branch offices located throughout the extended market areas of The First that may provide these competitors with an advantage in geographic convenience that The First does not have at present. Currently there are numerous other commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions operating in The First\u2019s primary service area.\nWe also compete with numerous financial and quasi-financial institutions for deposits and loans, including providers of financial services over the internet. Recent technology advances and other changes have allowed parties to effectuate financial transactions that previously required the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and access to lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our competitors have reduced or eliminated certain service charges on deposit accounts, including overdraft fees, and additional competitors may be willing to reduce or eliminate service or other fees in order to attract additional customers. If the Company chooses to reduce or eliminate certain categories of fees, including those related to deposit accounts, fee income related to these products and services would be reduced. If the Company chooses not to take such actions, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in attracting customers for certain fee producing products.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that we can prevent any such failures, interruptions, cyber security breaches or other security breaches or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. We have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to various forms of external security breaches, which may include computer hacking, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, computer viruses or other malicious codes, phishing, employee error or malfeasance, catastrophes, unforeseen events or other cyber-attacks. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks or events. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or Company data could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with\nnew and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs.\nNatural disasters, public health emergencies, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could affect our ability to operate.\nOur market areas are susceptible to natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados. Natural disasters can disrupt operations, result in damage to properties that may be serving as collateral for our loan assets and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. Climate change may be increasing the nature, severity and frequency of adverse weather conditions, making the impact from these types of natural disasters on our customers or us worse. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage caused by future hurricanes, tornados or other natural disasters will affect operations or the economies in our market areas, but such weather events could cause a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties serving as collateral for our loans and an increase in the risk of delinquencies, foreclosures or loan losses.\nIn addition, health emergencies, disease pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, trade policies and sanctions, including the repercussions of the attack by Russia on Ukraine, and other external events could cause disruption in our operations. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is susceptible to fraud.\nOur business exposes us to fraud risk from our loan and deposit customers, the parties they do business with, as well as from our employees, contractors and vendors. We rely on financial and other data from new and existing customers which could turn out to be fraudulent when accepting such customers, executing their financial transactions and making and purchasing loans and other financial assets. In times of increased economic stress, we are at increased risk of fraud losses. We believe we have underwriting and operational controls in place to prevent or detect such fraud, but we cannot provide assurance that these controls will be effective in detecting fraud or that we will not experience fraud losses or incur costs or other damage related to such fraud, at levels that adversely affect our financial results or reputation. Our lending customers may also experience fraud in their businesses which could adversely affect their ability to repay their loans or make use of our services. Our exposure and the exposure of our customers to fraud may increase our financial risk and reputation risk as it may result in unexpected loan losses that exceed those that have been provided for in our allowance for loan losses.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled personnel.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for the best personnel in most activities we engage in can be intense, and we may not be able to hire personnel or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel with comparable skills, knowledge of our market, relationships in the communities we serve, and years of industry experience. Although we have employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, there is no guarantee that these officers and other key personnel will remain employed with the Company.\nThe failure of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and potential failures of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or concerns about, one or more financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could negatively impact market-wide liquidity and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions.\nThe novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has adversely affected our business, financial condition, results of operations and our liquidity, and the ultimate affect will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created extensive disruptions to the global economy and to the lives of individuals throughout the world, and will likely continue to have an impact for at least the near term. The pandemic and related efforts to contain it have disrupted global economic activity, adversely affected the functioning of financial markets, impacted interest rates, increased economic and market uncertainty, and disrupted trade, supply chains and the labor market. During the past two years, governments, businesses,\nand the public have taken unprecedented actions to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate its effects, including quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus packages, vaccine and mask mandates, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief. At present, most restrictions on movement have been lifted and widely available vaccines have proved to be effective in improving the economic outlook. As of December 31, 2021, economic conditions in our market area have returned close to pre-pandemic levels. Commercial activity has improved to levels close to those existing prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. While the overall outlook has improved based on the availability of the vaccine, the emergence of new variants of the virus have impeded the ability to fully resolve the pandemic and, as such, the risk of further economic disruptions and the possible reimplementation of business restrictions remains. Until the pandemic is fully controlled, the potential for adverse impact on our customers and the markets in which we operate and on our business, operations and financial condition is expected to remain elevated.\nFederal, state and local governments have mandated or encouraged financial services companies to make accommodations to borrowers and other customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Legal and regulatory responses to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic could result in additional regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our business in the future. In addition to the potential affects from negative economic conditions noted above, the Company instituted a program to help COVID-19 impacted customers. This program includes waiving NSF fees, offering payment deferment and other loan relief, as appropriate, for customers impacted by COVID-19. During the first half 2021, we originated $111.5 million of additional PPP loans under the second round of PPP loans. Furthermore, there has been litigation against banks related to their participation in the PPP and other government stimulus programs, the costs and effects of which could be material to us.\nCOVID-19 continues to present risks to our loan portfolio. Timely loan repayment and the value of collateral supporting the loans are affected by the strength of our borrower\u2019s business. Concern about the spread of COVID-19 has caused business shutdowns, limitations on commercial activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment and commercial property vacancy rates, reduced profitability and ability for property owners to make mortgage payments, and overall economic and financial market instability, all of which may cause our customers to be unable to make scheduled loan payments. If the effects of COVID-19 result in widespread and sustained repayment shortfalls on loans in our portfolio, we could incur significant delinquencies, foreclosures and credit losses, particularly if the available collateral is insufficient to cover our exposure. The future effects of COVID-19 on economic activity could negatively affect the collateral values associated with our existing loans, the ability to liquidate the real estate collateral securing our residential and commercial real estate loans, our ability to maintain loan origination volume and to obtain additional financing, the future demand for or profitability of our lending and services, and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers. Further, in the event of delinquencies, regulatory changes and policies designed to protect borrowers may slow or prevent us from making our business decisions or may result in a delay in our taking certain remediation and collection actions, such as foreclosure. Approximately 16% of our loan portfolio also includes exposure to sectors that have been and may continue to be subject to increased risk from the economic impact of COVID-19, including hotels, restaurants, retail, and direct energy.\nAs a result of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on our customers, we have faced and may continue to face a decrease in demand for certain products and disruptions in the operations of our customers\u2019 vendors. In addition, the Company will be required to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the carrying value of certain of its assets, including goodwill, and to conduct impairments tests on those assets, which may result in impairment charges on these assets in future periods that could be material.\nThe Federal Reserve lowered the primary credit rate by 50 and 100 basis points on March 3 and March 15, 2020, respectively, for a total of 150 basis points to a range of 0 percent to 0.25 percent to mitigate the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the liquidity and stability of banking institutions as they serve the increased demand for credit, which has continued into 2022. Prolonged duration of reduced interest rates could negatively impact our net interest income, margin and future profitability and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, increasing interest rates could negatively impact our cost of borrowing and reduce the amount of money our customers borrow or adversely affect their ability to repay outstanding loan balances that may increase due to adjustments in their variable rates. The continued economic impact of COVID-19 may also impair the ability of our borrowers to make their monthly loan payments, which would result in increases in delinquencies, declining collateral values, defaults, foreclosures and other losses on our loans as well as impact our operations and business. A protracted COVID-19 pandemic could further negatively affect the carrying amount of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets and result in realized losses on our financial assets. In addition, a decline in consumer confidence also could result in lower loan originations and decreases in deposits. It is not possible to predict the extent, severity or duration of these conditions or when normal economic and operating conditions will resume.\nAdditionally, COVID-19 could negatively affect our internal controls over financial reporting as many of our employees are required to work from home and therefore new processes, procedures, and controls could be required to respond to changes in our business environment. The increased reliance on remote access to information systems increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches as well as the information systems of our vendors or business partners. Further, should a significant number of our employees be required to quarantine, the attention of the management team could be diverted and our overall workforce could be significantly reduced.\nThe extent to which the pandemic impacts the Company\u2019s results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, government and regulatory responses to the pandemic, new information which may emerge concerning its severity and the actions necessary to contain it or address its impact, among others. Behavioral changes are not fully known and may not be temporary. See the section captioned \u201cCOVID-19 Impact\u201d in Part II. Financial Information, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations elsewhere in this report for further discussion.\nMerger-Related Risks\nWe may engage in acquisitions of other businesses from time to time, which may adversely impact our results.\nFrom time to time, we may engage in acquisitions of other businesses. Difficulty in integrating an acquired business or company may cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, or other anticipated benefits from any acquisition. The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition (run-off), loss of key employees, disruption of the Company\u2019s business or the business of the acquired company, or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. The acquired companies may also have legal contingencies, beyond those that we are aware of, that could result in unexpected costs. The Company may need to make additional investment in equipment and personnel to manage higher asset levels and loan balances as a result of any significant acquisition, which may adversely impact earnings.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other financial benefits of recent acquisitions in the timeframe we expect, or at all.\nThe Company completed the Southwest Georgia Financial Corporation (\u201cSWG\u201d) acquisition on April 2, 2020 and the acquisition of the Cadence Branches on December 3, 2021. Achieving the anticipated cost savings and financial benefits of the mergers will depend, in part, on whether we can successfully integrate these businesses with and into the business of The First. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors, and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the mergers. In addition, the integration of certain operations following the mergers has required and will continue to require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day business of the combined company. Any inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated cost savings and financial benefits of the mergers, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company.\nWe have incurred and may continue to incur significant transaction and merger-related costs in connection with our recent acquisitions.\nWe have incurred and may continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with our recent acquisitions. These costs and expenses include fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, severance, retention bonus and other potential employment-related costs, filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges. There are also a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the integration of these companies\u2019 businesses. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred in connection with the acquisitions, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses.\nThere may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the acquisitions that we may not recoup. These costs and expenses could reduce the realization of efficiencies, strategic benefits and additional income we expect to achieve from the\nacquisitions. Although we expect that these benefits will offset the transaction expenses and implementation costs over time, the net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nWe may incur impairment to goodwill.\nWe review our goodwill at least annually. Significant negative industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows or disruptions to our business, could indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgements and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely on projections of future operating performance. We operate in a competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. In addition, if our analysis results is an impairment to our goodwill, we would be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which such impairment is determined to exist. Any such charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for investors to resell shares of common stock at a time or price they find attractive.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to those described in \u201cSpecial Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d these factors include, among others:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results, financial condition or asset quality;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates or the publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to us or other financial institutions;\n\u25cf failure to declare dividends on our common stock from time to time;\n\u25cf failure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u25cf failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u25cf strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, dispositions or financings;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors or other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u25cf proposed or final regulatory changes or developments;\n\u25cf anticipated or pending regulatory investigations, proceedings, or litigation that may involve or affect us;\n\u25cf reports in the press or investment community generally relating to our reputation or the financial services industry;\n\u25cf domestic and international economic and political factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u25cf general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u25cf adverse weather conditions, including floods, tornadoes and hurricanes;\n\u25cf public health emergencies, including disease pandemics; and\n\u25cf disruptions to the financial markets as a result of the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including escalating military tension between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our stock price, notwithstanding our operating results. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate and there can be no assurances about the levels of the market prices for our common stock.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nWe may need to rely on the financial markets to provide needed capital.\nOur common stock is listed and traded on the Nasdaq stock market. Although we anticipate that our capital resources will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet our capital requirements, at times we may depend on the liquidity of the capital markets to raise additional capital. Our historical ability to raise capital through the sale of capital stock and debt securities may be affected by economic and market conditions or regulatory changes that are beyond our control. Adverse changes in our operating performance or financial condition could make raising additional capital difficult or more expensive or limit our access to customary sources of funding. If the market should fail to operate, or if conditions in the capital markets are adverse, our efforts to raise capital could require the issuance of securities at times and with maturities, conditions and rates that are disadvantageous, and which could have a dilutive impact on our current stockholders. Should these risks materialize, the ability to further expand our operations through organic or acquisitive growth may be limited.\nSecurities issued by the Company, including the Company\u2019s common stock, are not FDIC insured.\nSecurities issued by the Company, including the Company\u2019s common stock, are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of any bank and are not insured by the FDIC, the Deposit Insurance Fund, or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, or any private insurer, and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.\nAnti-takeover laws and certain agreements and charter provisions may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of state and federal law and our articles of incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of the Company. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity, or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, including the Company\u2019s shares. Banking agencies review the acquisition to determine if it will result in a change of control. The banking agencies have 60 days to act on the notice, and take into account several factors, including the resources of the acquiror and the antitrust effects of the acquisition. There also are Mississippi statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. As a result, these statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation could result in the Company being less attractive to a potential acquiror.\nThe trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Market, the trading volume for our common stock is low relative to other larger financial services companies, and you are not assured liquidity with respect to transactions in our common stock. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock price to fall.\nYou may not receive dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we have historically declared quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or cease to pay common stock dividends in the future. If we reduce or cease to pay common stock dividends, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe principal source of funds from which we pay cash dividends are the dividends received from The First. Federal and state banking laws and regulations and state corporate laws restrict the amount of dividends we may declare and pay from The First. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation and Supervision\u201d included herein for more information.\nIf we fail to pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be the sole opportunity for gains on an investment in our common stock. In addition, in the event The First becomes unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service our debt or pay our other obligations or pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock. Accordingly, our inability to receive dividends from The First could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of your investment in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91274, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FBMS"}
