{"cik": "1766400", "company": "Pennant Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all other information set forth in this information statement. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks relating to our business and industry, risks relating to the Spin-Off and risks relating to our common stock. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our company in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should carefully read the following risk factors, together with the financial statements, related notes and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that contain risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the section entitled \"\u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\"\u201d on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in connection with your consideration of the risk factors and other important factors that may affect future results described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur revenue could be impacted by federal changes to reimbursement and other aspects of Medicare.\nWe derived 41.9%, 40.5% and 39.0% of our revenue from the Medicare program for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, many other payors may use published Medicare rates as a basis for reimbursements. Accordingly, if Medicare reimbursement rates are reduced or fail to increase as quickly as our costs, or if there are changes in the way these programs pay for services, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe Medicare program and its reimbursement rates and rules are subject to frequent change. These include statutory and regulatory changes affecting base rates or basis of payment, retroactive rate adjustments, annual caps that limit the amount that can be paid (including deductible and coinsurance amounts), administrative or executive orders and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially adversely affect the rates at which Medicare reimburses us for our services. Budget pressures often lead the federal government to reduce or place limits on reimbursement rates under Medicare. Implementation of these and other types of measure has in the past and could in the future result in substantial reductions in our revenue and operating margins. For example, due to the federal sequestration, an automatic 2% reduction in Medicare spending took effect beginning April 2013. Subsequent actions by Congress extended sequestration through 2023.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Item 1., Government Regulation, Medicare home health reimbursement is undergoing a significant change with the implementation of PDGM. While CMS is attempting to implement PDGM in a budget neutral manner, this neutrality assumes that providers will make certain coding and behavioral changes. Therefore, the rule\u2019s ultimate impact will vary by provider based on factors including patient mix, admission source, and providers\u2019 ability to adapt to the new reimbursement model. For our home health segment, the finalization of these assumptions could negatively impact our future rate of reimbursement and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, Medicare payments can be delayed or declined due to determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable because either adequate or additional documentation was not provided or because certain services were not covered or considered medically necessary. Additionally, revenue from these payors can be retroactively adjusted after a new examination during the claims settlement process or as a result of post-payment audits. New legislation and regulatory proposals could impose further limitations on government payments to healthcare providers.\nIn addition, CMS often changes the rules governing the Medicare program, including those governing reimbursement. Changes to the Medicare program that could adversely affect our business include:\n\u2022administrative or legislative changes to base rates or the bases of payment;\n\u2022limits on the services or types of providers for which Medicare will provide reimbursement;\n\u2022changes in methodology for patient assessment and/or determination of payment levels;\n\u2022the reduction or elimination of annual rate increases (See also, Item 1., Government Regulation); or\n\u2022an increase in co-payments or deductibles payable by beneficiaries.\nAmong the important statutory changes that are being implemented by CMS are provisions of the IMPACT Act. This law imposes a stringent timeline for implementing benchmark quality measures and data metrics across post-acute care providers (including home health agencies). The enactment also mandates specific actions to design a unified payment methodology for post-acute providers. CMS continues to promulgate regulations to implement provisions of this enactment. Depending on the final details, the costs of implementation could be significant. The failure to meet implementation requirements could expose providers to fines and payment reductions.\nReductions in reimbursement rates or the scope of services being reimbursed could have a material, adverse effect on our revenue, financial condition and results of operations or even result in reimbursement rates that are insufficient to cover our operating costs. Additionally, any delay or default by the government in making Medicare reimbursement payments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReductions in Medicaid reimbursement rates or changes in the rules governing the Medicaid program could have a material, adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derived 13.7%, 12.6% and 12.4% of our revenue from Medicaid programs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Medicaid is a state-administered program financed by both state funds and matching federal funds. Medicaid spending has increased rapidly in recent years, becoming a significant component of state budgets. This has led the federal government and many states to institute measures aimed at controlling the growth of Medicaid spending, and in some instances, reducing aggregate Medicaid spending. Any budget reductions or delays in these states in which we operate could adversely affect our net patient service revenue and profitability. Despite present state budget surpluses in many of the states in which we operate, we can expect continuing cost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for our services, and any such decline could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Medicaid program and its reimbursement rates and rules are subject to frequent change at both the federal and state level. These include statutory and regulatory changes, rate adjustments (including retroactive adjustments), administrative or executive orders and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially adversely affect the rates at which our services are reimbursed by state Medicaid plans. To generate funds to pay for the increasing costs of the Medicaid program, many states utilize financial arrangements commonly referred to as provider taxes. Under provider tax arrangements, states collect taxes from healthcare providers and then use the revenue to pay the providers as a Medicaid expenditure, which allows the states to then claim additional federal matching funds on the additional reimbursements. Current federal law provides for a cap on the maximum allowable provider tax as a percentage of the provider\u2019s total revenue. There can be no assurance that federal law will continue to provide matching federal funds on state Medicaid expenditures funded through provider taxes, or that the current caps on provider taxes will not be reduced. Any discontinuance or reduction in federal matching of provider tax-related Medicaid expenditures could have a significant and adverse effect on states\u2019 Medicaid expenditures, and as a result could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nReforms to the U.S. healthcare system continue to impose new requirements upon us and may lower our reimbursements.\nThe ACA included sweeping changes to how healthcare is paid for and furnished in the United States. Applicable to our business, as discussed in greater detail in Item 1., Government Regulation, the ACA included the following:\n\u2022Sought to address potential fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs by, among other things, (1) implementing screenings and enhanced oversight periods for new providers and suppliers, (2) providing enhanced penalties for submitting false claims, (3) providing funding for enhanced anti-fraud activities, and (4) providing the federal government with expanded authority to suspend payment if a provider is investigated for allegations or issues of fraud.\n\u2022Gave authority to HHS to establish, test and evaluate alternative payment methodologies for Medicare services, many of which have been developed, focusing on incentives for providers to coordinate patient care across the continuum and to be jointly accountable for an entire episode of care centered around a hospitalization.\n\u2022Working to improve the healthcare delivery system through incentives to enhance quality, improve beneficiary outcomes and increase value of care, with one of these key delivery system reforms being the encouragement of Accountable Care Organizations (\u201cACOs\u201d) to facilitate coordination and cooperation among providers to improve the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries and reduce unnecessary costs. Participating ACOs that meet specified quality performance standards are eligible to receive a share of any savings if the actual per capita expenditures of their assigned Medicare beneficiaries are a sufficient percentage below their specified benchmark amount.\n\u2022Required HHS to develop a plan to implement a value-based purchasing program for Medicare payments to home health agencies, including measures and performance standards regarding preventable hospital readmissions. As part of this mandate, on January 1, 2016 CMS implemented HH VBP, which rewards home health agencies with incentive payments based on the quality of care they provide to Medicare beneficiaries.\nCMS will continue to issue rules to implement the ACA. Courts will continue to interpret and apply the ACA\u2019s provisions. We cannot predict what effect these changes will have on our business, including the demand for our services or the amount of reimbursement available for those services. However, it is possible these new laws may lower reimbursement or increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, as discussed below under the heading \u201cOur business may be materially impacted if certain aspects of the ACA are amended, repealed, or successfully challenged,\u201d any further amendments or revisions to the ACA or its implementing regulations could materially impact our business. Moreover, the upcoming presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation, implementation or repeal of laws and rules related to government health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. This includes Democratic\nproposals for Medicare for All or significant expansion of Medicare, which could significantly impact our business and the healthcare industry. We continually monitor these developments in order to respond to the changing regulatory environment impacting our business.\nOur business may be materially impacted if certain aspects of the ACA are amended, repealed, or successfully challenged.\nA number of lawsuits have been filed challenging various aspects of the ACA and related regulations. In addition, the efficacy of the ACA is the subject of much debate among members of Congress and the public. On December 14, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas held the individual mandate provision, and therefore the entirety of the ACA, unconstitutional. This ruling was appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which issued its decision on December 18, 2019, partially affirming the district court\u2019s decision, finding the individual mandate to be unconstitutional and remanding the case to the district court for additional analysis on whether the individual mandate provision was severable from the remainder of the ACA. The case has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Other unrelated cases challenging the ACA or related rules have had inconsistent outcomes-some expand the ACA while others limit the ACA. Thus, the future impact of the ACA on our business is difficult to predict. The uncertainty as to the future of the ACA may negatively impact our business, as will any material changes to the ACA.\nPresidential and Congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes to, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation, implementation or repeal of the ACA, and other federal health program policy that could significantly impact our business and the healthcare industry. In the event that legal challenges are successful, or the ACA is repealed or materially amended, particularly any elements of the ACA that are beneficial to our business or that cause changes in the health insurance industry, including reimbursement and coverage by private, Medicare or Medicaid payers, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, specific proposals discussed during and after the election, including a repeal or material amendment of the ACA, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, even if the ACA is not amended or repealed, the President and the executive branch of the federal government, as well as CMS and HHS have a significant impact on the implementation of the provisions of the ACA, and a new administration could make changes impacting the implementation and enforcement of the ACA, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we are slow or unable to adapt to any such changes, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to various government reviews, audits and investigations that could adversely affect our business, including an obligation to refund amounts previously paid to us, potential criminal charges, the imposition of fines, and/or the loss of our right to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Item 1., Government Regulation, as a result of our participation in the Medicaid and Medicare programs, we are subject to various governmental reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. We are subject to regulatory reviews relating to Medicare services, billings and potential overpayments resulting from the Recovery Audit Contractors, Zone Program Integrity Contractors, Program Safeguard Contractors, Unified Program Integrity Contractors, Supplemental Medical Review Contractors and Medicaid Integrity Contributors programs, in which third party firms engaged by CMS conduct extensive reviews of claims data and medical and other records to identify potential improper payments under the Medicare programs. Private pay sources also reserve the right to conduct audits. We believe that billing and reimbursement errors and disagreements are common in our industry. We are regularly engaged in reviews, audits and appeals of our claims for reimbursement due to the subjectivities inherent in the process related to patient diagnosis and care, record keeping, claims processing and other aspects of the patient service and reimbursement processes, and the errors and disagreements those subjectivities can produce. An adverse review, audit or investigation could result in:\n\u2022an obligation to refund amounts previously paid to us pursuant to the Medicare or Medicaid programs or from private payors, in amounts that could be material to our business;\n\u2022state or federal agencies imposing fines, penalties and other sanctions on us;\n\u2022loss of our right to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid programs or one or more private payor networks;\n\u2022an increase in private litigation against us; and\n\u2022damage to our reputation in various markets.\nAll findings of overpayment from CMS contractors are eligible for appeal through the CMS defined continuum. With the exception of rare findings of overpayment related to objective errors in Medicare payment methodology or claims\nprocessing, we utilize all defenses reasonably available to us to demonstrate that the services provided meet all clinical and regulatory requirements for reimbursement.\nIn cases where claim and documentation review by any CMS contractor results in repeated poor performance, an operation can be subjected to protracted oversight. This oversight may include repeat education and re-probe, extended pre-payment review, referral to recovery audit or integrity contractors, or extrapolation of an error rate to other reimbursement outside of specifically reviewed claims. Sustained failure to demonstrate improvement towards meeting all claim filing and documentation requirements could ultimately lead to Medicare decertification.\nAdditionally, both federal and state government agencies have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies. The focus of these investigations includes, among other things:\n\u2022cost reporting and billing practices;\n\u2022quality of care;\n\u2022financial relationships with referral sources; and\n\u2022medical necessity of services provided.\nIf any of our affiliated operations are decertified or loses its licenses, our revenue, financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, the report of such issues at any of our affiliated operations could harm our reputation for quality care and lead to a reduction in the patient referrals of our independent operating subsidiaries and ultimately a reduction in census at these operations. Also, responding to auditing and enforcement efforts diverts material time, resources and attention from our management team and our staff, and could have a materially detrimental impact on our results of operations during and after any such investigation or proceedings, regardless of whether we prevail on the underlying claim.\nIf the government or court were to conclude that such errors and deficiencies constituted criminal violations, or were to conclude that such errors and deficiencies resulted in the submission of false claims to federal healthcare programs, or if it were to discover other problems in addition to the ones identified by the probe reviews that rose to actionable levels, we and certain of our officers might face potential criminal charges and/or civil claims, administrative sanctions and penalties for amounts that could be material to our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we and/or some of the key personnel of our independent operating subsidiaries could be temporarily or permanently excluded from future participation in state and federal healthcare reimbursement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. In any event, it is likely that a governmental investigation alone, regardless of its outcome, would divert material time, resources and attention from our leaders and employees, and could have a materially detrimental impact on our results of operations during and after any such investigation or proceedings.\nWe are subject to extensive and complex federal and state government laws and regulations. If we are not operating in compliance with these laws and regulations or if these laws and regulations change, we could be required to make significant expenditures or change our operations in order to bring our operations into compliance.\nWe, along with other companies in the healthcare industry, are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:\n\u2022operation and professional licensure, certificates of need, permits and other government approvals;\n\u2022adequacy and quality of healthcare services;\n\u2022qualifications of healthcare and support personnel;\n\u2022quality of medical equipment;\n\u2022confidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with medical records and claims processing;\n\u2022relationships with physicians and other referral sources and recipients;\n\u2022constraints on protective contractual provisions with patients and third-party payors;\n\u2022operating policies and procedures;\n\u2022certification of additional providers by the Medicare or Medicaid program; and\n\u2022payment for services.\nThe laws and regulations governing our operations, along with the terms of participation in various government programs, regulate how we do business, the services we offer, and our interactions with patients and other healthcare providers. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent change. We believe that such regulations may increase in the future and we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or impact on us of any healthcare reform legislation. Changes in existing laws or regulations, or the enactment of new laws or regulations, could negatively impact our business. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties and other detrimental consequences, including denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, temporary suspension of admission of new patients, suspension or decertification from the Medicaid and Medicare programs, restrictions on our ability to acquire new operations or expand or operate existing operations, the loss of our licenses to operate and the loss of our ability to participate in federal and state reimbursement programs. Additionally, in the future, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our operations, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Item 1., Government Regulation, we are subject to federal and state laws, such as the FCA, state false claims acts, the illegal remuneration provisions of the Social Security Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute, state anti-kickback laws, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law and federal Stark law. Among other things, these laws prohibit kickbacks, bribes and rebates, as well as other direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements that are designed to induce the referral of patients to a particular provider for medical products or services payable by any federal healthcare program, and prohibit presenting a false or misleading claim for payment under a federal or state program. They also prohibit some physician self-referrals. Possible sanctions for violation of any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of eligibility to participate in federal and state reimbursement programs and civil and criminal penalties. Changes in these laws could increase our cost of doing business. If we fail to comply, even inadvertently, with any of these requirements, we could be required to alter our operations, refund payments to the government, enter into a corporate integrity agreement, deferred prosecution or similar agreements with state or federal government agencies, and become subject to significant civil and criminal penalties.\nThese anti-fraud and abuse laws and regulations are complex, and we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. While we do not believe we are in violation of these prohibitions, we cannot assure you that governmental officials charged with the responsibility for enforcing these prohibitions will not assert that we are violating the provisions of such laws and regulations.\nWe are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local regulation or legislation, including Medicare and Medicaid statutes and regulations related to fraud and abuse, the intensity of federal and state enforcement actions or the extent and size of any potential sanctions, fines or penalties. Changes in the regulatory framework, our failure to obtain or renew required regulatory approvals or licenses or to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our disqualification from participation in federal and state reimbursement programs, or the imposition of other enforcement sanctions, fines or penalties could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, should we lose licenses or certifications for a number of our operations as a result of regulatory action or legal proceedings, we could be deemed to be in default under some of our agreements, including agreements governing outstanding indebtedness.\nPublic and government calls for increased survey and enforcement efforts toward the home health, hospice and senior living industries could result in increased scrutiny by state and federal survey agencies. In addition, potential sanctions and remedies based upon alleged regulatory deficiencies could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe intensified and evolving enforcement environment impacts providers like us because of the increase in the scope or number of inspections or surveys by governmental authorities and the severity of consequent citations for alleged failure to comply with regulatory requirements. We also divert personnel resources to respond to federal and state investigations, audits and other enforcement actions. The diversion of these resources, including our management team, clinical and compliance staff, and others, takes away from the time and energy that these individuals could otherwise spend on routine operations.\nAs discussed in Item 1., Government Regulation, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive deficiency reports from state and federal regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections or surveys. The focus of these deficiency reports tends to vary from year to year and state to state. Although most inspection deficiencies are resolved through an agreed-upon plan of corrective action, the reviewing agency typically has the authority to take further action against a licensed or certified operation, which could result in the imposition of fines, imposition of a provisional or conditional license, suspension or revocation of a license, suspension of new admission or bed holds, loss of certification as a provider under state or federal healthcare programs, or imposition of other sanctions, including criminal penalties.\nFurthermore, in some states, citations in one operation can impact other operations in the state. Revocation of a license or decertification at a given operation could therefore impair our ability to obtain new licenses or to renew existing licenses at other operations, which may also trigger defaults or cross-defaults under our leases and our credit arrangements, or adversely affect our ability to operate or obtain financing in the future. If state or federal regulators were to determine, formally or otherwise, that one operation\u2019s regulatory history ought to impact another of our existing or prospective communities, this could also increase costs, result in increased scrutiny by state and federal survey agencies, and even impact our expansion plans. Therefore, our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in any single operation could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations as a whole.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may opt to voluntarily stop accepting new patients pending completion of a new state survey, in order to avoid straining staff and other resources while retraining staff, upgrading operating systems or making other operational improvements. If we elect to voluntarily close any operations in the future or opt to stop accepting new patients pending completion of a state or federal survey, it could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operation. We did not incur material losses of revenue related to denial of payment status due to findings of continued regulatory deficiencies in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nFuture cost containment initiatives undertaken by payors may limit our future revenue and profitability.\nOur Managed Care revenue and profitability may be affected by continuing efforts of third-party payors to maintain or reduce costs of healthcare by lowering payment rates, narrowing the scope of covered services and network providers, increasing case management review of services and negotiating pricing. In addition, sustained unfavorable economic conditions may affect the number of patients enrolled in managed care programs and the profitability of managed care companies, which could result in reduced revenue. There can be no assurance that third-party payors will make timely payments for our services, or that we will continue to maintain our current payor or revenue mix. We are continuing our efforts to develop our Ma sources of revenue and any changes in payment levels from current or future third-party payors could have a material adverse effect on our business and combined financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased competition for, or a shortage of, nurses and other skilled personnel could increase our staffing and labor costs and subject us to monetary fines.\nOur success depends upon our ability to retain and attract nurses, certified nurse assistants, social workers and speech, physical and occupational therapists. Our success also depends upon our ability to retain and attract skilled personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of each of our affiliated operations. Each operation has a leader responsible for the overall day-to-day operations of the business, including quality of care, social services and financial performance. Depending upon the size of the operation, each leader is supported by staff that is directly responsible for day-to-day care of the patients, marketing and community outreach programs. We compete with various healthcare service providers in retaining and attracting qualified and skilled personnel.\nIncreased competition for, or a shortage of, nurses or other trained personnel, or general inflationary pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel. We may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates we charge to the patients of our business. Turnover rates and the magnitude of the shortage of nurses or other trained personnel vary substantially from operation to operation. An increase in costs associated with, or a shortage of, skilled nurses, could negatively impact our independent operating subsidiaries. In addition, if we fail to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel, our independent operating subsidiaries\u2019 ability to conduct their business operations effectively could be harmed.\nWe depend on our management team and local leaders, and the loss of their services could harm our business.\nWe believe that our success depends in part on the continued services of our executive management and local leadership teams. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and could adversely affect our strategic relationships and impede our ability to execute our business strategies. The market for qualified individuals may be highly competitive and finding and recruiting suitable replacements for our leaders may be difficult, time consuming and costly.\nOur hospice independent operating subsidiaries are subject to annual Medicare caps calculated by Medicare. If such caps were to be exceeded by any of our hospice providers, our business and combined financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWith respect to our hospice independent operating subsidiaries, overall payments made by Medicare to each provider number are subject to caps calculated by Medicare, as discussed in greater detail in Item 1, Government Regulation. If payments received by any one of our hospice provider numbers exceeds either of these caps, we are required to reimburse Medicare for payments received in excess of the caps, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated and combined financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSecurity breaches and other cyber-security incidents could violate security laws and subject us to significant liability.\nOur business is dependent on the proper functioning and availability of our computer systems and networks. While we have taken steps to protect the safety and security of our information systems and the patient health information and other data maintained within those systems, we cannot assure you that our safety and security measures and disaster recovery plan will prevent damage, interruption, or breach of our information systems and operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of our information systems. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or operations, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud or other forms of deceiving our employees or contractors.\nOn occasion, we have acquired additional information systems through our business acquisitions. We have upgraded and expanded our information system capabilities and have committed significant resources to maintain, protect, enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences.\nWe license certain third-party software to support our operations and information systems. Our inability, or the inability of third-party software providers, to continue to maintain and upgrade our information systems and software could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems also could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.\nA cyber-security attack or other incident that bypasses our information systems security could cause a security breach which may lead to a material disruption to our information systems infrastructure or business and may involve a significant loss of business or otherwise compromise patient health information. If a cyber-security attack or other unauthorized attempt to access our systems or operations were to be successful, it could result in the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential information or intellectual property, and could cause operational or business delays that may materially impact our ability to provide various healthcare services. Any successful cyber-security attack or other unauthorized attempt to access our systems or operations also could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation or brand with our patients, referral sources, payors or other third parties and could subject us to substantial penalties under HIPAA and other federal and state privacy laws, including, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect January 2020 and includes a private right of action that may expose us to private litigation regarding our privacy practices and significant damages awards or settlements in civil litigation.\nFailure to maintain the security and functionality of our information systems and related software, or a failure to defend a cyber-security attack or other attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems, operations or patient health information could expose us to a number of adverse consequences, the vast majority of which are not insurable, including but not limited to disruptions in our operations, regulatory and other civil and criminal penalties, fines, investigations and enforcement actions (including, but not limited to, those arising from the SEC, Federal Trade Commission, the OIG or state attorneys general), fines, private litigation with those affected by the data breach, loss of customers, disputes with payors and increased operating expense, which either individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe OIG or other regulatory authorities may choose to more closely scrutinize billing practices in areas where we operate or propose to expand, which could result in an increase in regulatory monitoring and oversight, decreased reimbursement rates, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEfforts by officials and others to make or advocate for any increase in regulatory monitoring and oversight, reduce payment rates, revise methodologies for assessing and treating patients, conduct more frequent or intense reviews of our treatment and billing practices, or implement moratoria in areas where we operate or propose to expand, could reduce our reimbursement, increase our costs of doing business and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn July 2019, the OIG released a report entitled \u201cHospice Deficiencies Pose Risks to Medicare Beneficiaries.\u201d The report reviewed the results of hospice surveys conducted from 2012 to 2016 and found that 87% of hospices had a deficiency during that period. Twenty percent had a serious (condition-level) deficiency. One third of hospices had complaints filed against them and half of those were severe. Previous reports have identified that improper billing by hospices costs Medicare hundreds of millions of dollars each year, including billing for ineligible patients, improper levels of care, duplicative services, and other forms of fraud.\nCMS remains committed to implementing a plan for oversight of home health agencies through Supplemental Medical Review Contractor audits of every home health agency in the country. In addition, in many of its recent Work Plans, the OIG indicated that it will review compliance with various aspects which impact reimbursement to home health or hospice providers, including the documentation in support of the claims paid by Medicare.\nState efforts to regulate or deregulate the healthcare services industry or the construction or expansion of the number of home health, hospice or senior living operations could impair our ability to expand or result in increased competition.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Item 1., Government Regulation, our ability to acquire or establish new home health, hospice or senior living operations or expand or provide new services at existing operations would be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain required the necessary approvals, if there are changes in the standards applicable to those approvals, or if we experience delays and increased expenses associated with obtaining those approvals. We may not be able to obtain licensure, CON approval, Medicare or Medicaid certification, Attorney General approval or other necessary approvals for future expansion projects.\nConversely, and specific to the highly competitive industry of senior living, the elimination or reduction of state regulations that limit the construction, expansion or renovation of new or existing communities could result in increased competition to us. In general, regulatory and other barriers to entry into the senior living industry are not prohibitive. Over the last several years, there has been a significant increase in the construction of new senior living communities, including in many of the states where we provide services. This new construction has resulted in increased competition in many of our markets. Such new competition may limit our ability to attract new residents, raise rents or otherwise expand our senior living business, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nChanges in federal and state employment-related laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business.\nOur independent operating subsidiaries are subject to a variety of federal and state employment-related laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, the Americans with Disabilities Act (the \u201cADA\u201d) and similar state laws that provide civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas, the National Labor Relations Act, regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, regulations of the Office of Civil Rights, regulations of state Attorneys General, family leave mandates and a variety of similar laws enacted by the federal and state governments that govern these and other employment law matters. Because labor represents such a large portion of our operating costs, changes in federal and state employment-related laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business.\nThe compliance costs associated with these laws and evolving regulations could be substantial. For example, all of our affiliated operations are required to comply with the ADA. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d and \u201ccommercial properties,\u201d but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of government fines or an award of damages to private litigants. Further legislation may impose additional burdens or restrictions with respect to access by disabled persons. In addition, federal proposals to introduce a system of mandated health insurance and flexible work time and other similar initiatives could, if implemented, adversely affect our operations. We\nalso may be subject to employee-related claims such as wrongful discharge, discrimination or violation of equal employment law. While we are insured for these types of claims, we could experience damages that are not covered by our insurance policies or that exceed our insurance limits, and we may be required to pay such damages directly, which would negatively impact our cash flow from operations.\nRequired regulatory approvals could delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare operations, which could result in periods in which we are unable to receive reimbursement for such properties.\nThe operations of our independent operating subsidiaries must be licensed under applicable state law and, depending upon the type of operation, certified or approved as providers under the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. In the process of acquiring or transferring operating assets, our operations must receive change of ownership approvals from state licensing agencies, Medicare and Medicaid, and third party payors. If there are any delays in receiving regulatory approvals from the applicable federal, state or local government agencies, or the inability to receive such approvals, such delays could result in delayed or lost reimbursement related to periods of service prior to the receipt of such approvals.\nCompliance with federal and state fair housing, fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make unanticipated expenditures, which could be costly to us.\nWe must comply with the federal Fair Housing Act and similar state laws, which prohibit us from discriminating against individuals if it would cause such individuals to face barriers in gaining residency in any of our affiliated communities. Additionally, the Fair Housing Act and other similar state laws require that we advertise our services in such a way that we promote, and not limit, diversity. We may be required, among other things, to change our marketing techniques to comply with these requirements.\nIn addition, we are required to operate our affiliated communities in compliance with applicable fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations and food licensing or certification requirements as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies from time to time. Surveys occur on a regular (often annual or biannual) schedule, and special surveys may result from a specific complaint filed by a patient, a family member or one of our competitors. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with these requirements.\nWe depend largely upon reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors, and our revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted by any changes in the acuity mix of patients in our affiliated operations as well as payor mix and payment methodologies.\nOur revenue is determined in part by the acuity of home health and hospice patients and senior living residents. Changes in the acuity level of patients we attract, as well as our payor mix among Medicare, Medicaid, managed care organizations and private payors, significantly affect our profitability because we generally receive higher reimbursement rates for high acuity patients and because the payors reimburse us at different rates. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 55.6%, 53.1%, and 51.4%, respectively, of our revenue was provided by government payors that reimburse us at predetermined rates. If our labor or other operating costs increase, we will be unable to recover such increased costs from government payors. Accordingly, if we fail to maintain our proportion of high acuity patients or if there is any significant increase in the percentage of the patients of our independent operating subsidiaries for whom we receive Medicaid reimbursement, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nInitiatives undertaken by major insurers and managed care companies to contain healthcare costs may adversely affect our business. Among other initiatives, these payors attempt to control healthcare costs by contracting with healthcare providers to obtain services on a discounted basis. We believe that this trend will continue and may limit reimbursements for healthcare services. If insurers or managed care companies from whom we receive substantial payments were to reduce the amounts they pay for services, we may lose patients if we choose not to renew our contracts with these insurers at lower rates.\nCompliance with state and federal employment, immigration, licensing and other laws could increase our cost of doing business.\nOur independent operating subsidiaries have hired personnel, including nurses and therapists, from outside the United States. If immigration laws are changed, or if new and more restrictive government regulations proposed by the Department of Homeland Security are enacted, our access to qualified and skilled personnel may be limited.\nOur subsidiaries operate in at least one state that requires them to verify employment eligibility using procedures and standards that exceed those required under federal Form I-9 and the statutes and regulations related thereto. Proposed federal\nregulations would extend similar requirements to all of the states in which our affiliated operations operate. To the extent that such proposed regulations or similar measures become effective, and our subsidiaries are required by state or federal authorities to verify work authorization or legal residence for current and prospective employees beyond existing Form I-9 requirements and other statutes and regulations currently in effect, it may make it more difficult for our subsidiaries to recruit, hire and/or retain qualified employees, may increase our risk of non-compliance with state and federal employment, immigration, licensing and other laws and regulations and could increase our cost of doing business.\nWe are subject to litigation that could result in significant legal costs and large settlement amounts or damage awards.\nOur business involves a significant risk of liability given the age and health of the patients and residents of our independent operating subsidiaries and the services we provide. The healthcare industry has experienced an increased trend in the number and severity of litigation claims, due in part to the number of large verdicts, including large punitive damage awards. These claims are filed based upon a wide variety of claims and theories, including deficiencies under conditions of participation under certain state and federal healthcare programs. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys have become increasingly more aggressive in their pursuit of claims against healthcare providers, including home health, hospice and senior living providers, employing a wide variety of advertising and solicitation activities to generate more claims. The defense of lawsuits has in the past, and may in the future, result in significant legal costs, regardless of the outcome. Additionally, increases to the frequency and/or severity of losses from such claims and suits may result in increased liability insurance premiums and/or a decline in available insurance coverage levels, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealthcare litigation (including professional liability and class action litigation) is common and is filed based upon a wide variety of claims and theories, and we are routinely subjected to varying types of claims. Future claims could be brought that may materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other claims and suits, including class actions, could be filed against us and other companies in our industry. For example, there has been an increase in the number of wage and hour class action claims filed in several of the jurisdictions where we are present. Allegations typically include claimed failures to permit or properly compensate for meal and rest periods, or failure to pay for time worked. If there were a significant increase in the number of these claims or an increase in amounts owing should plaintiffs be successful in their prosecution of these claims, this could have a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we contract with a variety of landlords, lenders, vendors, suppliers, consultants and other individuals and businesses. These contracts typically contain covenants and default provisions. If the other party to one or more of our contracts were to allege that we have violated the contract terms, we could be subject to civil liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWere litigation to be instituted against one or more of our subsidiaries, a successful plaintiff might attempt to hold us or another subsidiary liable for the alleged wrongdoing of the subsidiary principally targeted by the litigation. If a court in such litigation decided to disregard the corporate form, the resulting judgment could increase our liability and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct regular internal investigations into the care delivery, recordkeeping and billing processes of our independent operating subsidiaries. These reviews sometimes detect instances of noncompliance which we attempt to correct, which can decrease our revenue.\nAs discussed under Item 1., Monitoring Compliance in our Operations, we have internal compliance policies and procedures, including ongoing monitoring and controls. From time to time, our systems and controls highlight potential compliance issues, which we investigate as they arise. Historically, we have, and would continue to do so in the future, initiated internal inquiries into possible recordkeeping and related irregularities. Through these internal inquiries, we have identified potential deficiencies in the assessment of and recordkeeping for small subsets of patients. We have also identified and, at the conclusion of such investigations, assisted in implementing, targeted improvements in the assessment and recordkeeping practices to make them consistent with the existing standards and policies. We continue to monitor the measures implemented for effectiveness and perform follow-up reviews to ensure compliance. Consistent with healthcare industry accounting practices, we record any charge for refunded payments against revenue in the period in which the claim adjustment becomes known.\nIf additional reviews result in identification and quantification of additional amounts to be refunded, we will accrue additional liabilities for claim costs and interest and repay any amounts due in normal course. Furthermore, failure to refund overpayments within required time frames (as described in greater detail under Item 1., Government Regulation) could result in FCA liability. If future investigations ultimately result in findings of significant billing and reimbursement noncompliance\nwhich could require us to record significant additional provisions or remit payments, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and our stock price could decline.\nWe may be unable to complete future acquisitions at attractive prices or at all, which may adversely affect our revenue growth; we may also elect to dispose of underperforming or non-strategic independent operating subsidiaries, which would decrease our revenue.\nTo date, our revenue growth has been significantly accelerated by our acquisition of new operations. Subject to general market conditions and the availability of essential resources and leadership within our company, we continue to seek home health, hospice and senior living acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our geographic, financial and operating objectives.\nWe face competition for the acquisition of operations and businesses and expect this competition to increase. Based upon factors such as our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, the purchase price of the operations, prevailing market conditions, the availability of leadership to manage new operations and our own willingness to take on new operations, the rate at which we have historically acquired home health, hospice and senior living operations has fluctuated significantly. In the future, we anticipate the rate at which we may acquire these operations will continue to fluctuate, which may affect our revenue growth.\nWe have also historically acquired a few operations, either because they were included in larger, indivisible groups of operations or under other circumstances, which were or have proven to be non-strategic or less desirable, and we may consider disposing of such operations or exchanging them for operations which are more desirable.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquired operations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from our acquisitions.\nWe may not be able to successfully or efficiently integrate new acquisitions with our existing independent operating subsidiaries, culture and systems. The process of integrating acquisitions into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, divert management\u2019s attention from existing operations, or require an unexpected commitment of staff and financial resources, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. Existing operations available for acquisition frequently serve or target different markets than those that we currently serve. We also may determine that renovations of acquired operations and changes in staff and operating management personnel are necessary to successfully integrate those acquisitions into our existing operations. We may not be able to recover the costs incurred to reposition or renovate newly independent operating subsidiaries. The financial benefits we expect to realize from many of our acquisitions are largely dependent upon our ability to improve clinical performance, overcome regulatory deficiencies, rehabilitate or improve the reputation of the operations in the community, increase and maintain census, control costs, and in some cases change the patient acuity mix. If we are unable to accomplish any of these objectives at the independent operating subsidiaries we acquire, we will not realize the anticipated benefits and we may experience lower than anticipated profits, or even losses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company expanded its operations with the addition of two home health agencies, five hospice agencies, two home care agencies and two senior living operations. This growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our current leaders. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to successfully integrate new acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational, financial and management information systems and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage key employees, including our local leaders. We may not be successful in attracting qualified individuals necessary for future acquisitions to be successful, and our management team may expend significant time and energy working to attract qualified personnel to manage operations we may acquire in the future. Also, the newly acquired operations may require us to spend significant time improving services that have historically been substandard, and if we are unable to improve such operations quickly enough, we may be subject to litigation and/or loss of licensure or certification. If we are not able to successfully overcome these and other integration challenges, we may not achieve the benefits we expect from any of our acquisitions, and our business may suffer.\nIn undertaking acquisitions, we may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities and regulatory issues that may adversely affect our operations.\nIn undertaking acquisitions, we also may be adversely impacted by unforeseen liabilities attributable to the prior providers who operated the acquired operations, against whom we may have little or no recourse. Many operations we have historically acquired were underperforming financially and had clinical and regulatory issues prior to and at the time of acquisition. Even where we have improved independent operating subsidiaries and patient care at affiliated operations that we have acquired, we still may face post-acquisition regulatory issues related to pre-acquisition events. These may include, without\nlimitation, payment recoupment related to our predecessors\u2019 prior noncompliance, the imposition of fines, penalties, operational restrictions or special regulatory status. Further, we may incur post-acquisition compliance risk due to the difficulty or impossibility of immediately or quickly bringing non-compliant operations into full compliance. Diligence materials pertaining to acquisition targets, especially the underperforming operations that often represent the greatest opportunity for return, are often inadequate, inaccurate or impossible to obtain, sometimes requiring us to make acquisition decisions with incomplete information. Despite our due diligence procedures, operations that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may generate unexpectedly low returns, may cause us to incur substantial losses, may require unexpected levels of management time, expenditures or other resources, or may otherwise not meet a risk profile that our investors find acceptable.\nIn addition, we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any of the acquired operations, including contingent liabilities. When we acquire an operation, we generally assume its existing Medicare provider number for purposes of billing Medicare for services. If CMS later determines that the prior operator had received overpayments from Medicare for the period of time during which it operated, or had incurred fines in connection with service provided prior to our acquisition of the operation, CMS could hold us liable for repayment of the overpayments or fines.\nWe may be unable to improve every operation that we acquire. In addition, these operations may divert management time and attention from other operations and priorities, negatively impact cash flows, result in adverse or unanticipated accounting charges, or otherwise damage other areas of our company if they are not timely and adequately improved.\nWe also incur regulatory risk in acquiring certain operations due to the licensing, certification and other regulatory requirements affecting our right to operate the acquired operations. For example, in order to acquire operations on a predictable schedule, or to acquire declining operations quickly to prevent further pre-acquisition declines, we frequently acquire such operations prior to receiving license approval or provider certification. We operate as the interim manager for the outgoing licensee, assuming financial responsibility, among other obligations, for the operation. To the extent that we may be unable or delayed in obtaining a license, we may need to operate under a management agreement with the prior operator. Any inability in obtaining consent from the prior operator of a target acquisition to utilizing its license in this manner could impact our ability to acquire additional operations. If we were subsequently denied licensure or certification for any reason, we might not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition and would likely incur unanticipated costs and other challenges which could cause our business to suffer.\nIf we do not achieve and maintain competitive quality of care ratings from CMS and private organizations engaged in similar monitoring activities, our business may be negatively affected.\nProviding quality patient care is the cornerstone of our business. We believe that hospitals, physicians and other referral sources refer patients to us in large part because of our reputation for delivering quality care. Clinical quality is becoming increasingly important within our industry. Effective October 2012, Medicare began to impose a financial penalty upon hospitals that have excessive rates of patient readmissions within 30 days from hospital discharge. We believe this regulation provides a competitive advantage to home health providers who can differentiate themselves based upon quality, particularly by achieving low patient acute care hospitalization readmission rates and by implementing disease management programs designed to be responsive to the needs of patients served by referring hospitals. We are focused intently upon improving our patient outcomes, particularly our patient acute care hospitalization readmission rates. If we should fail to attain our goals regarding acute care hospitalization readmission rates and other quality metrics, we expect our ability to generate referrals would be adversely impacted, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and combined financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCMS provides comparative public data, rating every home health agency operating in each state based upon its Star Quality Rating System reported on consumer-facing websites. The Star rating may impact patient choice of home health agencies and reimbursement from home health agencies, as a higher Star rating indicates better patient care than a lower Star rating. A low Star rating may decrease the number of patients for Medicare reimbursement.\nIf we are unable to obtain insurance, or if insurance becomes more costly for us to obtain, our business may be adversely affected.\nIt may become more difficult and costly for us to obtain coverage for patient care liabilities and other risks, including property and casualty insurance. For example, the following circumstances may adversely affect our ability to obtain insurance at favorable rates:\n\u2022we experience higher-than-expected professional liability, property and casualty, or other types of claims or losses;\n\u2022we receive survey deficiencies or citations of higher-than-normal scope or severity;\n\u2022we acquire especially troubled operations that present unattractive risks to current or prospective insurers;\n\u2022insurers tighten underwriting standards applicable to us or our industry; or\n\u2022insurers or reinsurers are unable or unwilling to insure us or the industry at historical premiums and coverage levels.\nIf any of these potential circumstances were to occur, our insurance carriers may require us to pay substantially higher premiums for the same or reduced coverage for insurance, including workers compensation, property and casualty, automobile, employment practices liability, directors and officers liability, employee healthcare and general and professional liability coverages.\nIn some states, the law prohibits or limits insurance coverage for the risk of punitive damages arising from professional liability and general liability claims or litigation. Coverage for punitive damages is also excluded under some insurance policies. As a result, we may be liable for punitive damage awards in these states that either are not covered or are in excess of our insurance policy limits. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also could inhibit our ability to attract patients or expand our business and could require our management to devote time to matters unrelated to the day-to-day operation of our business.\nWith few exceptions, workers\u2019 compensation and employee health insurance costs have increased markedly in recent years. As a result, our insurance deductibles in connection with general and professional liability and auto claims have also increased. We also have purchased insurance coverage for workers compensation in all states except Washington and Wyoming. In those states workers compensation coverage is provided by a state fund and financed through premiums paid by the employers and employees. We have elected non-subscriber status for workers\u2019 compensation in Texas. If we are unable to obtain insurance, or if insurance becomes more costly for us to obtain, or if the coverage levels we can economically obtain decline, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe retain certain risks related to our insurance coverage.\nThe Company retains commercial insurance for worker\u2019s compensation and professional and general liabilities and bares the risk of loss until the deductibles for each claim is met. The Company recognizes obligations associated with these costs, up to specified deductible limits in the period in which a claim is incurred, including with respect to both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported. These costs have generally been estimated by an actuary based on historical data of our claims experience. Any actuarial projection of self-insured losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Since recorded amounts are based on estimates, the ultimate cost of all incurred claims and related expenses may be more or less than the recorded liabilities.\nThe unionization of our workers may adversely affect our revenue and our profitability.\nWe maintain our right to inform the employees of our independent operating subsidiaries about our views of the potential impact of unionization upon the workplace generally and upon individual employees. To our knowledge, employees at our independent operating subsidiaries that have been approached to unionize have uniformly rejected union organizing efforts. If employees decide to unionize, our cost of doing business could increase, and we could experience contract delays, difficulty in adapting to a changing regulatory and economic environment, cultural conflicts between unionized and non-unionized employees, strikes and work stoppages, and we may conclude that affected operations would be uneconomical to continue operating.\nBecause we lease all of our affiliated senior living communities, we could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions and special charges, which could adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we leased all of our senior living communities and administrative offices. Most of our leases are triple-net leases, which means that, in addition to rent, we are required to pay for the costs related to the property (including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance and repair costs). We are responsible for paying these costs notwithstanding the fact that some of the benefits associated with paying these costs accrue to the landlords as owners of the associated communities.\nSpecifically, as of December 31, 2019, our independent operating subsidiaries leased 29 senior living operations pursuant to certain \u201ctriple-net\u201d lease agreements between our independent operating subsidiaries and subsidiaries of Ensign (the \u201cEnsign Leases\u201d), which were amended and restated in connection with the Spin-Off. The Ensign Leases are for initial terms ranging between 14 and 16 years. Fifteen of our affiliated senior living communities, excluding those operated under the Ensign Leases, are operated under two separate master lease arrangements. Under these master leases, a breach at a single community could subject one or more of the other communities covered by the same master lease to the same default risk. Failure to comply with provider requirements is a default under several of the leases and master lease agreements. In addition, other potential defaults related to an individual community may cause a default of an entire master lease portfolio and could trigger cross-default provisions in our outstanding debt arrangements and other leases. With an indivisible lease, it is difficult to restructure the composition of the portfolio or economic terms of the lease without the consent of the landlord.\nEach lease provides that the landlord may terminate the lease for a number of reasons, including, subject to applicable cure periods, the default in any payment of rent, taxes or other payment obligations or the breach of any other covenant or agreement in the lease. Any default under the Ensign Leases or the other master lease agreements could be declared an event of default under such agreements, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness and the potential loss of certain of our communities. Any such occurrence would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and profitability. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with all of our obligations under the leases in the future.\nA housing downturn could decrease demand for assisted living services.\nSeniors often use the proceeds of home sales to fund their admission to assisted living communities. A downturn in the housing markets could adversely affect seniors\u2019 ability to afford our resident fees and entrance fees. If national or local housing markets enter a persistent decline, our occupancy rates, revenues, results of operations and cash flow could be negatively impacted.\nIf our referral sources fail to view us as an attractive provider, or if our referral sources otherwise refer fewer patients, our patient base may decrease.\nWe rely significantly on appropriate referrals from physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers in the communities we serve to attract appropriate residents and patients to our affiliated operations. Our referral sources are not obligated to refer business to us and may refer business to other healthcare providers. We believe many of our referral sources refer business to us as a result of our quality patient care and our commitment to partnerships and communication. If we lose, or fail to maintain, existing relationships with our referral resources, fail to develop new relationships, or if we are perceived by our referral sources as not providing high quality patient care, our census could decline and our patient mix could change. In addition, if any of our referral sources have a reduction in patients whom they can refer due to a decrease in their business, our census could decline and patient mix could change.\nFailure to generate sufficient cash flow to cover required payments or meet operating covenants under our long-term debt, including debt entered into in connection with the Spin-Off and long-term operating leases, could result in defaults under such agreements and cross-defaults under other debt or operating lease arrangements, which could harm our independent operating subsidiaries and cause us to lose operations or experience foreclosures.\nWe have significant future operating lease obligations. We intend to continue financing our operations through long-term operating leases, mortgage financing and other types of financing, including borrowings under our future credit facilities we may obtain. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover required interest, principal and lease payments.\nOur ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to make lease payments on our operating leases depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our business, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or to make lease payments on our operating leases, we may be required, among other things, to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected assets, reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or delay or abandon desirable acquisitions. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to make lease payments on our operating leases. The failure to make required payments on our debt or operating leases or the delay or abandonment of our planned growth strategy could result in an adverse effect on our future ability to generate revenue and sustain profitability. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on terms that are economically favorable to us, or at all.\nAdditionally, in connection with the Spin-Off, we incurred indebtedness and are responsible for servicing our own indebtedness and obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital and other funds to satisfy our cash requirements. Our financing arrangements contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by restricting our ability to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or requiring us to offer to repurchase such indebtedness in the event of a change of control or a change of control triggering event; pay dividends or make distributions; make investments or acquisitions; sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets; create liens; consolidate or merge; enter into transactions with affiliates; and prepay and repurchase or redeem certain indebtedness. In addition, our financing costs be higher than they were prior to the Spin-Off from Ensign.\nChanges in the method of determining London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur indebtedness is made at variable interest rates that use LIBOR (or metrics derived from or related to LIBOR) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established, or alternative reference rates to be established. The potential consequences cannot be fully predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. Changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce our earnings and cash flows. In addition, any transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that rely on LIBOR, reductions in the value of certain instruments or the effectiveness of related transactions such as hedges, increased borrowing costs, uncertainty under applicable documentation, or difficult and costly consent processes. This could materially and adversely effect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks.\nWe may need additional capital to finance our growth, and we may not be able to obtain it on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which may limit our ability to grow.\nOur ability to maintain and enhance our independent operating subsidiaries and equipment in a suitable condition to meet regulatory standards, operate efficiently and remain competitive in our markets requires us to commit substantial resources to continued investment in our affiliated operations. We are sometimes more aggressive than our competitors in capital spending to address issues that arise in connection with aging and obsolete facilities and equipment. In addition, continued expansion of our business through the acquisition of existing operations, expansion of our existing operations and construction of new communities may require additional capital, particularly if we were to accelerate our acquisition and expansion plans. Financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable. If we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain additional funds on terms acceptable to us, we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our growth strategies. Further, if additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be diluted. Any newly issued equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock.\nThe condition of the financial markets, including volatility and deterioration in the capital and credit markets, could limit the availability of debt and equity financing sources to fund the capital and liquidity requirements of our business, as well as negatively impact or impair the value of our future portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and investments.\nCredit markets are cyclical. Volatility in financial and credit markets may reduce the availability of certain types of debt financing and restrict the availability of credit.\nFurther, we anticipate that our future cash, cash equivalents and investments may be held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments. As a result of the uncertain domestic and global political, credit and financial market conditions, investments in these types of instruments pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns.\nThough we anticipate that the cash amounts generated internally, together with amounts available under our future debt instruments, will be sufficient to implement our business plan for the foreseeable future, we may need additional capital if a substantial acquisition or other growth opportunity becomes available or if unexpected events occur or opportunities arise. We cannot assure you that additional capital will be available or available on terms favorable to us. If capital is not available, we may not be able to fund internal or external business expansion or respond to competitive pressures or other market conditions.\nDelays in reimbursement may cause liquidity problems.\nIf we experience problems with our billing information systems or if issues arise with Medicare, Medicaid or other payors, we may encounter delays in our payment cycle. From time to time, we have experienced such delays as a result of government payors instituting planned reimbursement delays for budget balancing purposes or as a result of prepayment reviews.\nSome states in which we operate are operating with budget deficits or could have a budget deficit in the future, which may delay reimbursement in a manner that would adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, from time to time, procedural issues require us to resubmit claims before payment is remitted, which contributes to our aged receivables. Unanticipated delays in receiving reimbursement from state programs due to changes in their policies or billing or audit procedures may adversely impact our liquidity and working capital. As discussed in Item 1., Government Regulation, with the reduction in fiscal year 2020 and elimination in fiscal year 2021 of RAPs, we may experience higher receivables as collections are delayed upon implementation.\nCompliance with the regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) may require us to make unanticipated expenditures which could increase our costs.\nSeventeen of our affiliated senior living communities are currently subject to regulatory agreements with HUD that give the Commissioner of HUD broad authority to require us to be replaced as the operator of those communities in the event that the Commissioner determines there are operational deficiencies at such communities under HUD regulations. Compliance with HUD\u2019s requirements can often be difficult because these requirements are not always consistent with the requirements of other federal and state agencies. Appealing a failed inspection can be costly and time-consuming and, if we do not successfully remediate the failed inspection, we could be precluded from obtaining HUD financing in the future or we may encounter limitations or prohibitions on our operation of HUD-insured communities.\nFailure to comply with existing environmental laws could result in increased expenditures, litigation and potential loss to our business and in our asset value.\nOur independent operating subsidiaries are subject to regulations under various federal, state and local environmental laws, primarily those relating to the handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of medical waste; the identification and warning of the presence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, as well as the encapsulation or removal of such materials; and the presence of other substances in the indoor environment.\nOur affiliated operations generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the patients. Each of our affiliated operations has an agreement with a waste management company for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste, but the use of a waste management company does not immunize us from alleged violations of such laws for independent operating subsidiaries for which we are responsible even if carried out by a third party, nor does it immunize us from third-party claims for the cost to cleanup disposal sites at which such wastes have been disposed.\nSome of the affiliated senior living communities we lease or may acquire may have asbestos-containing materials. Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building\u2019s management to identify and warn their employees and other employers operating in the building of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials in their buildings. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. Building owners and those exercising control over a building\u2019s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and disposal of asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. Such laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release into the environment of asbestos- containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials. The presence of asbestos-containing materials, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such materials, also may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain patients and staff, to borrow when using such property as collateral or to make improvements to such property.\nThe presence of mold, lead-based paint, underground storage tanks, contaminants in drinking water, radon and/or other substances at any of the affiliated senior living communities we lease, own or may acquire may lead to the incurrence of costs for remediation, mitigation or the implementation of an operations and maintenance plan and may result in third party litigation\nfor personal injury or property damage. Furthermore, in some circumstances, areas affected by mold may be unusable for periods of time for repairs, and even after successful remediation, the known prior presence of extensive mold could adversely affect the ability of a community to retain or attract patients and staff and could adversely affect a community\u2019s market value and ultimately could lead to the temporary or permanent closure of the community.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws, we would face increased expenditures in terms of fines and remediation of the underlying problems, potential litigation relating to exposure to such materials, and a potential decrease in value to our business and in the value of our underlying assets.\nIn addition, because environmental laws vary from state to state, expansion of our independent operating subsidiaries to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions in the conduct and management of our affiliated operations.\nWe are a holding company with no operations and rely upon our independent operating subsidiaries to provide us with the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations. Liabilities of any one or more of our subsidiaries could be imposed upon us or our other subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company with no direct operating assets, employees or revenues. Each of our affiliated operations is operated through a separate, independent subsidiary, which has its own management, employees and assets. Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our independent operating subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and have no obligation to make funds available to us. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us will depend substantially on their respective operating results and will be subject to restrictions under, among other things, the laws of their jurisdiction of organization, which may limit the amount of funds available for distribution to investors or stockholders, agreements of those subsidiaries, the terms of our financing arrangements and the terms of any future financing arrangements of our subsidiaries.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from our Spin-Off from Ensign.\nWe believe that as a standalone, independent public company, our results benefit from, among other things, allowing our leaders to design and implement company-wide policies and strategies that are based primarily on the characteristics of our business, allowing us to focus our financial resources wholly on our own operations and implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our own specific needs. However, by being separated from Ensign, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been were we still a part of Ensign. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have no operating history as a separate public company; our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results; we may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent company, and as a result, we may experience increased costs.\nPrior to the Spin-Off, Ensign performed various corporate functions for us, including executive management, accounting, human resources, information technology, legal, payroll, insurance, tax, treasury, and other general and administrative items. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Ensign for these and similar functions that may be less than the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company. Prior to the Spin-Off, we shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and relationships with our partners. While we have entered into short-term transition agreements and certain other longer-term agreements that govern certain commercial and other relationships between us and Ensign, those arrangements may not capture the benefits our business has enjoyed as a result of being integrated with the other affiliates of Ensign.\nGenerally, our working capital requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, have historically been satisfied as part of the company-wide cash management policies of Ensign. Following the completion of the Spin-Off, Ensign no longer provides us with funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements, and we may need to obtain financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements. We may be unable to replace in a timely manner or on comparable terms and costs the services or other benefits that Ensign previously provided to us.\nThe loss of the benefits from being a part of Ensign could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, leadership, financing and business operations as a result of our operating as a company separate from Ensign.\nWe may have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we received in our agreements with Ensign entered into in connection with the Spin-Off.\nThe agreements related to the Spin-Off from Ensign were negotiated in the context of the Spin-Off from Ensign while we were still part of Ensign. Although these agreements are intended to be on an arm\u2019s-length basis, they may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations among unaffiliated third parties. The terms of the agreements being negotiated in the context of the separation are related to, among other things, allocations of assets and liabilities, rights and indemnification and other obligations between us and Ensign. To the extent that certain terms of those agreements provide for rights and obligations that could have been procured from third parties, we may have received better terms from third parties because third parties may have competed with each other to win our business. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Agreements with Ensign Related to the Spin-Off.\u201d\nThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. We are in the process of designing, implementing, and testing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with the obligation of furnishing a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which process is time consuming, costly, and complicated.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected, and the market price of our stock could decline.\nThe Spin-Off and related transactions may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nWhile we believe that we and Ensign were adequately capitalized immediately after the Spin-Off, the Spin-Off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor could claim that Ensign did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the Spin-Off, and that the Spin-Off left Ensign insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that Ensign intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the Spin-Off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, returning our assets or your shares in our company to Ensign or providing Ensign with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Ensign and the fair market value of our company at the time of the Spin-Off.\nOur success will depend in part on our ongoing relationship with Ensign after the Spin-Off.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we have entered into a number of agreements with Ensign that govern the ongoing relationships between Ensign and us after the Spin-Off. We also established the Ensign Pennant Care Continuum, a voluntary post-acute preferred provider network that provide for robust data sharing and the implementation of tailored transitional care pathways between Ensign and Pennant affiliates. Our success will depend, in part, on the maintenance of these ongoing relationships with Ensign, and Ensign\u2019s performance of its obligations under these agreements. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with Ensign, or if Ensign does not perform its obligations under these agreements or does not renew such agreements following their expiration, our profitability and revenues could decrease and our growth potential may be adversely affected.\nCertain of our directors will continue to serve as directors of the Ensign board of directors, and ownership of shares of Ensign common stock or equity awards of Ensign by our directors and executive officers may create conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest.\nCertain of our directors who serve on our board of directors continue to serve on the Ensign board of directors. This could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or Ensign\u2019s management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and Ensign, including the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Spin-Off and the relationship between us and Ensign after the Spin-Off, any commercial agreements entered into in the future between us and Ensign and the allocation of such directors\u2019 time between us and Ensign.\nBecause of their current or former positions with Ensign, substantially all of our executive officers and some of our non-employee directors will own shares of Ensign common stock. The continued ownership of Ensign common stock by Pennant\u2019s directors and executive officers following the Spin-Off creates or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and Ensign.\nIf the distribution of shares of our common stock in connection with the Spin-Off (the \u201cDistribution\u201d), together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, then our stockholders, we and Ensign might be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes (including as a result of indemnification under the tax matters agreement).\nThe Distribution was conditioned upon Ensign\u2019s receipt of an opinion of Kirkland & Ellis LLP to the effect that, subject to the assumptions and limitations described therein, the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, qualified as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code in which no gain or loss is recognized by Ensign or its stockholders, except, in the case of Ensign stockholders, for cash received in lieu of fractional shares. The opinion of Kirkland & Ellis LLP was based on, among other things, certain assumptions as well as on the continuing accuracy of certain factual representations and statements that we and Ensign made to Kirkland & Ellis LLP. In rendering its opinion, Kirkland & Ellis LLP also relied on certain covenants that we and Ensign entered into. If any of the representations or statements that we or Ensign made are or become inaccurate or incomplete, or if we or Ensign breach any of our covenants, the Distribution and such related transactions might not qualify for such tax treatment. The opinion of Kirkland & Ellis LLP is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or a court, and there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge the validity of the Distribution and such related transactions as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code eligible for tax-free treatment, or that any such challenge ultimately will not prevail.\nIf the Spin-Off or any other related transaction does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for any reason, including as a result of a breach of a representation or covenant, Ensign or other members of its affiliated group would recognize a substantial gain attributable to us for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the Ensign consolidated group at the time of the Spin-Off would be jointly and severally liable for the entire resulting amount of any U.S. federal income tax liability. Additionally, a disqualified spin-off would be a taxable distribution to Ensign stockholders. At least a portion of the Distribution would be a taxable dividend. If the Distribution is not entirely a taxable dividend, stockholders will need to reduce their basis in the shares and potentially have taxable capital gains.\nWe may not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the Spin-Off because of certain restrictions related to preserving the tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off. In addition, we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capital-raising transactions.\nOur ability to engage in significant strategic transactions and equity issuances may be limited or restricted for a period of time in order to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the Spin-Off. Even if the Spin-Off otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, it may result in corporate level taxable gain to Ensign under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50.0% or more, by vote or value, of shares of our stock or Ensign\u2019s stock are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Spin-Off. The process for determining whether an acquisition or issuance triggering these provisions has occurred is complex, inherently factual and subject to interpretation of the facts and circumstances of a particular case. Any acquisitions or issuances of our stock or Ensign stock within a two-year period after the Spin-Off generally are presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or Ensign, as applicable, may be able to rebut that presumption.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Ensign, we also are generally responsible for any taxes imposed on Ensign that arise from the failure of the Spin-Off to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, within\nthe meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to our stock, assets or business, or a breach of the relevant representations or any covenants made by us in the tax matters agreement or the representation letter provided to counsel in connection with the tax opinion of Kirkland & Ellis LLP.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, and any decision on our part to comply with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we currently intend to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our registration statements, periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the Distribution; (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year during which our total annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nIn addition, as our business grows, we may cease to satisfy the conditions of an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Under the JOBS Act, \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d\nWe are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these new rules, and we may not be able to take advantage of all of the benefits from the JOBS Act.\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to sell your shares at an attractive price or at all.\nThe market price for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile, in part because our shares have not been traded publicly for long. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control. For many reasons, including the risks identified in this report on Form 10-K, the market price of our common stock following the Spin-Off may be more volatile than the market price of Ensign common stock before the consummation of the Spin-Off. These factors may result in short-term or long-term negative pressure on the value of our common stock. Stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nYour percentage ownership in Pennant may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that we expect will be issued to our directors and officers and employees of our subsidiaries and the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards with respect to our common stock.\nYour percentage ownership in Pennant may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that we expect will be issued to our directors and officers and employees of our subsidiaries and the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards with respect to our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that became effective immediately prior to the consummation of this Spin-Off contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022provide for the election of directors by a plurality of the votes cast at the annual stockholder meeting;\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022create a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022limit the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022limit the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings; and\n\u2022control the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of becoming a public company, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. As a result of the Spin-Off, we are obligated to file with the SEC annual and quarterly reports and other reports that are specified in Section 13 and other sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). We also are required to ensure that we have the ability to prepare financial statements that are fully compliant with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. In addition, we are subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including certain requirements of NASDAQ, and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant compliance obligations upon us.\nThe expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation. In addition, if we fail to implement the requirements with respect to our internal accounting and audit functions, our ability to report our operating results on a timely and accurate basis could be impaired. If we do not implement such requirements in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC and NASDAQ. Any such action could harm our reputation and the confidence of investors and customers in us and could materially adversely affect our business and cause our share price to fall.\nAfter we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we expect to incur additional management time and cost to comply with the more stringent reporting requirements applicable to companies that are deemed accelerated filers or large accelerated filers, including complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. See \u201c-We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, and any decision on our part to comply with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\u201d\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company or our company\u2019s directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any (1) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (2) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or agent of our company to our company or our stockholders, or any claim for aiding and abetting any such alleged breach, (3) action asserting a claim against our company or any director or officer of our company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or (4) action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer of our company governed by the internal affairs doctrine except for, as to each of (1) through (4) above, any claim (a) as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (b) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (c) arising under the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as to which the Court of Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall concurrently be the sole and exclusive forums. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this paragraph will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a \u201cforeign action\u201d) in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an \u201cenforcement action\u201d), and (y) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such enforcement action by service upon such stockholder\u2019s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such stockholder.\nThis choice-of-forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.", "PERMNO": 18913, "SIC": 8050, "TIC": "PNTG"}
