{"cik": "939930", "company": "PYXUS INTERNATIONAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-06-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity\nWe may not be able to achieve our stated goals, which may adversely affect our liquidity.\nEven though the Plan has been consummated, we continue to face a number of risks, such as changes in economic conditions, continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in the leaf tobacco market and the markets for our other products, other changes in demand for our products and increasing expenses. We may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business, including short-term operating credit lines to fund the needs of our non-U.S. local leaf tobacco operations. Our access to necessary financing may be limited, if it is available at all. Therefore, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\nDevelopments with respect to our liquidity needs and sources of liquidity could result in a deficiency in liquidity.\nOur liquidity requirements are affected by various factors from our core tobacco leaf business, including crop seasonality, foreign currency and interest rates, green tobacco prices, customer mix and shipping requirements, crop size, and quality. Our leaf tobacco business is seasonal, and purchasing, processing, and selling activities have several associated peaks where cash on-hand and outstanding indebtedness may vary significantly during the fiscal year. We anticipate periods in the next twelve months during which our liquidity needs will approach the levels of our anticipated available cash and permitted borrowings under our credit facilities. Developments affecting our liquidity needs, including with respect to the foregoing factors, and sources of liquidity, including impacts affecting our cash flows from operations (including as a result of delays with respect to the anticipated timing of shipments of leaf tobacco, whether due to the impact of COVID-19 or customer preferences) and the availability of capital resources (including an inability to renew or refinance seasonal lines of credit), may result in a deficiency in liquidity. To address a potential liquidity deficiency, we may continue to undertake plans to minimize cash outflows, which could include exiting operations that do not generate positive cash flow. It is possible that, depending on the occurrence of events affecting our liquidity needs and sources of liquidity, such plans may not be sufficient to adequately or timely address a liquidity deficiency.\nWe may be unable to continue to access short-term operating credit lines to fund local operations on terms that are acceptable or at all.\nWe have historically financed our non-U.S. local leaf tobacco operations with short-term operating credit lines at the local level. These operating lines are typically seasonal in nature, corresponding to the tobacco crop cycle in that location. Certain of these facilities are uncommitted in that the lenders have the right to cease making loans or demand payment of outstanding loans at any time. Moreover, as these facilities mature, local lenders may not renew them or otherwise offer replacement financing facilities. Since the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the terms and conditions on which certain local lenders have agreed to offer short-term operating credit lines have become more restrictive. If local lenders lose confidence in us, they may cease making loans or demand payment of outstanding loans with respect to uncommitted facilities or, with respect to committed facilities, decline to renew or extend existing facilities, or require stricter terms and conditions with respect to future facilities. We may not find these terms and conditions acceptable or they may overly restrict our ability to conduct our\nbusinesses successfully. An inability to maintain adequate financing to fund our non-U.S. local leaf tobacco operations in any significant location could result in a significant decline in our revenues, profitability and cash flow and may require us to exit operations in that jurisdiction.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial debt which may adversely affect us by limiting future sources of financing, interfering with our ability to pay interest, and principal on our indebtedness and subjecting us to additional risks.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and debt service obligations. As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately $925.5 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness. This indebtedness included (i) approximately $67.5 million of outstanding borrowings pursuant to an Exit ABL Credit Agreement (the \u201cABL Credit Agreement\u201d), dated as of August 24, 2020 by and among, amongst others, our Pyxus Holdings, Inc. subsidiary (\u201cPyxus Holdings\u201d), certain lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and collateral agent which governs an asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL Credit Facility\u201d) which permits borrowings in an initial maximum principal amount of $75.0 million, subject to certain limitations, and matures on February 24, 2023, (ii) approximately $215.6 million in aggregate principal amount of term loans (the \u201cTerm Loans\u201d) under an Exit Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of August 24, 2020 (the \u201cTerm Loan Credit Agreement\u201d), by and among, amongst others, Pyxus Holdings, certain lenders party thereto and Alter Domus (US) LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, which Term Loans mature on February 24, 2025, (iii) approximately $267.4 million in aggregate principal amount of 10.00% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2024 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) of Pyxus Holdings pursuant to an Indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) dated as of August 24, 2020 among Pyxus Holdings, the initial guarantors party thereto (including Pyxus International, Inc.), and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, and collateral agent, which Notes mature on August 24, 2024, and (iv) approximately $116.4 million in aggregate outstanding borrowings under a Second Amendment and Restatement Agreement (the \u201cTDB Facility Agreement\u201d) among Alliance One International Holdings, Ltd., a subsidiary of Pyxus and the Company\u2019s subsidiaries in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia and Eastern and Southern African Trade and Development Bank (\u201cTDB\u201d), which TDB Facility Agreement terminates on June 30, 2021 for Kenya and Uganda and on June 30, 2022 for Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia and may be renewed at TDB\u2019s discretion. Such indebtedness does not include borrowings under a $120.0 million delayed-draw term loan lending facility (the \u201cDDTL Facility\u201d) established under a term loan credit agreement (the \u201cDDTL Facility Credit Agreement\u201d) dated April 23, 2021 among Intabex Netherlands B.V. (\u201cIntabex\u201d), our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, as the borrower, the Company, Pyxus Holdings, Pyxus Parent, Inc., Alliance One International, LLC and Alliance One International Holdings, Ltd as guarantors, and certain funds managed by Glendon Capital Management LP and Monarch Alternative Capital LP, as lenders, which borrowings were $120.0 million at June 29, 2021.\nOur substantial debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the ABL Credit Facility, the Term Loans, the Notes, the DDTL Facility and our other obligations;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms and to otherwise fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt refinancing, acquisitions, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022hampering our ability to adjust to changing market conditions;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, and the industries in which we operate; and\n\u2022restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities.\nWe require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nWe require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness, and a substantial portion of our cash flow is required to fund the interest payments on our indebtedness. Our ability to service our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, a substantial portion of our debt, including any borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility, bears interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable-rate debt will create higher debt-service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow. We cannot assure you that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nWe may not be able to refinance or renew our indebtedness, including the ABL Credit Facility, the Term Loans, the Notes, the DDTL Facility, or indebtedness under the TDB Facility Agreement, other seasonal credit lines, or other credit facilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to renew or refinance our indebtedness, including the ABL Credit Facility, the Term Loans, the Notes, the DDTL Facility or indebtedness under the TDB Facility Agreement, other seasonal credit lines, or other credit facilities, on substantially similar terms, or at all. Our ability to access short-term and long-term lending and capital markets to obtain, and the availability of acceptable terms and conditions of, financing are impacted by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings; (ii) the liquidity and volatility of the overall lending and capital markets; and (iii) the current state of the economy, including the tobacco industry. There can be no assurances that we will be able to access the lending and capital markets to refinance our indebtedness. We may have to pay additional fees and expenses that we might not have to pay under normal circumstances, and we may have to agree to terms that could increase the cost of our debt structure. If we are unable to renew or refinance our indebtedness on terms that are not materially less favorable than the terms currently available to us or obtain alternative or additional financing arrangements, we may not be able to timely repay certain of our indebtedness, which may result in a default under other indebtedness. Failure to refinance or renew any material indebtedness would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to satisfy the covenants included in our financing arrangements, which could result in the default of our outstanding debt obligations.\nThe agreement governing the ABL Credit Facility includes certain restrictive covenants and a springing covenant requiring that our fixed charge coverage ratio be no less than 1.00 to 1.00 during any cash dominion period under the ABL Credit Agreement. Certain agreements governing our seasonal credit facilities, including the TDB Agreement, include financial and restrictive covenants applicable to the subsidiaries that borrow thereunder and in certain cases with respect to Pyxus. The agreements governing our other indebtedness, including the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Indenture and the DDTL Facility Credit Agreement, also include restrictive covenants. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022pay dividends and make other restricted payments;\n\u2022sell certain assets;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022designate subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement, the Indenture and the Term Loan Credit Agreement).\nComplying with these covenants may cause us to take actions that we otherwise would not take or not take actions that we otherwise would take.\nOur failure to comply with certain of these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of a substantial portion of our indebtedness, much of which is cross-defaulted to other indebtedness. In the past, we sought and obtained waivers and amendments under our then-existing financing arrangements to avoid future non-compliance with financial covenants and cure past defaults under restrictive covenants, including recent waivers with respect to financial covenants included in the TDB Facility Agreement and waivers under the Indenture, ABL Credit Facility and the Term Loan Credit Agreement with respect to the commencement of the CCAA Proceeding and the contemplated disposition of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries. We also paid significant fees to obtain certain of these waivers and consents. You should consider this in evaluating our ability to comply with financial and restrictive covenants in our debt instruments and the financial costs of our ability to do so. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with, or obtain waivers and amendments related to, financial or restrictive covenants in the future.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate further the risks associated with our significant leverage.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to the extent permitted under the ABL Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Indenture and the DDTL Facility Credit Agreement. As of March 31, 2021, $352.6 million was available for borrowing under our short and long-term credit facilities. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks discussed above could intensify.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nWe have been and will likely continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic and its related impacts to our employees, operations, customers and suppliers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is likely to continue to adversely affect, our businesses, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience delays in shipments of leaf tobacco and other disruptions to our operations. Although, in many jurisdictions, our operations have been classified as \u201cessential\u201d under various governmental orders restricting business activities implemented in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, that classification has not been universal and\nwe have been, and may in the future be, required to suspend operations at certain facilities as a result of similar governmental orders. We cannot predict whether our operations classified as \u201cessential\u201d will continue to be so classified or, even if so classified, whether site-specific health and safety concerns related to COVID-19 might otherwise require operations at any of our facilities to be halted for some period of time. Other operational disruptions may result from restrictions on the ability of employees and others in the supply chain to travel and work, such as caused by quarantine or individual illness, or which may result from border closures imposed by governments to deter the spread of COVID-19, or determinations by us or shippers to temporarily suspend operations in affected areas, or other actions which restrict the ability to ship our products or which may otherwise negatively impact our ability to ship our products. Ports or channels of entry may be closed, operate at only a portion of capacity or require quarantining of vessels, or transportation of products within a region or country may be limited, if workers are unable to report to work due to travel restrictions or personal illness. These factors have also impacted certain of our suppliers and we have been and will likely continue to be impacted by disruptions in the supply of certain materials used in our operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may further damage our business due to negative consumer purchasing behavior with respect to the products of our leaf tobacco customers and our other products. Public health officials around the world have recommended, and local, state, and national governments have mandated, precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including prohibitions on congregating in groups, shelter-in-place orders or similar measures. Consumer purchasing behavior may be impacted by reduced consumption by consumers who may not be able to leave home or otherwise shop in a normal manner as a result of these restrictions. In addition, in view of uncertainties with respect to the spread of COVID-19 and the duration and terms of related governmental orders restricting activities, we cannot predict whether demand for our products will persist at current levels or decrease on a global or regional basis.\nDue to the scope of our operations, including emerging markets, and our sale to customers around the world, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and the demand for our products may not coincide with impacts experienced in the United States in the event that the impacts in the United States improve over time due to increased vaccinations or improved medical treatments. Accordingly, to the extent that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States may improve over time, results of operations may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 impacts in other areas of the world.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy\nOur Board of Directors was reconstituted in connection with and following the effectiveness of the Plan in the Chapter 11 Cases and may implement changes in our business strategy that could affect the scope of our operations, including the countries in which we continue to operate and the business lines that we continue to pursue, and may result in the recognition of restructuring or asset impairment charges.\nOur corporate business strategy is subject to continued development and evaluation by our management and Board of Directors. In connection with the effectiveness of the Plan in the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors was reconstituted, with six of the seven members of the Board of Directors having joined the Board of Directors on or after the August 24, 2020 effective date of the Plan. The new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the Board of Directors of Old Pyxus at the time of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine our future, including our strategic plans. The Board of Directors, as reconstituted, has determined to change our business strategy and exit our industrial hemp and Canadian cannabis businesses. The Board of Directors may further determine, from time to time, to implement additional changes in our business strategy, which could affect the scope of our operations, including the countries in which we continue to operate and the business lines that we continue to pursue. Such changes could result in our incurring restructuring charges or the impairment of assets that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Leaf Tobacco Operations\nOur reliance on a small number of significant customers may adversely affect our financial statements.\nThe customers of our leaf tobacco business are manufacturers of cigarette and other tobacco products. Several of these customers individually may account for a significant portion of our sales in a normal year. For the year ended March 31, 2021, Philip Morris International Inc. accounted for more than 10% of our revenues from continuing operations. In addition, tobacco product manufacturers have experienced consolidation and further consolidation among our customers could decrease such customers\u2019 demand for our leaf tobacco or processing services. The loss of any one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nContinued vertical integration by our customers could materially adversely affect our financial statements.\nDemand for our leaf tobacco or processing services could be materially reduced if cigarette manufacturers continue to significantly vertically integrate their operations, either through acquisition of our competitors, establishing new operations or contracting directly with suppliers. Japan Tobacco, Inc. has vertically integrated operations in Malawi, Brazil, and the United States. In addition, Philip Morris International Inc. acquired supplier contracts and related assets in Brazil in order to procure\nleaf directly. In general, our results of operations have been adversely affected by vertical integration initiatives. Although some customers have reversed certain aspects of their previous vertical integration of operations, further vertical integration by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nGlobal shifts in sourcing customer requirements may negatively affect our organizational structure and asset base.\nThe global leaf tobacco industry has experienced shifts in the sourcing of customer requirements for tobacco. For example, significant tobacco production volume decreases have occurred in the United States and Europe from historical levels. At the same time, production volumes in other sourcing origins have stabilized. Additional shifts in sourcing may occur as a result of currency fluctuations, including changes in currency exchange rates against the United States Dollar (\"USD\"), the imposition of tariffs and other changes in international trade policies. A shift in sourcing origins in Europe has been influenced by modifications to the tobacco price support system in the European Union. Customer requirements have changed due to these variations in production, which could influence our ability to plan effectively for the longer term in the United States and Europe.\nWe may not be able to timely or efficiently adjust to shifts in sourcing origins, and adjusting to shifts may require changes in our production facilities in certain origins and changes in our fixed asset base. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, restructuring charges as we continue to adjust to shifts in sourcing. Adjusting our capacity and adjusting to shifts in sourcing may have an adverse impact on our ability to manage our costs and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur financial results will vary according to growing conditions, customer indications, and other factors, which significantly impacts our ability to forecast our quarterly and annual financial performance.\nOur financial results, particularly the quarterly financial results, may be significantly affected by fluctuations in tobacco growing seasons and crop sizes which affect the supply of tobacco. Crop sizes may be affected by, among other things, crop infestation and disease, the volume of annual tobacco plantings and yields realized by suppliers, and suppliers' elections to grow crops other than tobacco. The cultivation period for tobacco is dependent upon a number of factors, including the weather and other natural events, such as hurricanes or tropical storms, and our processing schedule and results of operations for any quarterly period can be significantly altered by these factors.\nThe cost of acquiring tobacco can fluctuate greatly due to crop sizes and increased competition in certain markets in which we purchase tobacco. For example, short crops in periods of high demand translate into higher average green prices, higher throughput costs and less volume to sell. Furthermore, large crops translate into lower average green prices, lower throughput costs and excess volume to sell.\nThe timing and unpredictability of customer indications, orders, and shipments cause us to keep tobacco in inventory, increase our risk, and result in variations in quarterly and annual financial results. The timing of shipments can be materially impacted by shortages of containers and vessels for shipping as well as infrastructure and accessibility issues in ports we use for shipment. We may, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, keep a significant amount of processed tobacco in inventory for our customers to accommodate their inventory management and other needs. Sales recognition by us and our subsidiaries is based on the passage of ownership, usually with shipment of product. Because individual shipments may represent significant amounts of revenue, our quarterly and annual financial results may vary significantly depending on our customers\u2019 needs and shipping instructions. These fluctuations result in varying volumes and sales in given periods, which also reduces your ability to compare our financial results in different periods or in the same periods in different years.\nLoss of confidence in us by our customers, farmers and other suppliers, as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf our customers, farmers and other suppliers lose confidence in us as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases or for other reasons, they may seek to establish alternative commercial relationship. In addition, in such circumstances, our suppliers, farmers, vendors, counterparties and service providers to renegotiate the terms of our agreements, attempt to terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us. If our suppliers, farmers, vendors and other providers require stricter terms and conditions, we may not find these terms and conditions acceptable. Any failure to timely obtain suitable inventory at competitive prices could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nSuppliers who have historically grown tobacco and from whom we have purchased tobacco may elect to grow other crops instead of tobacco, which affects the world supply of tobacco and may impact our quarterly and annual financial performance.\nIncreases in the prices for other crops have led and may in the future lead suppliers who have historically grown tobacco, and from whom we have purchased tobacco, to elect to grow these other, more profitable, items instead of tobacco. A decrease in the volume of tobacco available for purchase may increase the purchase price of such tobacco. As a result, we could experience an increase in tobacco crop acquisition costs, which may impact our quarterly and annual financial performance.\nOur advancement of inputs to tobacco suppliers could expose us to losses.\nAdvances to tobacco suppliers are settled as part of the consideration paid upon the suppliers delivering us unprocessed tobacco at market prices. Two primary factors determine the market value of the tobacco suppliers deliver to us: the quantity of tobacco delivered and the quality of the tobacco delivered. Unsatisfactory quantities or quality of the tobacco delivered could result in losses with respect to advances to our tobacco suppliers or the deferral of those advances.\nWhen we purchase tobacco directly from suppliers, we bear the risk that the tobacco will not meet our customers\u2019 quality and quantity requirements.\nIn countries where we contract directly with tobacco suppliers, we bear the risk that the tobacco delivered will not meet quality and quantity requirements of our customers. If the tobacco does not meet such market requirements, we may not be able to sell the tobacco we agreed to buy and may not be able to meet all of our customers\u2019 orders, which would have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nWeather and other conditions can affect the marketability of our inventory.\nLike other agricultural products, the quality of tobacco is affected by weather and the environment, which can change the quality or size of the crop. If a weather event is particularly severe, such as a major drought or hurricane, the affected crop could be destroyed or damaged to an extent that it would be less desirable to our customers, which would result in a reduction in revenues. If such an event is also widespread, it could affect our ability to acquire the quantity of products required by customers. In addition, other items can affect the marketability of tobacco, including, among other things, the presence of:\n\u2022non-tobacco related material;\n\u2022genetically modified organisms; and\n\u2022excess residues of pesticides, fungicides and herbicides.\nA significant event impacting the condition or quality of a large amount of any of the tobacco crops we buy could make it difficult for us to sell such tobacco or to fill our customers\u2019 orders. In addition, in the event of climate change, adverse weather patterns could develop in the growing regions in which we purchase tobacco. Such adverse weather patterns could result in more permanent disruptions in the quality and size of the available crop, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe face increased risks of doing business due to the extent of our international operations.\nSome of the countries we do business in do not have stable economies or governments. Our international operations are subject to international business risks, including unsettled political conditions, uncertainty in the enforcement of legal obligations, including the collection of accounts receivable, fraud risks, expropriation, import and export restrictions, exchange controls, inflationary economies, currency risks, and risks related to the restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries. These risks are exacerbated in countries where we have advanced substantial sums or guaranteed local loans or lines of credit for the purchase of tobacco from suppliers. For example, in 2006 as a result of the political environment, economic instability, foreign currency controls, and governmental regulations in Zimbabwe, we deconsolidated our Zimbabwe subsidiary, Mashonaland Tobacco Company LTD (\"MTC\"). Subsequently, we determined that the significant doubt about our ability to control MTC was eliminated and reconsolidated MTC as of March 31, 2016. The Company utilizes the Zimbabwe RTGS system for local transactions. RTGS is a local currency equivalent that is exchanged at a government specified rate with USD. In order to convert these units to USD, the Company must obtain foreign currency resources from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, which are subject to the monetary and exchange control policy in Zimbabwe. If the foreign exchange restrictions and government-imposed controls become severe, we may have to reassess our ability to control MTC.\nOur international operations are in areas where the demand is for the export of lower priced tobacco. We have significant investments in our purchasing, processing and exporting operations in Argentina, Brazil, Malawi, Tanzania and Turkey.\nIn recent years, economic problems in certain countries where we have international operations have received wide publicity related to devaluation and appreciation of the local currency and inflation, including the classification of the Argentina, Malawi, and Zimbabwe economies as highly inflationary. Devaluation and appreciation of the local currency and inflation can affect our purchase costs of tobacco and our processing costs. In addition, we conduct business with suppliers and customers in countries that have recently had or may be subject to dramatic political regime change. In the event of such dramatic changes in the government of such countries, we may be unable to continue to operate our business, or adequately enforce legal obligations, after the change in a manner consistent with prior practice.\nFailure of foreign banks in which our subsidiaries deposit funds or the failure to transfer funds or honor withdrawals may affect our results of operations.\nFunds held by our foreign subsidiaries are often deposited in their local banks. In addition, we maintain deposit accounts with numerous financial institutions around the world in amounts that exceed applicable governmental deposit insurance levels. Banks in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to a higher rate of failure or may not honor withdrawals of deposited funds. In addition, the countries in which these local banks operate may lack sufficient regulatory oversight or suffer from\nstructural weaknesses in the local banking system. Due to uncertainties and risks relating to the political stability of certain foreign governments, these local banks also may be subject to exchange controls and therefore unable to perform transfers of certain currencies. If our ability to gain access to these funds was impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and we operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. We operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations. Although our corporate policy prohibits foreign bribery and we have adopted procedures to promote compliance, we cannot assure you that our policy or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA for actions taken by our agents, employees, and intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we acquire. Failure to comply with the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws) could lead to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures (including further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies, and controls, the imposition of a compliance monitor at our expense and potential personnel changes and/or disciplinary actions), any of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities also could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn 2010, we entered into settlements with the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve their investigations regarding potential criminal and civil violations of the FCPA. The settlements resulted in the disgorgement in profits and fines totaling $19.5 million, which have been paid. Both settlements also required us to retain an independent compliance monitor for a three-year term that was completed on September 30, 2013.\nOur exposure to foreign tax regimes, and changes in U.S. or foreign tax regimes, could adversely affect our business.\nWe do business in countries that have tax regimes in which the rules are not clear, are not consistently applied and are subject to sudden change. This is especially true with regard to international transfer pricing. Our earnings could be reduced by the uncertain and changing nature of these tax regimes. Certain of our subsidiaries are and may in the future be involved in tax matters in foreign countries. While the outcome of any of these existing matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we are vigorously defending them and do not currently expect that any of them will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. However, should one or more of these matters be resolved in a manner adverse to our current expectation, the effect on our results of operations for a particular fiscal reporting period could be material.\nWe seek to optimize our tax footprint across all operations in U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions alike. These benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and in the countries in which our international operations are located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe conduct our business in many countries around the world. Our business is generally conducted in USD, as is the business of the leaf tobacco industry as a whole. We generally must purchase tobacco in non-U.S. countries using local currency. As a result, local country operating costs, including the purchasing and processing costs for tobaccos, are subject to the effects of exchange fluctuations of the local currency against the USD. When the USD weakens against foreign currencies, our costs for purchasing and processing tobacco in such currencies increases. We attempt to minimize such currency risks by matching the timing of our working capital borrowing needs against the tobacco purchasing and processing funds requirements in the currency of the country where the tobacco is grown. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies can significantly affect our operating results.\nIn addition, the devaluation of foreign currencies has resulted and may in the future result in reduced purchasing power from customers whose capital resources are denominated in those currencies. We may incur a loss of business as a result of the devaluation of these currencies now or in the future.\nCompetition could erode our earnings.\nThe leaf tobacco industry is highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on the prices charged for products and services as well as the merchant\u2019s ability to meet customer specifications in the buying, processing, and financing of tobacco. In addition, there is competition in all countries to buy the available tobacco. The loss or substantial reduction of any large or significant customer could reduce our earnings.\nIn addition to the two primary global independent publicly held leaf tobacco merchants, the cigarette manufacturers increasingly buy tobacco directly from local and regional suppliers. We also face increasing competition from new local and\nregional independent leaf merchants with low fixed costs and overhead and good local customer connections, where the new entrants have been able to capitalize in the global transition to those markets. Any of these sources of new competition may result in less tobacco available for us to purchase and process in the applicable markets.\nRisks Related to Our E-liquids Businesses\nThe results of operations and financial position of our e-liquids businesses may differ materially from the expectations of the Company's management.\nDue to numerous uncertainties, the results of operations and financial position of our e-liquids businesses may differ materially from the expectations of the Company\u2019s management. The process for estimating the revenue, net income, and cash flow of these businesses requires the use of judgment in determining the appropriate assumptions and estimates. These estimates and assumptions may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. In addition, the assumptions used in planning may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the financial condition or results of operations of these businesses.\nAs the markets in which our e-liquids businesses compete continue to develop, competition from market participants may have a negative impact on their business and prospects.\nThe markets in which our e-liquids businesses compete are competitive and are expected to become increasingly competitive. Certain of these competitors have significantly greater financial, production, marketing, research and development, technical, and human resources than we do. The commercial opportunity for these businesses could be reduced or eliminated if their competitors produce and commercialize products that, among other things, are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive, have greater sales, marketing, and distribution support, enjoy enhanced timing of market introduction and perceived advantages of better quality and receive more favorable publicity. As a result, these competitors may be more successful in gaining market penetration and market share. If our e-liquids businesses do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance in their respective markets, they may not generate sufficient revenue from their products, and their businesses may not be profitable.\nTo remain competitive while complying with regulatory requirements, our e-liquids businesses will require continued significant investment in regulatory compliance, research and development, marketing, sales, and customer support. These businesses may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and customer support efforts on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nChanging consumer preferences may adversely affect consumer retention and results of operations.\nAs a result of changing consumer preferences, many novel products attain financial success for a limited period of time. Even if certain of our e-liquids products find retail success, we cannot assure you that any of these products will continue to see extended financial success. The success of our e-liquids businesses will be significantly dependent upon their ability to develop new and improved product lines and to adapt to consumer preferences. Even if we are successful in introducing new products or developing current products, a failure to gain consumer acceptance or to update products with compelling content could cause a decline in popularity of these products that could reduce revenues and harm the Company's e-liquids brands, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nConsumer perception and reputational risk may negatively affect our e-liquids businesses.\nThe respective markets for the products of our e-liquids businesses are highly dependent upon consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of their products. Consumer perception can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding the consumption of these products. We cannot assure you that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the these markets or any particular product, or consistent with currently held views. Future research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity that are perceived as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse effect on the respective industries and demand for the products of our e-liquids businesses, which could affect their businesses, results of operations and cash flows. This dependence upon consumer perception means that adverse scientific research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate or with merit, could have a material adverse effect on our e-liquids businesses and their respective business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, adverse publicity, reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of the vaping industry's products in general, or associating the consumption of these types of products with illness or other negative effects or events, could have a material adverse effect. Such adverse publicity reports or other media attention could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from consumers' failure to consume such products legally, appropriately, or as directed. Any litigation that might affect consumer perception regarding the products of our e-liquids businesses could take the form of class proceedings or individual proceedings.\nThere have been a number of highly publicized cases involving lung and other illness and deaths that appear to be related to vaporizer devices or products used in such devices. For example, in February 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported that federal and state agencies were investigating an outbreak of over 2,807 lung injury cases involving patients from all 50 states and one U.S. territory, including 68 confirmed deaths. As a result of the outbreak or future developments related to potential health risks associated with vaping, governments and private sector parties initiated actions aimed at reducing the incidence of vaping and/or seeking to hold manufacturers of nicotine e-liquids, and other vaping products, responsible for the adverse health effects associated with the use of vaping products. As there has been a limited period of time to study the long-term effects of vaporizer use, there is limited data on the safety and health effects. If scientific or medical research ultimately determines that use of vaporizer devices poses a significant risk to health or safety, the demand for vaporizer products may decrease, and regulation of these products could become significantly more restrictive. Certain states and local governments have already implemented regulations that prohibit the sale of vaporizers, the sale of flavored products (including nicotine, non-nicotine, e-liquid, e-cigarette and other vaping products) or have implemented additional restrictions on the composition of the product (e.g., maximum nicotine content restrictions). Additional states and localities may implement similar restrictions and the regulations may become more restrictive at the federal level. Additional or more restrictive regulatory changes may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActions by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) and other federal, state, or local governments or agencies may impact consumers\u2019 acceptance of or access to nicotine e-liquids, and other vaping products (for example, through product standards related to flavored products promulgated by the FDA), limit consumers\u2019 choices, delay or prevent the launch of new or modified products or products with claims of reduced risk, require the recall or other removal of products from the marketplace (for example, as a result of product contamination or regulations that ban certain flavors or ingredients), restrict communications to consumers, restrict the ability to differentiate products, create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain companies, impose additional manufacturing, labeling, or packaging requirements, interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business, or restrict or prevent the use of specified products in certain locations or the sale of products by certain retail establishments. Any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRestrictions on our ability to ship e-liquids products to consumers from online sales, including recently enacted prohibitions with respect to shipments through on the U.S. Postal Service, could materially adversely affect our e-liquids businesses.\nOn February 19, 2021, the USPS published its Proposed Regulations regarding the mailing of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, vaping device products, and e-liquids. The Proposed Regulations would subject e-cigarettes, vaping devices products, and e-liquid products to all existing restrictions on and exceptions for the mailing of cigarettes, except that the existing exceptions permitting the mailing of cigarettes (i) for consumer testing purposes and (ii) by federal agencies for public health purposes would not be available for the mailing of e-cigarettes, vaping devices products, and e-liquid products. If the Proposed Regulations were enacted as proposed by the USPS, subject to limited exceptions in applicable USPS regulations (including between legally operating businesses pursuant to applications approved by the USPS), shipment of these products via the USPS would be prohibited on and after the date on which the USPS promulgates the final regulations.\nWhile the USPS did not meet its deadline for issuing the final regulations, the Company expects publication of the final regulations in the second or third quarter of 2021, which would result in a general federal prohibition on the mailing of e-cigarettes and other vaping devices, as well as e-liquids products, by businesses to consumers. Any such shipments are subject to seizure, and the sender is subject to criminal fines, imprisonment, and civil penalties. It has generally been reported that certain private delivery services, such as United Parcel Service, DHL and FedEx, have voluntarily implemented similar prohibitions on the use of their services for the delivery of e-cigarettes and other vaping devices, as well as e-liquids products. In light of the amended PACT Act, described below, it is uncertain whether any other reliable private delivery service will undertake to deliver e-liquids products to consumers. Historically, a substantial portion of our e-liquids products are sold to consumers through online orders. Accordingly, our e-liquids businesses will be materially adversely affected by these prohibitions and other restrictions if we are unable to effect shipment of e-liquids products to consumers through reliable and efficient delivery services.\nOther provisions of the 2021 Appropriations Act significantly increase the federal regulation of the online sale of our e-liquids products, which may increase our costs and affect the competitiveness of our products as compared to those sold by local retailers, and violations of these regulations could expose us to significant penalties.\nProvisions of the 2021 Appropriations Act subject e-cigarettes and other vaping devices, as well as e-liquids products, to the provisions of the PACT Act, which imposes stringent rules on online sellers, including requirements for online retailers to register with the U.S. Attorney General, verify the age of customers using a commercially available database, collect an adult signature at the point of delivery, and collect all applicable local and state taxes, and affix any required tax stamps to the products sold. Sellers who do not register or do not comply with the shipping and reporting rules of the PACT Act are subject to civil and criminal penalties, including up to three years in prison. Accordingly, compliance with the requirements of the PACT Act may significantly increase the costs of our e-liquids online businesses, increasing the prices of our online products and\nmaking them less attractive to consumers as compared to products sold at local retailers. In addition, failure to comply with the PACT Act could expose us to significant penalties that could materially adversely affect our e-liquids businesses and our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are limited long-term data with respect to the efficacy and side effects of nicotine e-liquids products, and future studies may lead to conclusions that dispute or conflict with the Company's understanding and belief regarding the benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing and social acceptance of such products.\nIn particular, the rapid development of nicotine e-liquids and other vaping products has not provided sufficient time for the medical profession to study the long-term health effects of using such products. Therefore, it is uncertain as to whether or not nicotine e-liquids and other vaping products are safe for their intended use. If the medical profession were to determine that using nicotine e-liquids and other vaping products posed a significant threat to long-term human health, consumption could decline rapidly and we may be forced to modify our e-liquids and other vaping products. Such an outcome may have a material adverse effect on the Company's e-liquids businesses, and results of operations. In addition, these products could have unexpected side effects, the discovery of which could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur e-liquids businesses face inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action, and litigation if their products are alleged to have caused significant loss, injury, or death.\nAs manufacturers and distributors of products that are ingested or otherwise consumed by humans, our e-liquids businesses face the risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation (including class proceedings and individual proceedings) if their products are alleged to have caused loss, injury or death. They may be subject to these types of claims due to allegations that their products caused or contributed to injury, illness or death, made false, misleading or impermissible claims, failed to include adequate labelling and instructions for use or failed to include adequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of our e-liquids products alone or in combination with other medications or substances could also occur. In addition, the manufacture and sale of any ingested or consumable product involves a risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. Our e-liquids businesses may in the future have to recall certain of their products as a result of potential contamination and quality assurance concerns. A product liability claim or regulatory action against these businesses could result in increased costs and could adversely affect their reputation and goodwill with their consumers. We cannot assure you that product liability insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Such insurance is expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could result in the Company's becoming subject to significant liabilities that are uninsured and also could adversely affect commercial arrangements between our e-liquids businesses and third parties.\nThe risk of class-based litigation (and individual litigation) for manufacturers and distributors of e-liquids and other vaping products, and others involved in the vaping industry, is significant, particularly in the face of increasing health and marketing concerns, the potential for product recalls or other product-related issues. The United States has highly active plaintiffs\u2019 bar. Recent years have seen a number of purported class action lawsuits in the United States against manufacturers and distributors of e-liquids and other vaping products. These circumstances create enhanced risk and exposure for the Company given the nature of its operations, the products it manufactures, distributes and sells, and its business environment.\nThe Company could incur unexpected expenses due to product recalls and any legal proceedings that may arise in connection with product recalls.\nManufacturers and distributors of products are sometimes subject to the recall or return of their products for a variety of reasons, including product defects, such as contamination, unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances, packaging safety and inadequate or inaccurate labeling disclosure, or other alleged or actual regulatory compliance violations. If any of the Company's products, including our e-liquids businesses, are recalled due to an alleged product defect or for any other reason, the Company could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection with the recall. The Company may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin or at all. In addition, a product recall may require significant attention from management. Although the Company has detailed procedures in place for testing its products, we cannot assure you that any quality, potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen product recalls, regulatory action or lawsuits. Additionally, if one of the products produced by the Company were subject to recall, the image and reputation of that product and the Company as a whole could be harmed. A recall for any of the foregoing reasons could lead to decreased demand for the Company's products and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and reputation of the Company.\nAdditionally, product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of the Company's operations by applicable regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses.\nRisks Relating to the CCAA Proceedings\nCertain of the sales contemplated in the CCAA Proceeding remain subject to the satisfaction of conditions and may not occur, in which case we may be unable to recover funds advanced to the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries under the Canadian DIP Facility, and if such sales transactions occur the amount of recovery that the Company may receive with respect to its interests in the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries will depend on the amount of claims against the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries submitted in the CCAA Proceeding, the extent to which such claims are approved by the Canadian Court and the extent to which the Company\u2019s advancements with respect to Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries determined by the Canadian Court as debt claims entitled to recovery on the same basis as other unsecured creditor claims and, accordingly, Pyxus may incur additional impairments charges related to our investments in and advances to the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries, and Pyxus may be liable under its guarantees of obligations of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries to the extent that those obligations are not fully satisfied by the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries in the CCAA Proceeding.\nThe consummation of all of the contemplated sales with respect to the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, some of which have not yet been satisfied. In the event that conditions to the consummation of the respective sales are not satisfied, such sale transaction may not occur, and accordingly the anticipated sales with respect to the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries may not generate sufficient net proceeds to fund repayment in full of aggregate borrowings owed under the Canadian DIP Facility. Further, even if such sales transactions are completed as contemplated and borrowings under the Canadian DIP facility are repaid, the amount of any recovery that the Company may receive related to advancements with respect to the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries will depend on the amount of claims against the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries submitted in the CCAA Proceeding, the extent to which such claims are approved by the Canadian Court and the extent to which the Company\u2019s advancements with respect to Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries are determined by the Canadian Court to be debt claims entitled to recovery on the same basis as other unsecured creditor claims with respect to the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries. In the event that such advancements by the Company are not treated in the CCAA Proceedings as debt claims entitled to recovery on the same basis as other unsecured creditor claims Pyxus may not recover a substantial portion or any amounts with respect to such advancements. In such case, Pyxus may incur further impairment with respect to its advancements in respect to the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries. In addition, Pyxus has guaranteed certain obligations of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries, including office lease obligations and severance that may be owed to certain executives of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries. To the extent that such obligations are not satisfied by the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries, Pyxus may have liability under such guarantees. To the extent that consummation of the sales transactions contemplated in the CCAA Proceeding, or other aspects of the CCAA Proceeding, are delayed, borrowings of the Canadian Cannabis Subsidiaries under the Canadian DIP Facility may be greater than anticipated and exacerbate concerns with respect to our maintenance of necessary liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Other Aspects of Our Operations\nLow investment performance by our defined benefit pension plan assets may increase our pension expense, and may require us to fund a larger portion of our pension obligations, thus, diverting funds from other potential uses.\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover certain eligible employees. Our pension expense and required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure the defined benefit pension plan obligations.\nIf plan assets perform below the assumed rate of return used to determine pension expense, future pension expense will increase. Further, as a result of the global economic instability or other economic market events, our pension plan investment portfolio may experience significant volatility.\nThe proportion of pension assets to liabilities, which is called the funded status, determines the level of contribution to the plan that is required by law. In recent years, we have funded the plan in amounts as required, but changes in the plan\u2019s funded status related to the value of assets or liabilities could increase the amount required to be funded. We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further increase our pension funding obligations, diverting funds that would otherwise be available for other uses.\nWe rely on internal and externally hosted information technology systems and disruption, failure, or security breaches of these systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information technology (\"IT\") systems, including systems hosted by service providers. The enterprise resource planning system we have implemented throughout the Company, for example, is hosted by iTelligence and our domestic employee payroll system is hosted by Ceridian. Although we have disaster recovery plans and several intrusion preventive mitigating tools and services in place, which are active inline services or are tested routinely, our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems, including those hosted by service providers, may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control, such as catastrophic events, power outages,\nnatural disasters, computer system, or network failures, computer viruses or other malicious software programs, and cyber-attacks, including system hacking and other cyber-security breaches. For example, in April 2019, the Company discovered that the email accounts of two Canadian employees had been compromised resulting in the unauthorized access of customer and vendor data. These incidents were neither material nor compromised the Company\u2019s other IT systems. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation, and the loss of suppliers or customers. A significant disruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance and financial condition.\nWe cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future.\nIn certain prior years, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Although we intend to continue to aggressively monitor and improve our internal controls, we cannot assure you that other material weaknesses will not occur in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in misstatements in our financial statements in amounts that could be material. Ineffective internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock and could also require additional restatements of our prior reported financial information. In addition, because we are no longer an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d under applicable SEC regulations, we are no longer required to obtain and present a report of our independent accounting firm with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and we have not obtained such a report with respect to an evaluation of our internal controls as of March 31, 2021 and, accordingly, no such report is included in this Form 10-K.\nRegulations regarding environmental matters may affect the Company by substantially increasing the Company's costs and exposing it to potential liability.\nThe Company is subject to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which the Company operates. Such regulations govern, among other things, emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil, and groundwater contamination, and the health and safety of the Company's employees. For example, the Company's products and the raw materials used in its production processes are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. The Company may be required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of its current or proposed operations. The Company may not have been, nor may it be able to be at all times, in full compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, the Company could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.\nAs with other companies engaged in similar activities or that own or operate real property, the Company faces inherent risks of environmental liability at its current and historical production sites. Certain environmental laws impose strict and, in certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of the investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances as well as liability for related damages to natural resources. In addition, the Company may discover new facts or conditions that may change its expectations or be faced with changes in environmental laws or their enforcement that would increase its liabilities. Furthermore, its costs of complying with current and future environmental, health, and safety laws, or the Company's liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, regulated materials, may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDerivative transactions may expose us to potential losses and counterparty risk.\nWe may, from time to time, enter into certain derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts. Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges are reported as income, and accordingly could materially affect our reported income in any period. In addition, the counterparties to these derivative transactions may be financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we would be subject to risks that these counterparties default under these transactions. In some of these transactions, our exposure to counterparty credit risk may not be secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions over the last few years have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions, including bankruptcy. If one or more of the counterparties to one or more of our derivative transactions not secured by any collateral becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we would become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. We cannot assure you of the financial stability or viability of any of our counterparties.\nTo the extent that any of our indebtedness that extends beyond 2021 bears interest at rates based on LIBOR, the interest rates for these obligations might be subject to change based on recent regulatory changes.\nThe chief executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the benchmark administrator for USD LIBOR rates, proposed extending the publication of certain commonly used USD LIBOR settings until\nJune 30, 2023 and the FCA issued a statement supporting such proposal. In connection with this proposal, certain U.S. banking regulators issued guidance strongly encouraging banks to generally cease entering into new contracts referencing USD LIBOR as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, including when LIBOR will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the SOFR markets. The future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate applicable agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate that extend beyond the scheduled LIBOR termination dates to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established, which may have an adverse effect on our interest expense and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nCertain shareholders have the ability to exercise controlling influence on various corporate matters.\nUpon our emergence from Chapter 11, two shareholders and their respective affiliates, Glendon Capital Management LP (together with its affiliates, the \u201cGlendon Investor\u201d) and Monarch Alternative Capital LP (together with its affiliates, the \u201cMonarch Investor\u201d; the Glendon Investor and the Monarch Investor are together referred to as the \u201cSignificant Shareholders\u201d) beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 56% of our issued and outstanding common stock and, therefore, have significant control on the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, including, but not limited to, electing directors and approving corporate transactions. Pursuant to the terms of a Shareholders Agreement dated as of August 24, 2020 among the Company and certain shareholders, including the Significant Shareholders, each of the Glendon Investor and the Monarch Investor has the right (depending on its continued ownership of a specified percentage of the outstanding shares of our common stock) to nominate up to two individuals for election as directors, and each of them and the other shareholders that are parties to the Shareholders Agreement have agreed to take all necessary action to elect such nominees as directors. Under our articles of incorporation, the affirmative vote of each of the Glendon Investor and the Monarch Investor, so long as it continues to maintain an Investor Percentage Interest (as defined in the Shareholders Agreement) of at least five percent, is required for the approval of any amendment to the articles of incorporation. It is our understanding that each of the Glendon Investor and the Monarch Investor hold a significant amount of the Notes and the Term Loans. In addition, the Glendon Investor and the Monarch Investor are the lenders under the DDTL Facility. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of the Significant Shareholders could be in conflict with the interests of other shareholders, and the Significant Shareholders could have substantial influence to cause us to take actions that align with their interests. Should conflicts arise, we can provide no assurance that the Significant Shareholders would act in the best interests of other shareholders or that any conflicts of interest would be resolved in a manner favorable to our other shareholders.\nThe price of our common stock may be negatively impacted by factors that are unrelated to our operations.\nAlthough our common stock is currently listed for quotation on the OTC Markets, we understand that no securities brokerage firm is making a market in the Company\u2019s common stock. Trading through the OTC Markets is frequently thin and may be highly volatile. There is no assurance that a sufficient market will continue in our stock, in which case it could be difficult for shareholders to sell their stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of the markets in which our businesses operate, quarterly operating results of our competitors, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.\nOur actual financial results may vary significantly from the projections that were filed with the Bankruptcy Court.\nCertain projected financial information was included in the disclosure statement relating to the Plan filed with the Bankruptcy Court to support the feasibility of the Plan and our ability to continue operations upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases. This projected financial information was prepared by, and is the responsibility of, our management. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance and with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results may vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the Chapter 11 Cases and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, such projections are now stale and should no longer be relied upon as a forecast of expected results.\nRisks Relating to the Tobacco Industry\nReductions in demand for consumer tobacco products could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe tobacco industry, both in the United States and abroad, continues to face a number of issues that may reduce the consumption of cigarettes and adversely affect our business, sales volume, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThese issues, some of which are more fully discussed below, include:\n\u2022governmental actions seeking to ascribe to tobacco product manufacturers liability for adverse health effects associated with smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke;\n\u2022smoking and health litigation against tobacco product manufacturers;\n\u2022increased consumer acceptance of electronic cigarettes;\n\u2022tax increases on consumer tobacco products;\n\u2022potential prohibition on the sale of menthol cigarettes in the United States;\n\u2022current and potential actions by state attorneys general to enforce the terms of the Master Settlement Agreement, or MSA, between state governments in the United States and tobacco product manufacturers;\n\u2022governmental and private bans and restrictions on smoking;\n\u2022actual and proposed price controls and restrictions on imports in certain jurisdictions outside the United States;\n\u2022restrictions on tobacco product manufacturing, marketing, advertising and sales;\n\u2022the diminishing social acceptance of smoking;\n\u2022increased pressure from anti-smoking groups;\n\u2022other tobacco product legislation that may be considered by Congress, the states, municipalities and other countries; and\n\u2022the impact of consolidation among multinational cigarette manufacturers.\nLegislation and regulatory and other governmental initiatives could impose burdensome restrictions on the tobacco industry and reduce consumption of consumer tobacco products and demand for our services.\nThe Tobacco Control Act, which amended the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, extends the authority of the FDA to regulate tobacco products. This act authorizes the FDA to adopt product standards for tobacco products, including the level of nicotine yield and the reduction or elimination of other constituents of the products, along with provisions for the testing of products against these standards. The act imposes further restrictions on advertising of tobacco products, authorizes the FDA to limit the sales of tobacco products to face-to-face transactions permitting the verification of the age of the purchaser, authorizes a study to determine whether the minimum age for the purchase of tobacco products should be increased and requires submission of reports from manufacturers of tobacco products to the FDA regarding product ingredients and other matters, including reports on health, toxicological, behavioral, or physiologic effects of tobacco products and their constituents. The act also mandates warning labels and requires packaging to indicate the percentage of domestically grown tobacco and foreign grown tobacco included in the product, although the FDA has issued guidance to the industry announcing its intent to enforce the latter requirements until further notice. The FDA has adopted regulations under the act establishing requirements for the sale, distribution, and marketing of cigarettes, as well as package warnings and advertising limitations.\nThe act directs the FDA to promulgate regulations requiring that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, preproduction design validation, packing, and storage of a tobacco product conform to current good manufacturing practice. Regulations under the act do not apply to tobacco leaf that is not in the possession of a manufacturer of tobacco products, or to the producers of tobacco leaf, including tobacco suppliers, tobacco warehouses, and tobacco supplier cooperatives unless those entities are controlled by a tobacco product manufacturer, but do apply to our U.S. cut rag processing facility with respect to covered tobacco products.\nIn May 2016, the FDA finalized regulations, which became effective in August 2016, that extend its regulatory authority under the act to tobacco products not previously covered by its regulations, including vaporizers, vape pens, hookah pens, electronic cigarettes (or, e-cigarettes), e-pipes, and other types of electronic nicotine delivery systems, including e-liquids used in these devices, as well as pipe tobacco and cigars (including little cigars and cigarillos), and future novel tobacco products. These regulations require manufacturers of these additional tobacco products to, among other things submit an application and obtain FDA authorization to market a new tobacco product (as noted above); register establishment(s) and submit product listing to FDA; submit listing of ingredients; submit information on harmful and potentially harmful constituents; submit tobacco health documents; not introduce into interstate commerce modified-risk tobacco products (e.g., products with label, labeling, or advertising representing that they reduce risk or are less harmful compared to other tobacco products on the market) without an FDA order; and include the required warning statement on packaging and advertisements. These regulations apply to certain of our operations that had not previously been subject to the act, including the processing of pipe tobacco and tobacco for little cigars and cigarillos at our U.S. cut rag processing facility, and to joint ventures and subsidiaries that develop, produce and sell consumable e-liquids. In addition, the May 2016 regulations make these additional tobacco products subject to certain existing restrictions on the sale of cigarettes, including then-existing restrictions prohibiting sale to individuals under 18 years of age. In addition, recent federal legislation established a national minimum purchase age of 21 for tobacco and tobacco-based products, including e-liquids.\nThe full impact of the act, including the May 2016 regulations and any future regulatory action to implement the act, is uncertain. However, if the effect of the act and FDA regulations under the act is a significant reduction in consumption of\ntobacco products, it could materially adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOn April 28, 2021, the FDA announced its intention to propose regulations that would ban the sale of menthol flavored cigarettes in the United States. It is uncertain whether any such regulations will be proposed or adopted. If such regulations are adopted, consumption of tobacco products in the United States could be materially reduced. Such a reduction could adversely impact customer demand for our leaf tobacco products, which could materially adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nReports with respect to the harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking have been publicized for many years, and the sale, promotion and use of cigarettes continue to be subject to increasing governmental regulation. Since 1964, the Surgeon General of the United States and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have released a number of reports linking cigarette smoking with a broad range of health hazards, including various types of cancer, coronary heart disease and chronic lung disease, and recommending various governmental measures to reduce the incidence of smoking. More recent reports focus upon the addictive nature of cigarettes, the effects of smoking cessation, the decrease in smoking in the United States, the economic and regulatory aspects of smoking in the Western Hemisphere, and cigarette smoking by adolescents, particularly the addictive nature of cigarette smoking in adolescence. Numerous state and municipal governments have taken and others may take actions to diminish the social acceptance of smoking of tobacco products, including banning smoking in certain public and private locations.\nA number of foreign nations also have taken steps to restrict or prohibit cigarette advertising and promotion, to increase taxes on cigarettes and to discourage cigarette smoking. In some cases, such restrictions are more onerous than those in the United States. For example, advertising and promotion of cigarettes has been banned or severely restricted for a number of years in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, Singapore and other countries. Further, in February 2005, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) treaty, the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (\u201cFCTC\u201d), entered into force. This treaty, which the WHO reports has been signed by 182 nations as of March 31, 2021, requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would require, among other things, specific actions to prevent youth smoking; restrict or prohibit tobacco product marketing; inform the public about the health consequences of smoking and the benefits of quitting; regulate the content of tobacco products; impose new package warning requirements including the use of pictorial or graphic images; eliminate cigarette smuggling and counterfeit cigarettes; restrict smoking in public places; increase and harmonize cigarette excise taxes; abolish duty-free tobacco sales; and permit and encourage litigation against tobacco product manufacturers.\nDue to the present regulatory and legislative environment, a substantial risk exists that tobacco product sales may decline. A significant decrease in worldwide tobacco consumption brought about by existing or future governmental laws and regulations would reduce demand for tobacco products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nGovernment actions can have a significant effect on the sourcing of tobacco. If some of the current efforts are successful, we could have difficulty obtaining sufficient tobacco to meet our customers\u2019 requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our performance and results of operations.\nThe WHO, through the FCTC, created a formal study group to identify and assess crop diversification initiatives and alternatives to leaf tobacco growing in countries whose economies depend upon tobacco production. In its initial report published in 2007, the study group indicated that the FCTC did not aim to phase out tobacco growing, but the study group's focus on alternatives to tobacco crops was in preparation for its anticipated eventual decrease in demand resulting from the FCTC's other tobacco control initiatives.\nIf the objective of the FCTC study group were to change to seek to eliminate or significantly reduce leaf tobacco production and certain countries were to partner with the study group in pursuing this objective, we could encounter difficulty in sourcing leaf tobacco to fill customer requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues, including climate change, conservation, and natural resource management, could result in new or more stringent forms of regulatory oversight of industry activities, which may lead to increased levels of expenditures for environmental controls, land use restrictions affecting us or our suppliers, and other conditions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, certain aspects of our business generate carbon emissions. Regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions have been proposed in certain countries in which we operate. These may include limitations on such emissions, taxes or emission allowance fees on such emissions, various restrictions on industrial operations, and other measures that could affect land-use decisions, the cost of agricultural production, and the cost and means of processing and transporting our products. These actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to governmental investigations into, and litigation concerning, leaf tobacco industry buying and other payment practices.\nThe leaf tobacco industry, from time to time, has been the subject of government investigations regarding trade practices. For example, we were the subject of an investigation by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice into certain buying practices alleged to have occurred in the industry, we were named defendants in an antitrust class action litigation alleging a conspiracy to rig bids in the tobacco auction markets, and we were the subject of an administrative investigation into certain tobacco buying and selling practices alleged to have occurred within the leaf tobacco industry in some countries within the European Union, including Spain, Italy, Greece and potentially other countries.", "PERMNO": 29867, "SIC": 5190, "TIC": "PYXSQ"}
