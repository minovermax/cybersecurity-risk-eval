RISK FACTORS\nWe describe below the material risks that management believes affect or could affect us. Understanding these risks is important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report and to evaluating an investment in our common stock.\nAn investment in a financial institution such as First Choice Bancorp involves significant risks. These risks derive primarily from the financial institutions industry, the nature of the way financial institutions operate, and the national economy, generally, and, more specifically, from our operations, financial condition, local economy, competition and similar factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties, together with all other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before you make any decision regarding an investment in our common stock. You should also consider the information set forth above under \u201cCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.\u201d The risks described below are not the only risks facing our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be impaired. This Annual Report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nOur future success is based in large part on the accuracy of our assumptions about and inherent in our business, marketing and growth strategies for the Company, as well as our ability to identify and implement strategies to address the risks identified herein. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could significantly decline, and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nOur business is adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions.\nU.S. economic conditions affect our operating results generally, and the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay the principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business and economic conditions in the markets in which\nwe operate and in the United States as a whole. Such factors include the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, deflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity of the global financial markets, availability and cost of capital and credit, investor sentiment and confidence in financial markets, and sustainability of economic growth. The deterioration of any of these conditions could adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses, including credit quality concerns related to repayment ability and collateral protection as well as reduced demand for the products and services we offer, our securities, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, our capital levels and liquidity, and our results of operations. In recent years there has been gradual improvement in the U.S. economy as evidenced by a rebound in the housing market, lower unemployment and higher equities markets; however, economic growth has been uneven, and opinions vary on the strength and direction of the economy. Uncertainties also have arisen regarding the potential for a reversal or renegotiation of international trade agreements and the overall effects of recent comprehensive tax reform under the administration of U.S. President Donald J. Trump, and the impact such actions and other policies of the administration may have on economic and market conditions. In addition, concerns about the performance of international economies, especially in Europe and emerging markets, and economic conditions in Asia, particularly the economies of China and Taiwan, can impact the economy and financial markets here in the United States. These economic pressures on consumers and businesses may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nThe United States economy has been in a slow-paced nine-year expansion since the Great Recession ended in 2009. This current expansion has been longer than most U.S. expansionary periods in recent history, increasing the probability of a near-term U.S. economic recession. An economic recession adversely affects our operating results because we experience higher loan and lease charge-offs and higher operating costs. Global economic conditions also affect our operating results because global economic conditions directly influence the U.S. economic conditions. Various market conditions also affect our operating results. Real estate market conditions directly affect performance of our loans secured by real estate. Debt markets affect the availability of credit which impacts the rates and terms at which we offer loans and leases. Stock market downturns affect businesses\u2019 ability to raise capital and invest in business expansion. Stock market downturns often signal broader economic deterioration and/or a downward trend in business earnings which adversely affects businesses\u2019 ability to service their debts.\nIn particular, we may face the following risks in connection with the events described above. An economic recession or a downturn in various markets could have one or more of the following adverse effects on our business:\n\u2022\na decrease in the credit quality of our borrowers and the demand for our loans and leases and other products and services offered by us;\n\u2022\na decrease in our deposit balances due to overall reductions in the accounts of customers;\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of our investment securities and loans;\n\u2022\nan increase in the level of nonperforming and classified loans;\n\u2022\nan increase in provisions for loan losses and loan charge-offs;\n\u2022\nan increase in adverse asset values and an overall material adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio;\n\u2022\na decrease in net interest income derived from our lending and deposit gathering activities;\n\u2022\na decrease in our stock price;\n\u2022\nan increase in our operating expenses associated with attending to the effects of the above-listed circumstances;\n\u2022\na decrease in real estate values or a general decrease in capital available to finance real estate transactions could have a negative impact on borrowers\u2019 ability to pay off their loans at maturity;\n\u2022\nthe banking industry remains heavily regulated despite the adoption of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act in May 2018, and changes by Congress or federal regulatory agencies to the banking and financial institution regulatory regime and heightened legal standards and regulatory requirements may continue to be adopted in the future. Compliance with such regulations may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nthe process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including qualitative factors that pertain to economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. The level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the process.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk, and variations in interest rates may materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nChanges in the interest rate environment may affect our earnings and net interest income. It is expected that we will continue to realize income from the differential or \u201cspread\u201d between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-\nearning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including competition, federal economic monetary and fiscal policies, and general economic conditions, such changes in market interest rates could affect (i) loan volume, (ii) fair value of our securities portfolio, (iii) loan yields, (iv) funding sources, and (v) funding costs.\nThe Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest rates may increase our loan yield, it may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers with variable-rate loans to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations. This could result in additional delinquencies or charge-offs and negatively impact our results of operations. Following an increase in interest rates, our ability to maintain a positive net interest spread is dependent on our ability to increase our loan offering rates, replace loan maturities with new originations, minimize increases on our deposit rates, and maintain an acceptable level and mix of funding. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to increase our loan offering rates and continue to originate loans due to the competitive landscape in which we operate. Additionally, we cannot provide assurances that we can minimize the increases in our deposit rates while maintaining an acceptable level and mix of deposits. Finally, we cannot provide any assurances that we can maintain our current levels of noninterest-bearing deposits as customers may seek higher-yielding products with the continued increase in deposit rates.\nAccordingly, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, net interest margin, cost of funding sources, asset quality, loan origination volume, liquidity, and overall profitability.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could harm our business.\nOur operations consist of offering banking services to generate both interest and noninterest income. Many of our competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking and related financial services within our market areas. These competitors include national banks, regional banks and other community banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan institutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have opened loan production offices or otherwise solicit deposits in our market areas. Additionally, we face growing competition from so-called \u201conline businesses\u201d with few or no physical locations, including online banks, lenders and consumer and commercial lending platforms, as well as automated retirement and investment service providers. Increased competition in our markets may result in reduced loans, deposits and commissions and brokers\u2019 fees, as well as reduced net interest margin and profitability. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to continue to grow our business, and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks\u2019 reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure in or breach of our operations, security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses, and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity, as well as cause reputational harm.\nThe potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and from our interactions with third parties. Our operations, security systems and infrastructure, including our computer systems, network infrastructure, data management and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. In addition, we rely on our employees and third parties in our ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error or malfeasance or failure or\nbreach of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. We have taken measures to implement backup systems and safeguards to support our operations, security systems and infrastructure, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to the third parties with whom we interact. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating or security systems, and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or may become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide certain services. There could be electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, disease pandemics, or events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts. We continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth, and this entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and liquidity, and may result in loss of confidence, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation.\nA cyber-attack, information or security breach, or a technology failure of ours or of a third-party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or manage our exposure to risk, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, increase our costs to maintain and update our operations, security systems or infrastructure, and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity, as well as cause reputational harm.\nWe offer various internet-based services to its clients, including online banking services. The secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential in maintaining our clients\u2019 confidence in our online services. In addition, our business is highly dependent on the security and safety of our infrastructure, computer and data management systems, as well as those of third parties with whom we interact. Cyber security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunication technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states and other external parties. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computers, data management systems and networks, and in the computers, data management systems and networks of third parties. We rely heavily on digital technologies, computers, databases and email systems, software and networks. Notwithstanding our defensive systems and processes that are designed to prevent security breaches and periodically test our security, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective, especially as the threat from cyber-attacks is continuous and severe, attacks are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Failure to mitigate breaches of security could result in violations of applicable privacy laws, reputational damage, regulatory fines, litigation exposure, and increased security compliance costs, all of which could adversely affect our ability to offer and grow our online services and, in turn, have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that have resulted in any material system failure, incident or security breach to date. However, a cyber-attack, information or security breach or a technology failure of ours or of a third-party could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity, as well as cause reputational harm.\nFailure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry experiences continuous technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will safely and effectively satisfy customer demands, while at the same time create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors, however, have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, we depend on internal and outsourced technology to support all aspects of our business operations. Interruption or failure of these systems creates a risk of business loss as a result of adverse customer experiences and possible diminishing of our reputation, damage claims or civil fines. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry or to successfully convert to a new core processing system could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nOur concentration of loans to privately owned small- and medium-sized companies and our concentration of lending to particular market sectors and industries could expose us to greater lending risk if the privately owned small- or medium-sized company, market sector or industry were to experience economic difficulties or changes in the regulatory environment.\nOur portfolio consists primarily of real estate and commercial loans to small- and medium-sized privately owned businesses in a limited number of industries throughout Southern California, with the largest concentrations in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, and San Diego counties, where we have our branches and loan production offices. Loans made to these types of clients entail higher risks than loans and leases made to larger, publicly owned firms that are able to access a broader array of credit sources and thus more easily weather an economic downturn.\nMost of our real property collateral is located in Southern California. In the past, there has been a significant decline in real estate values in many parts of California, including certain parts of our service area. If the area were to experience such declines in value again, the collateral for our loans may provide less security than when the loans were originated. A decline in values could have an adverse impact on us by limiting repayment of defaulted loans through the sale of commercial and residential real estate collateral and by a likely increase in the number of defaulted loans to the extent that the financial condition of our borrowers is adversely affected by such a decline in values. The adverse effects of the foregoing matters upon our real estate portfolio could necessitate a material increase in our provision for loan losses.\nIf any particular industry or market sector were to experience economic difficulties, especially if those economic difficulties were to occur in the counties where our loans are concentrated, the overall timing and amount of collections on our loans to clients operating in those industries and in that geography may differ from what we expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nReal estate construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate, and we may be exposed to significant losses on loans for these projects.\nThe risks inherent in real estate construction loans may affect adversely our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such risks include, among other things, (i) the possibility that contractors may fail to complete, or complete on an untimely basis, construction of the relevant properties; (ii) substantial cost overruns in excess of original estimates and financing are incurred; (iii) market deterioration occurs during construction; and (iv) a lack of permanent take-out financing arises. Loans secured by such properties also involve additional risk because they have no operating history. The costs may exceed a project's realizable value in a declining real estate market and such properties may not be sold or leased so as to generate the cash flow anticipated by the borrower. Real estate construction loans, including land development loans, comprised approximately 15% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018.\nBecause of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the realizable market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated or market values or rental rates decline, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default, we may not be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time while we attempt to dispose of it. A general decline in real estate sales and prices across the United States or locally in the relevant real estate market, a decline in demand for commercial real estate loans, economic weakness, high rates of unemployment, and reduced availability of mortgage credit, are some of the factors that can adversely affect the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their obligations to us and the value of our security interest in collateral, and thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and could result in further losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our nonperforming assets, excluding PCI loans, are defined as nonperforming loans (defined as accruing loans past due 90 days or more, non-accrual loans and nonperforming troubled-debt restructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d)) plus real estate acquired through foreclosure, totaled $1.7 million, or 0.14% of our gross loans held for investment portfolio, or 0.11% of total assets. We did not have any other real estate owned (\"OREO) at December 31, 2018. In addition, we had $484 thousand in accruing loans that were 30-89 days delinquent at December 31, 2018.\nOur nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans, thereby adversely affecting our net income and returns on assets and equity, as well as increasing our loan administration costs and adversely affecting our efficiency ratio. When we take collateral in foreclosure and similar\nproceedings, we are required to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value, which may result in a loss. These nonperforming loans and OREO also increase our risk profile and the level of capital our regulators believe is appropriate for us to maintain in light of such risks. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management and can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. If we experience increases in nonperforming assets, our net interest income may be negatively impacted and our loan administration costs could increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not effectively manage our credit risk, we may experience increased levels of delinquencies, nonperforming loans and charge-offs, which could require increases in our provision for loan losses.\nThere are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service debt and risks resulting from changes in economic and market conditions. We cannot guarantee that our credit underwriting and monitoring procedures will reduce these credit risks, and they cannot be expected to completely eliminate our credit risks. If the overall economic climate in the United States, generally, or our market areas, specifically, declines, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision for loan losses, which would cause our net income, return on equity and capital to decrease.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe establish our allowance for loan losses and maintain it at a level that management considers adequate to absorb probable loan losses based on an analysis of our portfolio and market environment. The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon relevant information available to us. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships, as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. Additions to the allowance for loan losses, which are charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses, are determined based on a variety of factors, including an analysis of the loan portfolio, historical loss experience and an evaluation of current economic conditions in our market areas. The actual amount of loan losses is affected by changes in economic, operating and other conditions within our markets, which may be beyond our control, and such losses may exceed current estimates. Any deterioration in the real estate market generally and in the commercial real estate and residential building segments in particular could result in additional loan charge-offs and provisions for loan losses in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, net income and capital.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.88% and as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was 642.0%. Although management believes that the allowance for loan losses, as well as the unamortized fair value discount of loans acquired, is adequate to absorb losses on any existing loans that may become uncollectible, we may be required to take additional provisions for loan losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for loan losses, either due to management\u2019s decision to do so or because our banking regulators require us to do so. Our bank regulatory agencies will periodically review our allowance for loan losses and the value attributed to nonaccrual loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure and may require us to adjust our determination of the value for these items. These adjustments may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe current expected credit loss standard established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board will require significant data requirements and changes to methodologies.\nIn the aftermath of the Great Recession that ended in 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") reviewed how banks estimate losses in their allowance for loan losses calculation, and it issued the final Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, standard on June 16, 2016. Currently, the impairment model used by financial institutions is based on incurred losses, and loans are recognized as impaired when there is no longer an assumption that future cash flows will be collected in full under the originally contracted terms. This model will be replaced by the CECL model that will become effective for us for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019 in which financial institutions will be required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable forecasts to estimate the expected loss over the life of the loan. The CECL model will materially impact how we determine our allowance for loan losses and may require us to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses. Furthermore, we may experience more fluctuations in our allowance for loan and lease losses, which may be significant. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to increase our allowance for loan losses as a result of the implementation of CECL. If we were required to materially increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, it may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are currently evaluating the new guidance and expect it to have an impact on our statements of operations and financial condition, the significance of which is\nnot yet known. We expect the CECL model will require us to recognize a one-time cumulative adjustment to our allowance for loan and lease losses on January 1, 2020 in order to fully transition from the incurred loss model to the CECL.\nDeposit are an important source of funds for our continued growth and profitability.\nOur business strategy calls for continued growth. Our ability to continue to grow depends in part on our ability to successfully attract deposits to fund loan growth. Core deposits are a low cost and stable source of funding and a significant source of funds for our lending activities. Our inability to retain or attract such funds could adversely affect our liquidity. If we are forced to seek other sources of funds, such as additional brokered deposits or borrowings from the FHLB, the interest expense associated with these other funding sources may be higher than the rates we are currently paying on our deposits, which would adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur deposit portfolio includes significant concentrations and a large percentage of our deposits are attributable to a relatively small number of clients.\nAs a commercial bank, we provide services to a number of clients whose deposit levels vary considerably and have a significant amount of seasonality. At December 31, 2018, approximately 47% of our total deposits, or $584.9 million, related to 69 clients who maintained balances in excess of $2 million each. This includes our ten largest depositor relationships which accounted for approximately 25% of our total deposits and our single largest depositor relationship which accounted for 8% of our deposits at December 31, 2018. These deposits can and do fluctuate substantially. The loss of any combination of these depositors, or a significant decline in the deposit balances due to ordinary course fluctuations related to these customers\u2019 businesses, would adversely affect our liquidity and require us to raise deposit rates to attract new deposits, purchase federal funds or borrow funds on a short-term basis to replace such deposits. Depending on the interest rate environment and competitive factors, low cost deposits may need to be replaced with higher cost funding, resulting in a decrease in net interest income and net income. While these events could have a material impact on our results, we expect, in the ordinary course of business, that these deposits will fluctuate and believe we are capable of mitigating this risk, as well as the risk of losing one of these depositors, through additional liquidity, and business generation in the future. However, should a significant number of these customers leave us, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to liquidity risk, and a failure to maintain sufficient liquidity could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. Although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet commitments under various economic conditions, an inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of investment securities and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market disruption, a decrease in the borrowing capacity assigned to our pledged assets by our secured creditors, or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry generally as a result of conditions faced by banking organizations in the domestic and worldwide credit markets.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy standards, and a failure to meet these standards could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe U.S. federal bank regulators have jointly adopted new capital requirements on banks and bank holding companies as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, which became effective on January 1, 2015, incorporate the elements of Basel Committee\u2019s Basel III accords and have the effect of raising our capital requirements and imposing new capital requirements beyond those previously required. Increased regulatory capital requirements (and the associated compliance costs) whether due to the adoption of new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations, or more expansive or aggressive interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require us to raise additional capital, or impact our ability to pay dividends or pay compensation to our executives, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of our common stock. If we do not meet minimum capital requirements, we will be subject to prompt corrective action by federal bank regulatory agencies. Prompt corrective action can include progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions. For additional discussion regarding our capital requirements, please refer to Item 1. Business - Regulation and Supervision - Capital Adequacy Requirements.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our periodic operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022\ncyber security breaches;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional stockholders;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nproposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u2022\nanticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us; or\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks, has experienced significant volatility during the past several years and the future performance of the stock market is inherently uncertain. As a result, the stock market generally and the market price and trading volume of our common stock specifically may be volatile. The trading price of our common stock will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including, without limitation, our financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects, and future sales of our equity or equity-related securities. A significant decline in our stock price could result in the potential impairment of goodwill, substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.\nThe primary source of the holding company's liquidity from which, among other things, we pay dividends will be the receipt of dividends from the Bank and a credit line secured by a lien on 100% of the Bank's common stock.\nThe holding company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and/or the DBO could assert that payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the holding company, it is likely that, in turn, there would be insufficient capital or cash to make any cash distributions to our shareholders in the form of cash dividends or share repurchases and we may have difficulty meeting other financial obligations, including payments in respect of any outstanding indebtedness or subordinated debentures, if any at the time. Although at December 31, 2018, the Bank had retained earnings of $24.1 million, we can provide no assurances that the Bank\u2019s future operating results would not reduce the Bank\u2019s retained earnings or regulatory required capital ratios to a level that would be insufficient to pay dividends to the holding company or would otherwise require prior regulatory approval to do so. The inability of the Bank to pay dividends to the holding company could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and market price of our common stock.\nIn order to provide additional liquidity and flexibility for us to operate, we have arranged a $25 million advancing line of credit from a correspondent bank. That line of credit is secured by 100% of the Bank's common stock. The line of credit also has covenants which must be met before we can make further advances. Failure to meet these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may reduce or discontinue the payment of dividends on common stock.\nOur stockholders are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is subject to the restrictions set forth in California law and by the Federal Reserve. As a \u201csmall bank holding company\u201d under applicable Federal Reserve regulations, we are prohibited from paying cash dividends at any time that our debt to equity ratio is greater than 1.0:1 and until such time as our debt to equity ratio is equal to or less than 1.0:1 and the\nBank is well-capitalized. In addition, we may be restricted by applicable laws or regulations or actions taken by our regulators, now or in the future, from paying dividends to our stockholders. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue paying dividends on our common stock at current levels or at all. A reduction or discontinuance of dividends on our common stock could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our shareholders.\nProvisions of our charter and bylaws and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our stockholders. The combination of these provisions effectively inhibits a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board of Directors.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provided for sweeping regulatory changes and the establishment of strengthened capital and liquidity requirements for banks and bank holding companies, including minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements no less than the strictest requirements in effect for depository institutions as of the date of enactment; the requirement that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength for their depository institution subsidiaries; enhanced regulation of financial markets, including the derivative and securitization markets, and the elimination of certain proprietary trading activities by banks; additional corporate governance and executive compensation requirements; enhanced financial institution safety and soundness regulations; revisions in FDIC insurance assessment fees; the implementation of the qualified mortgage and ability-to-repay rules for mortgage loans; and the establishment of new regulatory bodies, such as the CFPB and the Financial Services Oversight Counsel, to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation. Although legislation has been introduced to reduce regulatory requirements, including the Tax Act described above and the regulatory relief act described below, compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations has and will continue to result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, other new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the bank and non-bank financial services industries and impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Certain aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities, require more oversight or change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and to file reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. We are required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements. The federal banking agencies and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts against banks and other financial services providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including any future acquisition plans.\nFailure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, growth prospects and reputation.\nWe may become subject to supervisory action by bank supervisory authorities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the value of our common stock.\nUnder federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of financial institutions, the Federal Reserve has authority over the Bancorp and the Bank, and in addition the DBO and FDIC have authority over the Bank. All of these respective regulatory authorities may compel or restrict certain actions if the Bancorp or the Bank should violate any laws or regulations, if their capital should fall below adequate capital standards as a result of operating losses, or if these regulators otherwise determine that the Bancorp or the Bank engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, including failure to exercise proper risk oversight over the many areas of the Bancorp\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s operations. These regulators also have authority over the Bancorp\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s compliance with various statutes and consumer protection and other regulations. Among other matters, the corrective actions that may be required of the Bancorp or the Bank following the occurrence of any of the foregoing may include, but are not limited to, requiring the Bancorp and/or the Bank to enter into informal or formal enforcement orders, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements, supervisory letters, commitment letters, and consent or cease and desist orders to take corrective action and refrain from unsafe and unsound practices; removing officers and directors; assessing civil monetary penalties; and taking possession of, closing and liquidating the Bank. If we are unable to meet the requirements of any corrective actions, we could become subject to supervisory action. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of our common stock.\nWe are subject to the CRA, fair lending and other laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to material penalties.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending and other requirements on financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies, including the FDIC and CFPB, are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA, fair lending and other compliance laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. The costs of defending, and any adverse outcome from, any such challenge could damage our reputation or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success.\nOur employees are our most important resource. Competition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the banking industry is intense, which means the cost of hiring, incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase. We endeavor to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees. Our senior management team has significant industry experience, and their knowledge and relationships would be difficult to replace. In addition, we continue to recruit qualified individuals to succeed existing key personnel to ensure the growth and successful operation of our business. If for any reason we are unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, our performance, including our competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, to attract and retain personnel with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business, we may offer a variety of benefits, which could reduce our earnings or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough we have non-solicitation agreements with certain of our executive officers, which limits the ability of such executives to solicit our customers and employees if they leave our employment, our ability to enforce such agreements may not fully mitigate the injury to our business from the breach of such agreements, as such employees could leave us and immediately begin soliciting our customers. In addition, the departure of any of our personnel who are not subject to enforceable non-competition agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe may incur significant losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risks, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, legal and compliance risk, strategic risk, information security risk, and reputational risk. We are also reliant upon our employees, and our operations are subject to the risk of fraud, theft or malfeasance by our employees. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational and compliance systems, and internal control and management review processes. However, these systems and review processes and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and, as a result, we\nmay not anticipate every economic and financial outcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes, particularly in the event of the kinds of dislocations in market conditions experienced during the recession, which highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. If those systems and review processes prove to be ineffective in identifying and managing risks, our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of our common stock, and our reputation could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have engaged in expansion through an acquisition and may consider additional acquisitions in the future, which could negatively affect our business and earnings.\nWe have engaged in expansion through an acquisition of PCB in 2018 and may consider other acquisitions in the future. There are risks associated with any such expansion. These risks include, among others, incorrectly assessing the asset quality of a bank acquired in a particular transaction, encountering greater than anticipated costs in integrating acquired businesses, facing resistance from customers or employees, and being unable to profitably deploy assets acquired in the transaction. To the extent we issue capital stock in connection with additional transactions, if any, these transactions and related stock issuances may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and share ownership.\nOur earnings, financial condition, and prospects after a merger or acquisition depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired company. We may be unable to integrate operations successfully or to achieve expected cost savings. Any cost savings which are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings. As with any acquisition of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause us to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from us and move their business to competing financial institutions.\nIn addition, our ability to grow may be limited if we cannot make acquisitions. We compete with other financial institutions with respect to proposed acquisitions. We cannot predict if or when we will be able to identify and attract acquisition candidates or make acquisitions on favorable terms.\nWe may experience goodwill impairment.\nGoodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized but is reviewed at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. If our estimates of goodwill fair value change, we may determine that impairment charges are necessary. Estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons. If management\u2019s estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate, the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment may not be recognized in a timely manner. No assurance can be given that we will not record an impairment loss on goodwill in the future and any such impairment loss could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to claims and litigation which could adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, or cause us significant reputational harm.\nWe and certain of our directors, officers and subsidiaries may be involved, from time to time, in reviews, investigations, litigation, and other proceedings pertaining to our business activities. If claims or legal actions, whether founded or unfounded, are not resolved in a favorable manner to us, they may result in significant financial liability. Although we establish accruals for legal matters when and as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and certain expenses and liabilities in connection with such matters may be covered by insurance, the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued and/or insured. Substantial legal liability could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nLiabilities from environmental regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clear up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of any contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages, and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events could harm our business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant negative impact on our ability to conduct business. The nature and level of severe weather and/or natural disasters cannot be predicted and may be exacerbated by global climate change. Severe weather and natural disasters could harm our operations through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our computer systems, which could prevent or impede us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling the flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. California, in which our business is located and a substantial portion of our loan collateral is located, is susceptible to severe weather and natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, droughts and wildfires. Additionally, the United States remains a target for potential acts of war or terrorism. Such severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events could negatively impact our business operations or the stability of our deposit base, cause significant property damage, adversely impact the values of collateral securing our loans and/or interrupt our borrowers\u2019 abilities to conduct their business in a manner to support their debt obligations, which could result in losses and increased provisions for loan losses. There is no assurance that our business continuity and disaster recovery program can adequately mitigate the risks of such business disruptions and interruptions.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. These losses or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Additionally, if our competitors were extending credit on terms we found to pose excessive risks, or at interest rates which we believed did not warrant the credit exposure, we may not be able to maintain our business volume and could experience deteriorating financial performance.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a public company, we will be required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. In particular, we will be required to certify our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act beginning with our second annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which will require us to furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Although we are currently an emerging growth company and have elected additional transitional relief available to emerging growth companies, if we are unable to continue to qualify as an emerging growth company in the future or we are unable to qualify as a smaller reporting company under applicable SEC rules, then our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nIf we identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting once we are no longer an emerging growth company, investors, counterparties and customers may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our consolidated financial statements and reports; our liquidity, access to capital markets and perceptions of our creditworthiness could be adversely affected; and the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, the DBO or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. These events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as described in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are otherwise generally\napplicable to public companies. These include, without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial reporting requirements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments. The JOBS Act also permits an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. However, we have irrevocably \u201copted out\u201d of this provision, and we will comply with new or revised accounting standards to the same extent that compliance is required for non-emerging growth companies.\nWe have elected to take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements relating to executive compensation and the number of years of financial information presented, and in the future we may take advantage of any or all of these exemptions for so long as we remain an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more, (ii) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering which would be December 31, 2023, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt, and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we rely on the exemptions, which may result in a less active trading market and increased volatility in our stock price.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the FASB or SEC, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Such changes may result in us being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators or outside auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in our needing to revise or restate prior period consolidated financial statements.", "PERMNO": 17798, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FCBP"}
