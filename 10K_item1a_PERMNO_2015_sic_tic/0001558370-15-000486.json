In evaluating us, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors, as well as other risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common or preferred stock. See \u201cCautionary Note about Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for additional risks and information regarding forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business\nWe cannot control the future price of natural gas and sustained low prices could hurt our profitability, financial condition and the borrowing base available under our credit facility, and could impair our ability to grow or to satisfy fixed payment obligations on our indebtedness.\nNatural gas comprised approximately 98% of our total production for the year ended December 31, 2014 and represented 98% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2014. Our revenues, profitability, liquidity, future rate of growth, the borrowing base under our credit facility and the carrying value of our properties depend heavily on prevailing prices for natural gas. Historically, natural gas prices have been highly volatile, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States, and in the past several years have been particularly influenced by significant changes in weather and total domestic natural gas supplies. Prices have also been affected by actions of federal, state and local governments and agencies, foreign governments, national and international economic and political conditions, levels of consumer demand, weather conditions, domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, and the price and availability of alternative fuels. In addition, sales of natural gas are seasonal in nature, leading to substantial differences in cash flow at various times throughout the year. These external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to estimate future prices of natural gas. Any substantial or extended decline in the price of natural gas would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including reduced cash flow and borrowing capacity, and lower proved reserves. Price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on potential acquisitions and development and exploration projects, and sustained lower gas prices may cause us or the operators of properties in which we have ownership interests to curtail some projects and drilling activity. Because we are significantly leveraged, a substantial decrease in our revenue as a result of lower commodity prices could impair our ability to satisfy payment obligations on our indebtedness or pay our preferred stock dividends, and our funds available for operations and future business opportunities will be reduced by that portion of our cash flow required to make such payments.\nAvailability under our bank credit facility depends on a borrowing base, which is subject to redetermination by our lenders. If our borrowing base is reduced, we may be required to repay amounts outstanding under the credit facility.\nOur credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow based on the borrowing base amount, as determined by our lenders. Our lenders determine our borrowing base using several factors, which include the calculated value of our proved reserves using commodity pricing assumptions as determined by the lenders, with effect given to our derivative positions. Our lenders can adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the credit facility. Our credit facility provides for semi-annual borrowing based redeterminations on April 1 and October 1. As a result of the lower commodity prices, it is likely that our borrowing base will be reduced at the next redetermination date. Any downward adjustment of the borrowing base in excess of the then outstanding borrowings would require that we repay such difference. If we experience a reduction in our borrowing base as result of a redetermination, any required repayments would reduce our liquidity and would likely impact our ability to fund future capital spending, our ability to maintain our current facilities or our ability to make future dividend payments on our Series A Preferred Stock. Any significant borrowing base reduction may require us to sell certain assets in order to meet the associated repayment requirements.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has indicated that our financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, our independent registered public accounting firm has included in its audit opinion for the year ended December 31, 2014, a statement that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The inclusion of the going concern paragraph in the independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s audit opinion triggers an event of default under our credit facility. Although we are working to obtain a waiver from our lenders, it has not been received as of the date of this Form 10-K, and therefore our lenders could elect to declare all principal and interest outstanding to be due and payable. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain such waiver. The reaction of investors to the inclusion of a going concern statement by our auditors, our current lack of cash resources and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our common and preferred share prices and our ability to obtain additional financing or new capital.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our credit facility, there could be a default under the terms of the credit agreement, which could result in an acceleration of payment of borrowings and would impact our ability to maintain our current operations, increase our reserves, and/ or pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock.\nUnder our credit facility, we are subject to both financial and non-financial covenants. The financial covenants, as defined in the credit agreement, include maintaining (i) a current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0; (ii) a ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, exploration and other non-cash items (\u201cEBITDAX\u201d) to interest plus dividends of greater than 1.5 to 1.0; and (iii) a funded debt to EBITDAX ratio of less than 4.0 to 1.0. Covenant restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, may require us to sell assets or take other actions to reduce indebtedness to meet our covenants, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted.\nAs a result of the current price environment and our depleting asset base, it is likely that we will be unable to meet the funded debt to EBITDAX ratio required in the credit agreement in future periods, including the first quarter of 2015. We are working with our bank to obtain a waiver or to modify the covenant structure in our credit agreement. If we are not able to meet the covenant, or any other financial or non-financial covenants, and we are unable to negotiate a waiver or amendment thereof, the lenders would have the right to declare an event of default, terminate the remaining commitment and accelerate payment of all principal and interest outstanding. In the event that we become non-compliant with any financial or non-financial covenant under our credit facility, we cannot provide assurance that we will be granted waivers or amendments to our credit agreement if for any reason we are unable to comply with the agreement, or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur existing capital structure may impede our ability to raise additional financial resources.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising additional financial resources to meet our current cash needs, and ultimately, to acquire and develop our natural gas and oil properties. Our existing capital structure includes 1,610,000 outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, which rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, priority of payment and liquidation premiums. As a result, it may be challenging for us to raise additional capital through the issuance of our common stock. Among other things, we may need to propose amendments to certain key financial terms of the articles supplementary for our Series A Preferred Stock in order to improve our ability to raise additional capital to meet our current cash needs, and ultimately, to identify and complete acquisitions and to resume our development efforts.\nOur significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $47,515 drawn under our bank credit facility, in addition to our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, which requires payment of cumulative cash dividends at a rate of 9.25% per year on the outstanding stated amount of $37,972.\nOur indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including;\n\u00b7\na significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes;\n\u00b7\nthe covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and future indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock and our common stock, make certain investments and may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;\n\u00b7\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; and\n\u00b7\nadditional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants.\nIn addition, we may incur additional debt in order to fund our exploration, development and acquisition activities. A higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that our liquidity may become impaired and we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future financial performance. General economic conditions, natural gas and oil prices and financial, business and other factors will affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt.\nPlease see also the risk factor Common stockholders may be diluted due to the conversion of our preferred stock or future sale for additional risks associated with our Series A Preferred Stock.\nWe do not control all of our operations and development projects.\nA significant amount of our business is conducted through operating agreements under which we own partial interests in oil and natural gas wells. If we do not operate the wells in which we own an interest, we do not have control over normal operating procedures, expenditures or future development of the underlying properties. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, or an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements, could reduce our production and revenues. The success and timing of drilling and development activities on properties operated by others depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator\u2019s:\n\u00b7\ntiming and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nexpertise and financial resources;\n\u00b7\ninclusion of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u00b7\nuse of technology\nSince we typically have a majority ownership interest in most of the wells that we do not operate, we may not be in a position to remove the operator in the event of poor performance.\nThe federal exploratory agreement governing our Spyglass Hill Unit states that a minimum of 25 wells must be drilled by September of each year, or the unit will be terminated. If the Spyglass Hill Unit were to terminate, any undeveloped federal lease acreage at that time would be extended for two years and if it remains undeveloped (at the end of the two year period), such leases in the unit will expire. Any undeveloped acreage located on state or fee leases would immediately expire upon termination of the unit. As a result, we would lose our opportunity to drill and produce new wells on any expired leases. It may also inhibit our ability to utilize gathering and transportation systems that are located\noutside the contracted PA. The Unit operator, Warren Resources Co. (\u201cWarren\u201d), announced in January of 2015 that given the current economic conditions, it does not plan to drill additional wells in 2015. To date, nine of the 25 wells have been drilled to satisfy the 2015 requirement. The unit operating agreement governing the Spyglass Hill Unit requires well drilling proposals to be approved by a majority of the working interest owners. Warren owns a majority interest in the field, and therefore drilling is ultimately at its discretion. At December 31, 2014, we had 5.3 Bcf of proved undeveloped located within the Spyglass Hill Unit; however, all of these reserves are located within the boundaries of the current PA.\nThe exploration, development and operation of oil and gas properties involve substantial risks that may result in a total loss of investment.\nExploring for and, to a lesser extent, developing and operating oil and gas properties involve a high degree of business and financial risk, and thus a substantial risk of loss of investment. We may drill wells that are unproductive or, although productive, do not produce oil and/or natural gas in sufficient quantities to cover the associated drilling, operating and other costs. Acquisition and completion decisions generally are based on subjective judgments and assumptions that are often speculative. We cannot predict with certainty the production potential of a particular property or well. Furthermore, the successful completion of a well does not ensure a profitable return on the investment. There are a variety of geological, operational, mechanical and market-related factors that may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well or otherwise prevent a property or well from being profitable. These include:\n\u00b7\nunusual or unexpected drilling conditions and geological formations;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions;\n\u00b7\nequipment failures or accidents; and\n\u00b7\nshortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs, equipment or experienced personnel.\nOur operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We have spent, and will continue to need to spend a substantial amount of capital for the acquisition, exploration, exploitation, development and production of natural gas and oil reserves. We have historically addressed our short and long-term liquidity needs through the use of cash flow provided by operating activities, borrowing under bank credit facilities, and the issuance of equity. Without adequate capital we may not be able to successfully execute our operating strategy. The availability of these sources of capital will depend upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nnatural gas and oil prices;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and financial market conditions;\n\u00b7\nour proved reserves and borrowing base;\n\u00b7\nour current capital structure;\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u00b7\nglobal credit and securities markets; and\n\u00b7\nour market value and operating performance.\nIf low natural gas prices, lack of adequate gathering or transportation facilities, operating difficulties or other factors, many of which are beyond our control, cause our revenues and cash flows from operating activities to decrease, we may be limited in our ability to obtain the capital necessary to complete our capital expenditures program.\nWe may have to drill additional water disposal wells to ensure we are in compliance with existing laws.\nWe are currently evaluating our water disposal process within certain acreage in the Catalina Unit to ensure we are in compliance with existing laws. As a result of our evaluation, we may need to drill up to two additional water disposals\nwells during 2015 at an anticipated cost to us in the range of $1.5-$4 million. Failure to comply with these laws may result in fines and other penalties.\nUnless we replace our natural gas and oil reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProducing natural gas and oil reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless we acquire properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities, or both, our proved reserves, production and revenues will decline over time. There are no assurances that we will be able to find, develop or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs, or at all.\nWe may be unable to develop our existing acreage due to the environmental and political pressures around natural resource development.\nOur planned expenditures are based upon the assumption that existing leases and regulations will remain intact and allow for the future development of carbon-based fuels. However, the United States federal government has not adopted a clear energy policy, and policy decisions continue to be complicated by the political situation in Washington D.C. Our ability to develop known and unknown reserves in areas in which we have reserves or leases may be limited, thereby limiting our ability to grow and generate cash flows from operations.\nThe largest portion of our anticipated growth and planned capital expenditures is expected to be from properties located in the Atlantic Rim that are covered by the Atlantic Rim Environmental Impact Study (\u201cEIS\u201d). In May 2007, the final Record of Decision for the Atlantic Rim EIS was issued, which allowed us and other operators in the area to pursue additional coalbed methane drilling. Three separate coalitions of conservation groups appealed the approval of the EIS to the Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d). All of the appeals were subsequently dismissed. Although the appeals were dismissed, the BLM does allow public comment during the permitting process. In October 2012, the National Wildlife Federation and Wyoming Wildlife Federation filed an appeal with the Interior Board of Land Appeals (\u201cIBLA\u201d) regarding the Finding of No Significant Impact (\u201cFONSI\u201d) and Decision Record for the development plan and certain drilling permits that have been issued in an undeveloped area of the Catalina Unit. The BLM issues a FONSI upon completion of an environmental impact assessment related to permit applications. The appeal asserts that BLM did not consider new environmental information when issuing the FONSI. The IBLA concluded that the environmental groups have sufficient support to pursue their claim in the federal court system. At this time the outcome of this appeal and its impact on future permits in the Atlantic Rim is uncertain. Appeals and public and private pressure from conservation and environmental groups could ultimately delay or prevent drilling in this area.\nOur operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.\nOur operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations such as those related to:\n\u00b7\nhydraulic fracturing\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on production\n\u00b7\npermitting\n\u00b7\nchanges in taxes\n\u00b7\ndeductions\n\u00b7\nroyalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies\n\u00b7\nprice or gathering-rate controls, and\n\u00b7\nenvironmental protection regulations\nIn order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and/or subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws or regulations, including environmental and tax laws, and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws or regulations become applicable to our operations. For example, currently proposed federal legislation and regulation, that, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, include legislation and regulation related to hydraulic fracturing, derivatives, and environmental regulations, which are each discussed below.\n\u00b7\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions and could reduce the amount of natural gas and oil we can produce. Hydraulic fracturing is a well completion process that involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas and oil production. We believe the use of hydraulic fracturing is necessary to produce commercial quantities of natural gas and oil from many reservoirs, including the CBM wells in the Atlantic Rim. Currently, regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements, although local initiatives have been proposed to further regulate or ban the process. Concerns about the exploration and development of shale gas using hydraulic fracturing has continued to grow, which may give rise to additional legislation or regulation in this area. Concerns about potential drinking water contamination has led the U.S. Congress to consider legislation to amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d) to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. The EPA, asserting its authority under the SDWA, issued a draft guidance that proposes to require facilities to obtain permits when using diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing operations. The guidance outlines requirements for diesel fuels used for hydraulic fracturing of wells, technical recommendations for permitting those wells, and a description of diesel fuels for EPA underground injection control permitting. The EPA is also conducting a wide-ranging study on the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water that may lead to additional regulations. The EPA released a progress report in December 2012 and final results were expected in 2014, although they have not yet been released. In May 2012, the U.S. Department of the Interior released draft regulations governing hydraulic fracturing to require the disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process, advance approval for well-stimulation activities, mechanical integrity testing of casing, and monitoring of well-stimulation operations on federal and Indian oil and gas leases. In Wyoming, where we conduct substantially all of our operations, we are now required to provide detailed information about wells we hydraulically fracture. Any other federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing activities and thereby affect our determination of whether a well is commercially viable. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements or operational restrictions, and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs. We conduct hydraulic fracturing operations on most of our wells, and therefore, restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities.\n\u00b7\nFederal legislation may decrease our ability, and increase the cost, to enter into hedging transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act passed in July 2010 expanded federal regulation of certain financial derivative instruments, including commodity derivatives. One such requirement of the regulation is that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges. The Act provides for an exception from these clearing requirements for commercial end-users, such as the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act may, however, require the posting of cash collateral for uncleared swaps and may limit trading in certain oil and gas related derivative contracts by imposing position limits. The rulemaking and implementation process is ongoing, and the ultimate effect of the adopted rules and regulations and any future rules and regulations on our business remains uncertain. As a result of the new regulations, the cost to hedge may increase as a result of fewer counterparties in the market and the pass-through of increased capital costs of bank subsidiaries. Decreasing our ability to enter into hedging transactions would expose us to additional risks related to commodity price volatility and impair our ability to have certainty with respect to a portion of our cash flow.\n\u00b7\nVarious federal and state government organizations are considering enacting new legislation and regulations governing or restricting the emission of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHG\u201d). The U.S. federal government has adopted, and other jurisdictions are considering legislation, regulations or policies that seek to control or reduce the production, use or emissions of GHG, to control or reduce the production or consumption of fossil fuels, and to increase the use of renewable or alternative energy sources. The EPA has begun to regulate certain GHG emissions from both stationary and mobile sources. The uncertain outcome and timing of existing and proposed international, national and state measures make it difficult to predict their business impact. However, we could face risks of project execution, higher costs and taxes and lower demand for and restrictions on the use of our products as a result of ongoing GHG reduction efforts. In addition to various proposed state regulations, at the federal level, the EPA regulates the level of ozone in ambient air and may propose to lower the allowed level of ozone in the future. Because of climate processes, most of the Rockies, where we operate, have naturally high levels of ozone. As a result of these existing and possible more stringent standards, we may not be able to obtain permits necessary to construct and operate new facilities, or, if we obtain the permits, the added costs to comply with the permit requirements could substantially increase our operating expenses, which would reduce our profits or make certain operations uneconomical.\nWe may incur more taxes and certain of our projects may become uneconomic if certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development are eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nThe current administration has proposed eliminating certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions and credits currently available to natural gas and oil exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties;\n\u00b7\nthe elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs;\n\u00b7\nthe elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities; and\n\u00b7\nan extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.\nIt is unclear whether any of the foregoing changes, or similar change, will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective. Any such changes could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations by increasing the costs of exploration and development of natural gas or oil resources, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe shortage or high cost of equipment, personnel and other oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.\nOur industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of equipment, qualified personnel, and oil field services. Regardless of the economic conditions, competition for experienced technical and other professional personnel remains strong. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected.\nAlso, as part of our business strategy, we rely on oil field service groups for a number of services, including drilling, cementing and hydraulic fracturing. Due to the increasing activity and attractiveness of the shale opportunities across the United States, there is increased competition for qualified and experienced crews in the Rocky Mountain region.\nNatural gas and oil drilling and production operations can be hazardous and expose us to liabilities.\nThe exploration, development and operation of oil and gas properties involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, hole collapse, pipe failure, abnormally pressured formations, natural disasters, vandalism, and environmental hazards, including gas and oil leaks, pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. These industry-related operating risks can result in injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, and suspension of operations which could result in substantial losses.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above. This insurance may not be adequate to cover losses or liabilities. Also, we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\nHydraulic fracturing may expose us to operational and financial risks.\nOur hydraulic fracturing operations subject us to operational and financial risks inherent in the drilling and production of oil and natural gas, including relating to underground migration or surface spillage due to uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, formation water or well fluids, as well as any related surface or ground water contamination, including from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives. Ineffective containment of surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination resulting from our hydraulic fracturing operations, including from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives, could result in environmental pollution, remediation expenses and third party claims alleging damages, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to find reliable and economic markets for our gas production.\nAll of our current natural gas production is produced in the Rocky Mountain region, and there is a limited amount of transportation volume availability for all of the area producers. Although there are numerous transportation pipeline projects, we cannot predict whether these new pipelines will add enough capacity in the future. We have contracts with marketing companies that provide for the availability of transportation for our natural gas, but interruption of any transportation line out of the Rocky Mountains could have a material impact on our financial condition.\nIn addition, the transportation providers have gas quality requirements, including Btu content, and carbon dioxide content. The gas we produce in the Catalina Unit is transported on the Southern Star Transportation line, which has various gas quality requirements, including that gas must have carbon dioxide content below 1%. We are currently in compliance with this requirement; however, in certain prior years our carbon dioxide exceeded this limit. If this recurs, and we are unable to obtain a waiver, we may incur additional costs to process this gas, or we may experience a production interruption at certain wells, which could have a material adverse impact on our cash flow and results of operations.\nAcquisitions are a part of our strategy, and we may not be able to identify, acquire, or integrate acquisitions successfully.\nIn recent years there has been intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry, and this environment can be particularly challenging for a company of our size with our limited resources. Our ability to identify and complete acquisitions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing, which is significantly constrained at present due to our existing debt levels, and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. Our ability to pursue an acquisition strategy will be hindered if we are not able to obtain financing or regulatory approvals on economically attractive terms, or at all. Additionally, competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions.\nWe could be subject to significant liabilities related to acquisitions. The successful acquisition of producing and non-producing properties requires an assessment of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include recoverable reserves, future oil and gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, title issues and other factors. It generally is not feasible to review in detail every individual property included in an acquisition. Ordinarily, a review is focused on higher valued properties. Further, even a detailed review of all properties and records may not reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not always inspect every well we acquire, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is performed. We cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits or synergies of a transaction.\nAcquisitions also often pose integration risks and difficulties. In connection with future acquisitions, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, and may\nrequire significant management attention and financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Acquisitions could result in us incurring additional debt, contingent liabilities and expenses, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nWe operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. We face intense competition from both major integrated energy companies and other independent oil and natural gas companies, many of which have resources substantially greater than ours. We compete in each of the following areas:\n\u00b7\nseeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration;\n\u00b7\nseeking to acquire or merge with desirable companies or business;\n\u00b7\nseeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to develop and operate our properties; and\n\u00b7\nretention and hiring of skilled employees.\nOur competitors may be able to pay more for development prospects, productive oil and natural gas properties, or other companies and businesses, and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties, prospects and companies than our financial or human resources permit. There is also growing pressure for companies to balance their oil to natural gas reserve ratios, primarily due to the decline in natural gas prices. This may further increase competition, particularly in the emerging shale plays. Our ability to develop and exploit our oil and natural gas properties and to acquire additional properties or companies in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations, evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.\nSubstantially all of our producing properties are located in the Rocky Mountains, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nOur operations have been focused on the Rocky Mountain region, which means our current producing properties and new drilling opportunities are geographically concentrated in that area. Because our operations are not as diversified geographically as many of our competitors, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of any regional events, including fluctuations in prices of natural gas and oil produced from the wells in the region, natural disasters, restrictive governmental regulations, transportation capacity constraints, weather, curtailment of production or interruption of transportation, and any resulting delays or interruptions of production from existing or planned new wells.\nOur reserves and future net revenues may differ significantly from our estimates.\nThis Form 10-K contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and estimated future net revenues from proved reserves. The estimates of reserves and future net revenues are not exact and are based on many variable and uncertain factors, including assumptions required by the SEC related to oil and gas prices, operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, drilling plans and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those estimated. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and the value of our reserves. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe present value, discounted at 10%, of the pre-tax future net cash flows attributable to our net proved reserves included in this Form 10-K should not be considered as the market value of our natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the present value, discounted at 10%, of the pre-tax future net cash flows attributable to our net proved reserves on the average oil and natural gas prices during the 12-month period before the ending date of the period covered by this Form 10-K, determined as an unweighted, arithmetic average of the first-day-of- the-month price for each month within such period, adjusted for quality and transportation. The assumed costs to produce the reserves remain constant at the costs prevailing on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than those used in the present value calculation. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which SEC rules require us to use in calculating our discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital from time to time and the risks associated with our business.\nBeginning in the second half of 2014, natural gas and oil commodity prices decreased substantially as compared to prices during the first half of 2014, and pricing has continued to decline through the first quarter of 2015. Assuming that these prices do not recover during the remainder of 2015, we would expect significant negative revisions to our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves based upon this low pricing environment. Such depressed natural gas prices, if experienced throughout the majority of 2015, could potentially result in impairment charges after we estimate the 2015 year-end discounted future net cash flows from our proved properties and compare them with their net book value. Further, the low natural gas and oil prices will affect the economic feasibility of developing our proved undeveloped reserves, and will also likely limit the amount of capital resources we have at our disposal to develop our proved undeveloped reserves, including borrowing capacity, if any, that could be drawn on our existing credit facility. These circumstances may lead to the reclassification of our resources from proved undeveloped reserves to unproved, which could have material adverse implications for the value of our company, cash flows, access to capital, liquidity and financial condition.\nSeasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in the Rocky Mountains are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations designed to protect various wildlife. In certain areas on federal lands, drilling and other oil and natural gas activities can only be conducted during limited times of the year. This limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those times for drilling rigs, oil field equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs.\nOur hedging activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income.\nTo achieve a more predictable cash flow, reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil, and meet the requirements of our existing credit facility, we currently, and will likely in the future, enter into hedging arrangements for a portion of our production revenues. While the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements, it also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements and expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including when there is a widening of the expected price differential between the delivery point of our production and the delivery points assumed in our hedge transactions, or the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contractual obligations.\nA default by any of our counterparties, which are generally financial institutions or major energy companies, could have an adverse impact on our ability to fund our planned activities or could result in a larger percentage of our production being subject to commodity price changes. In our hedging arrangements, we use master agreements that allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be \u201cnet settled\u201d at the time of election. \u201cNet settlement\u201d refers to a process by which all transactions between counterparties are resolved into a single amount owed by one party to the other.\nWe are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables.\nWe are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint interest billing hedging activity and other receivables. In 2014, we sold approximately 90% of our natural gas volumes and crude oil to one counterparty, which may impact our overall credit risk. We monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties on an ongoing basis. However, disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity, and it may be unable to satisfy its obligations to us. We are unable to predict sudden changes in financial market conditions or a counterparty\u2019s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nNasdaq has stock market listing standards for share prices and market capitalization, and failure to comply with the standards may result in the Company\u2019s common stock being de-listed from Nasdaq.\nOn January 20, 2015, we received notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department indicating that our common stock is subject to potential delisting from the Nasdaq because our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for 30 consecutive days. We have been provided 180 calendar days, or until July 20, 2015, to regain this compliance. If we fail to regain compliance before July 20, 2015, but meet all of the other applicable standards for initial listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market with the exception of the minimum bid price rule, then we may be eligible to have an additional 180 calendar days, or until January 17, 2016, to regain compliance. If our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the price of our common stock may decrease further and our ability to secure additional financing through the issuance and sale of equity could be adversely affected. In addition, upon such delisting and if we were not able to list our common stock on another recognized stock exchange, our common stock would be considered a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Broker-dealers desiring to make transactions in penny stocks have to comply with the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules. These requirements would also likely adversely affect the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock.\nIn the event that we continue to not pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, our common stockholders may be diluted due to potential future payment of preferred stock dividends in shares of our common stock.\nWe recently suspended the dividend payment on our Series A Preferred Stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. In the event that we are not able to, or do not, pay this dividend for a total of six quarters (whether consecutive or non-consecutive), we may have to pay a portion, or all, of accumulated and unpaid dividends in shares of our common stock. The issuance of common shares necessary to satisfy accumulated and unpaid dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock will dilute the ownership of our then existing common shareholders.\nThe trading volatility and price of our common stock may be affected by many factors.\nIn addition to our operating results and business prospects, many other factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock. Key factors, some of which are outside our control, include the following:\n\u00b7\nliquidity of our common stock, which is partially influenced by the total number of shares outstanding, as compared to the number of shares of common stock outstanding for other public companies in our peer group;\n\u00b7\ntrading activity in our common stock, which can be a reflection of changes in the prices for oil and natural gas, or market commentary sentiment, or expectations about our business and our overall industry; and\n\u00b7\ngovernmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence U.S. financial markets, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business.\nFailure of our common stock to trade at reasonable prices and volumes may limit our ability to fund future potential capital needs through issuances or sales of our stock.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Maryland law could delay or prevent a change of control of the Company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur amended articles of incorporation and Third Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that may make a change of control of the Company difficult, even if it may be beneficial to our stockholders. Such provisions include the authorization given to our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock and limitations on stockholders\u2019 ability to fill Board of Directors vacancies, remove directors, or vote by written consent.\nIn addition, as a Maryland corporation, we are subject to the provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law. Maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions can occur. These provisions contained in Maryland law may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us even if the acquisition would be advantageous to our stockholders. The Company believes these provisions would not apply to mergers and acquisitions that are approved by the Board of Directors and stockholders.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Series A Preferred Stock.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock ranks junior to all of our indebtedness and other liabilities and is effectively junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nIn the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our business, our assets available to pay obligations on the Series A Preferred Stock will be available only after all of our indebtedness and other liabilities have been paid. The rights of holders of our Series A Preferred Stock to participate in the distribution of our assets will rank junior to the prior claims of our current and future creditors and any future series or class of preferred stock we may issue that ranks senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. As of the date hereof, 1,610,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, having a liquidation value of $25 per share plus accumulated but unpaid dividends, are outstanding. If we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on any or all of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding. We have incurred and may in the future incur substantial amounts of debt and other obligations that will rank senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. At March 31, 2015, we had $47,515 of indebtedness under our credit facility, ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. Our credit facility prohibits payments of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock if we fail to comply with certain financial covenants or, at certain times, if a default or event of default has occurred. Certain of our other existing or future debt instruments may restrict the authorization, payment or setting apart of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.\nFuture offerings of debt or senior equity securities may adversely affect the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock. If we decide to issue debt or senior equity securities in the future, it is possible that these securities will be governed by an indenture or other instruments containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of the Series A Preferred Stock and may result in dilution to owners of the Series A Preferred Stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will bear the risk of our future offerings, reducing the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock and diluting the value of their holdings in us.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends in cash on the Series A Preferred Stock.\nWe suspended payment of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. We may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in the future. Our ability to pay dividends may be impaired if any of the risks described in this Form 10-K, were to occur. In addition, payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot make assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our Series A Preferred Stock, or to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock has not been rated.\nWe have not sought to obtain a rating for the Series A Preferred Stock. No assurance can be given, however, that one or more rating agencies might not independently determine to issue such a rating or that such a rating, if issued, would not adversely affect the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, we may elect in the future to obtain a rating for the Series A Preferred Stock, which could adversely affect the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock. Ratings only reflect the views of the rating agency or agencies issuing the ratings, and such ratings could be revised downward, placed on a watch list or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision, placing on a watch list, or withdrawal of a rating could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nCertain provisions governing our Series A Preferred Stock may preclude us from taking important actions.\nFollowing a change of ownership or control other than a change of ownership or control (a) involving a Qualifying Public Company, see below, or (b) that is a Qualifying Event, see below, within 90 days following the date on which such change of ownership or control has occurred, we or the acquiring entity in such change of ownership or control must redeem the Series A Preferred Shares, in whole and not in part, for cash at $25 per share. Whether the amounts to effect such redemption would be available is not determinable at the present time. This obligation could also be a detriment to a possible merger or other business combination.\nFollowing a change of ownership or control (a) involving a Qualifying Public Company or (b) that is a Qualifying Event, for a period of 90 days following the date on which the change of ownership or control has occurred, such Qualifying Public Company or the Company if there is a Qualifying Event will have the right, but not the obligation, to redeem the Series A Preferred Shares, in whole but not in party, for cash at $25 per share. Whether the amounts to effect such redemption would be available is not determinable at the present time. The existence of the Series A Preferred Stock could also be a detriment to a possible merger or other business combination.\n\u201cQualifying Public Company\u201d means a company with voting stock that is subject to a National Market Listing and that, on a pro-forma combined basis with the Company, had an EBITDA(X)-to-interest expense plus preferred dividends ratio of at least 2.0-to-1.0 for the 12-month period ending as of the end of that company\u2019s fiscal quarter immediately preceding the subject change of ownership or control.\n\u201cQualifying Event\u201d means a change of ownership or control where, after the transaction, the Company has voting stock subject to a National Market Listing and, on a pro-forma combined basis, had an EBITDA(X)-to-interest expense plus preferred dividends ratio of at least 2.0-to-1.0 for the 12-month period ending as of the end of the Company\u2019s fiscal quarter immediately preceding the subject change of ownership or control.\nThe market price of the Series A Preferred Stock could be substantially affected by various factors.\nThe market price of the Series A Preferred Stock will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including:\n\u00b7\nwhether we are paying dividends in cash on the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u00b7\nprevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u00b7\ntrading prices of common and preferred equity securities issued by other energy companies;\n\u00b7\nthe annual yield from distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and financial market conditions;\n\u00b7\ngovernment action or regulation;\n\u00b7\nthe financial condition, performance and prospects of us and our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, or competitors in our industry;\n\u00b7\nour issuance of additional preferred equity or debt securities; and\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors.\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors who purchase the Series A Preferred Stock may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.\nWe may issue additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock and additional series of preferred stock that rank on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividend rights, rights upon liquidation, or voting rights.\nWe are allowed to issue additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock and additional series of preferred stock that would rank equally to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividend payments and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs pursuant to our restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and the certificate of determination for the Series A Preferred Stock without any vote of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. The issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock and preferred stock that would rank on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock could have the effect of reducing the amounts available to the current holders of our Series A Preferred Stock upon our liquidation or dissolution or the winding up of our affairs. It also may reduce dividend payments to the current holders of the Series A Preferred Stock if we do not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on all Series A Preferred Stock outstanding and other classes of stock with equal priority with respect to dividends.\nIn addition, although holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to limited voting rights with respect to such matters, the Series A Preferred Stock will vote separately as a class along with the holders of all other classes or series of our equity securities we may issue upon which similar voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the Series A Preferred Stock. As a result, the voting rights of holders of Series A Preferred Stock may be significantly diluted, and the holders of such other series of preferred stock that we may issue may be able to control or significantly influence the outcome of any vote.\nFuture issuances and sales of preferred stock ranking on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur, may cause prevailing market prices for the Series A Preferred Stock and our common stock to decline and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to us.\nHolders of Series A Preferred Stock have limited voting rights.\nVoting rights as a holder of Series A Preferred Stock are limited. Our shares of common stock are the only class of our securities that carry full voting rights. Voting rights for holders of Series A Preferred Stock exist primarily with respect to the ability to elect two additional directors to our Board of Directors (voting together with the holders of any other classes of securities we may issue with similar voting rights), subject to certain limitations, in the event we do not pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for a total of six consecutive or non-consecutive quarterly period or upon a \u201cListing Event\u201d, which means, with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, if it is not listed on certain specified national stock exchanges (including the Nasdaq) for 180 or more consecutive days. As indicated above, we have received a notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department that our common stock is subject to potential delisting from the Nasdaq because the closing bid price of our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for 30 consecutive days. We have been provided until July 20, 2015, to regain compliance and may be able to obtain an additional 180 calendar days (until January 7, 2016) under certain circumstances to regain compliance, which cannot be assured. Thus, absent such\ncompliance or redemption in full of the Series A Preferred Stock, we may be required to create two additional board seats to our Board of Directors to be filled by a vote of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nIn addition, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have the right as a class to vote on amendments to provisions of our restated articles of incorporation or the certificate of determination relating to the Series A Preferred Stock that would:\n\u00b7\nmaterially and adversely affect the rights, preferences and voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock; or\n\u00b7\na statutory share exchange or merger that affects the Series A Preferred Stock, unless in each such case, the Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding without any material or adverse change to its terms, voting powers, preferences and rights or shall be converted into or exchanged for preferred shares of the surviving entity with substantially identical rights and preferences to the Series A Preferred Stock; or\n\u00b7\nthe authorization, reclassification or creation of, or any increase in the authorized amount of, any class ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock in a liquidation of the Company or the payment of dividends;\nprovided, however, that no vote will be required in connection with the change of ownership or control if a contemporaneous deposit is made for redemption in cash for all of the Series A Preferred Stock. Other than the limited circumstances described above, holders of Series A Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights.\nHolders of a majority of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock can agree to amend the rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock by a vote which could be to the detriment of minority holders of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nAs indicated in the risk factor immediately above, the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have certain limited voting rights, one of which allows a majority of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to agree to amendments to our restated articles of incorporation or our certificate of determination relating to the Series A Preferred Stock that could materially and adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. There may be instances where the interests of the holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock in taking such action is prejudicial to, and is not aligned with, the interests of other Series A Preferred shareholders. Accordingly, holders of a minority of such shares would not be able to block amendments that could materially and adversely affect them, for example, amendments to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at a lower price than the liquidation amount or amendments to decrease the dividend rate.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock has only a limited trading market, which may negatively affect its value and the ability to transfer and sell shares.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock has only a limited trading market. The volume of trades of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock on the Nasdaq is often low, and an active trading market on the Nasdaq for the Series A Preferred Stock may not be maintained in the future and may not provide adequate liquidity. The liquidity of any market for the Series A Preferred Stock that may exist now or in the future will depend on a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates, the dividend rate on our common stock, whether we pay dividends in cash, our financial condition and operating results, the number of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the market for similar securities and the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Series A Preferred Stock. As a result, the ability to transfer or sell the Series A Preferred Stock could be adversely affected.\nIf the Series A Preferred Stock or our common stock is delisted, the ability to transfer or sell shares of the Series A Preferred Stock may be limited, and the market value of the Series A Preferred Stock will likely be materially adversely affected.\nOther than in connection with a change of control, the Series A Preferred Stock does not contain provisions that are intended to protect stockholders if our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq. Since the Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity date, stockholders may be forced to hold their shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and receive stated dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock when, and if authorized by our board of directors and paid by us with no assurance as to ever receiving the liquidation value thereof. In addition, if our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq, it is likely that the Series A Preferred Stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq as well. Accordingly, if the Series A Preferred Stock or our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq, the ability to transfer or sell shares of the Series A Preferred Stock may be limited and the market value of the Series A Preferred Stock will likely be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 30593, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "ESCRQ"}
