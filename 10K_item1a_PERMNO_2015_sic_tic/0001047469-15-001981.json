RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Our business, operating results, financial condition or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and uncertainties. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. In addition, the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. Our business, operating results, financial performance or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. In assessing the risks and uncertainties described below, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making a decision to invest in our common stock.\nRisks related to our business and industry\nWe have a history of losses and may not achieve profitability in the future.\nWe had net income of $3.2 million and $22,006 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively, and have incurred losses since our inception, except in 2014, 2013 and 2011. We had an accumulated deficit of $78.7 million as of December 31, 2014.\nOur ability to achieve profitability in the future will likely depend on our ability to continue to increase our revenue, which is subject to a number of factors including our ability to continue to increase multi-currency processing revenue, increase new merchant deployments in the regions in which we currently operate, and add new acquiring banks, processor and card association customers in new geographies. Our revenue is also impacted by factors beyond our control such as global economic and political conditions, particularly those affecting cross-border travel and commerce, such as the continuing uncertainty in global economic conditions. Our ability to achieve profitability in the future also depends on our expense levels, including our selling, general and administrative expenses, and other expenses related to improvements in our technology, launches of new services, and our expansion into new geographic and vertical markets. In addition, our fees, interchange and assessments may also be influenced by increased competition and changes in card association rules and governmental regulations. Our efforts to grow our business may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue to offset higher expenses. These expenses, among other things, may cause our net income and working capital to decrease. If we fail to grow our revenue, manage our expenses and maintain or improve our gross profit margin, we may not achieve profitability in the future.\nIf the card associations do not allow our services to be offered, either generally or in certain geographies, then we cannot sell our services to acquiring banks, processors and merchants in those geographies and our ability to grow our business may be harmed.\nOur services require us to interconnect with the Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB and UnionPay card associations, and if these card associations do not allow acquiring banks and processors to offer certain services, either generally or in certain geographies, then we cannot sell our services to acquiring banks, processors and merchants, either generally or in those geographies. For example, in April 2010, Visa announced a moratorium on all new acquiring banks and merchants offering dynamic currency conversion, or DCC, services, such as our Pay In Your Currency service, and studied the impact of DCC on Visa cardholders and the Visa brand. In October 2010, Visa lifted the moratorium and established certain rule changes that removed a prior prohibition on offering DCC services in certain regions, namely Central Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. Prior to the lifting of this moratorium we were unable to provide DCC services in those regions to potential customers. If the card associations do not allow the offering of certain services, either generally or in certain geographies, then we will not be able to sell our services to potential customers generally or in those geographies and our ability to grow our business may be harmed.\nA limited number of our customers are responsible for a significant portion of our revenue and a decrease in revenue from these customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from agreements with a limited number of customers. Specifically, for the year ended December 31, 2014, subsidiaries of Global Payments Inc. represented 21% of our revenue. Our contractual arrangements with these customers do not obligate them to offer our services and may not dictate the timing of implementation. Additionally, if these customers lose merchants or if their merchants do not use our services, then our revenue will decrease.\nWe expect that a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in future periods. If we do not adequately perform under, or successfully renew or renegotiate, our agreements with these or other customers, our business will suffer. Our acquiring bank and processor customers typically enter into agreements with three- or five-year terms and upon the termination of that initial contractual term, customers have the opportunity to consider other providers or renegotiate the terms of the contract. The loss of our contracts with existing customers, our failure to renegotiate contracts with existing customers on terms as favorable as in the past, or a significant decline in the number of transactions we process for them could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the financial position of our customers and their willingness to pay for our services and solutions are affected by general market conditions, competitive pressures and operating margins within the banking industry. Any of these factors could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to implement our services and to market them to consumers.\nWe rely on acquiring banks, processors and merchants to integrate our services within their services and ultimately to offer our services to consumers in order to generate revenue for us. Although we have contracts with our customers, they are not obligated to offer our services and if they choose to do so, the agreements do not dictate the timing of implementation. If the pace of adoption of our services is slower than anticipated it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Following initial implementation of our services, we continue to be significantly dependent on our relationships with acquiring banks, processors and card associations to market our services to their merchants and customers. Even those contractual arrangements with our customers that contain exclusivity provisions are not perpetual, and customers could reassess their commitments to\nus in the future, purchase alternative services and/or develop their own competitive services following the expiration of the exclusivity period, which in several cases does not run for the full term of the agreement.\nAlso, we collaborate with service providers that facilitate the provision of our services, technology and service providers to the electronic payments industry, including point-of-sale system providers, such as e- commerce gateways, terminal manufacturers and other processors that have certified their solutions to our platform. These third parties include acquiring banks, processors, merchants and card associations, each of which could be a customer, as well as a supplier, in addition to commercial communications providers. If these service providers fail to perform in accordance with the requirements of the technological specifications necessary for us to provide our services to our customers, it could result in our failure to provide our services in accordance with our contracts, potentially exposing us to liability to our customers. In these cases, we may have to rely on an indemnity or other contractual obligation from the service provider in order to avoid ultimate liability or suffering damages. However, due to the inherent risk of litigation, such indemnity or other obligation may not prove to be enforceable against the service provider, or even if favorable judgment is obtained, the service provider may not have the financial ability to meet its obligations, thereby exposing us to bearing the burden of the loss.\nIn many cases, we have little or no direct access to our customers' merchant bases and are heavily reliant on our customers' sales forces to promote our services. It is ultimately up to our customers or our customers' merchants to offer our services to consumers and to do so in an effective manner, and there is no guarantee that these merchants or their consumers will continue to use our services. Our customers may not be as effective at selling our services and solutions as our own sales personnel. Our customers are also competing with other participants in the industry for processing business and may have other actual or perceived disadvantages relative to such competitors, which may affect their ability to generate business, whether or not such business includes our services and solutions. As a result, much of our business depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our acquiring banks, processors, and card associations. We further rely on the success of the merchants. If these merchants experience a reduction in transaction volume or become financially unstable, we may lose revenue. The performance of our customers and our customers' merchants is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on consumer spending.\nIn addition, we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant and consumer acceptance of the card associations' brands and programs. There can be no guarantee that merchant and consumer acceptance will continue to expand, and if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself, our business could suffer.\nAny security and privacy breaches in our systems may damage client relations, our reputation and expose us to liability.\nWe electronically collect and store sensitive personal information, such as credit card numbers, about consumers. We process that data and deliver our products and services by using computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both us and by third party service providers. The confidentiality of the consumer information that resides on our systems is critical to our business. Although, we have what we believe to be sufficient security around our systems to prevent unauthorized access, we cannot be certain that our measures will be successful and sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats designed to breach our systems or otherwise gain unauthorized access to confidential information. If we are unable to protect, or our customers perceive that we are unable to protect, the security and privacy of our electronic transactions:\n\u2022 our clients may lose confidence in our services;\n\u2022 our reputation may be harmed;\n\u2022 we may be exposed to unbudgeted or uninsured financial liability;\n\u2022 it may become more difficult for us to register with card associations;\n\u2022 we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny; and\n\u2022 our expenses may increase as a result of potential remediation costs.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and employees could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation is damaged. While we believe we use proven applications and processes designed for data security and integrity to process electronic transactions, there can be no assurance that our use of these applications and processes will be sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats designed to breach our systems or otherwise gain unauthorized access to confidential client information or our intellectual property or address the security and privacy concerns of existing and potential customers. Any failures in our security and privacy measures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny new laws, regulations, card association rules or other industry standards affecting our business, or any changes made to them, in any of the geographic regions in which we operate may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable impact on our financial results.\nWe are subject to regulations that affect the electronic payments industry in the countries and territories in which we operate. Regulation and proposed regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years. Failure to comply with regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration, the limitation, suspension or termination of service, and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. For example, we are subject to:\n\u2022 the rules of Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, JCB, UnionPay and other payment networks;\n\u2022 applicable privacy and information security regulations in the regions where we operate and of the card associations;\n\u2022 banking and financial regulations or monetary authority rules in the jurisdictions in which we operate; and\n\u2022 governmental regulation of the payments, payment processing and financial services industries.\nFor example, in April 2010, Visa announced a moratorium on all new acquiring banks and merchants offering DCC services, including our Pay In Your Currency service, and studied the impact of DCC on Visa cardholders and the Visa brand. In October 2010, Visa lifted the moratorium and also established certain rule changes that removed a prior prohibition on offering DCC services in certain regions, namely Central Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. Prior to the lifting of this moratorium we were unable to provide DCC services in those regions to existing or potential customers. In addition, Visa now charges acquiring banks an annual fee of $45,000 for each country or territory in which they offer a DCC service. Both Visa and MasterCard may also charge additional cross-border fees for transactions involving DCC. Visa's new compliance regime for DCC includes unannounced \"mystery shopping\" audits of our customer's merchants, to assess merchant compliance with the regulations applicable to DCC. Repeated failure by an acquiring bank or merchant to comply with regulations can result in substantial fines and could ultimately result in a prohibition upon such acquiring bank or merchant offering DCC. Remediation of negative audit findings can be costly and time consuming for our customers and the mere risk of such fines may reduce the number of acquiring banks willing to offer Pay in Your Currency services.\nInterchange fees, which are typically paid by the acquiring bank to the card issuing bank in connection with transactions, are subject to increasingly intense legal, regulatory, and legislative scrutiny worldwide. For instance, in the United States, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank Act, requires the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to regulate the fees charged or received by card issuing banks for processing point-of-sale debit card transactions. Rules limiting point-of-sale debit card interchange fees and restricting routing rules and network exclusivity became effective in 2011, although a number of the rules regulating the limit on debit card interchange fees were struck down in 2013 by a U.S. Federal Court. Certain of our customers or potential customers may experience difficulty complying with any new regulations and as a result, reduce or eliminate purchases of services such as ours. In addition, regulatory actions that impact our industry, even if not directed at us, may require significant efforts and costs to change our services and may require changes to how we price our services to customers. We cannot predict the impact of any of these changes on our operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we are registered with the card associations and other payment networks as a third party processor and an independent sales organization, or ISO, we do not actively participate in their affairs by, for example, participating in the development of operating rules and procedures. The card associations could adopt new operating rules or interpretations of the existing rules that could be damaging to our competitive position because, for example, compliance might be difficult for us or our customers, but not for other participants.\nChanges in the electronic payments industry in general, or changes in the laws and regulations that affect the electronic payments industry, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations could damage our business or our reputation.\nWe rely on our management team and will need to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur success and future growth depend on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team and other key personnel. The loss of any of member of our senior management team could adversely affect our business. All of our employees in the United States work for us on an at-will basis, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time. We do not maintain key-person life insurance on any of our employees.\nOur future success will also depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel who have experience with our operations, the rapidly changing transaction processing industry, and the selected markets in which we offer our services. Competition for these types of personnel is intense, particularly in the New York metro area, where our headquarters are located. Additionally, we have significant operations abroad, including developing countries, and attracting highly skilled personnel with the necessary experience in these locations may be difficult.\nVolatility or lack of successful performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key personnel. Many of our senior management personnel and other key employees have become, or will soon become, vested in a substantial amount of stock or stock options. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested stock options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly above the market price of shares of our common stock. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract, retain or motivate such personnel, and our inability to do so could adversely affect our business.\nWe are required to be registered with Visa and MasterCard in order to provide our services, and we rely on the sponsorship of our acquiring bank customers for this registration.\nOur services require us to interconnect with the Visa and MasterCard card associations, and to therefore be registered with those card associations. Since we are not a bank, Visa and MasterCard operating regulations require us to be sponsored by an acquiring bank in order to process payment card transactions. We are currently registered with Visa and MasterCard through the sponsorship of acquiring banks that are members of the card associations and a significant majority of our revenue is from transactions processed using Visa and MasterCard payment cards. If these sponsorships are terminated and we are unable to secure another bank sponsor, we will not be able to process payment card transactions. By registering with card associations, we are subject to card association rules that could subject us or our customers to fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations for certain acts or omissions. If we or our acquiring bank sponsors fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the card associations, the card associations could fine us, suspend us or terminate our registration. The termination or suspension of our registration could require us to stop providing payment processing services, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order for us to continue to grow and improve our operating results, we must continue to increase participation by existing customers, develop new services, cross sell additional services and add new customers in existing and new geographies.\nOur future growth depends in part upon our ability to increase participation by our acquiring bank and processor customers' merchants in the various services that we offer, develop new services, cross sell additional services to existing acquiring bank, processor and merchant customers, and add new acquiring banks, processors, card associations and merchants in existing and new geographies.\nIn order to increase participation by our customers and their merchants in the various services that we offer together, we need to collaborate with our customers. However, our existing acquiring bank and processor customers may not assist us in increasing participation by their merchants or their merchants may be unreceptive to using our services. If we are not successful in developing, selling and deploying new services (whether in response to market demand or technological changes), we may not be able to achieve planned growth and any development costs incurred may be wasted. If our existing customers do not appreciate, and our sales force does not demonstrate, the benefits of our additional services, we will not be able to effectively cross sell to existing customers. Our expansion into new geographies is also dependent upon our ability to deploy our existing platform or to develop new services to meet the particular service needs of each new geographic location. We may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure services that will satisfy the demands of these new markets.\nIf we fail to increase participation by existing customers, develop new services, cross sell additional services and add new customers in existing and new geographies, we may not be able to continue to grow and improve our operating results.\nFees that may be charged in connection with our Pay In Your Currency processing service are subject to change.\nWhen a consumer uses our Pay In Your Currency processing service, they pay a fee that is included in the exchange rate used for each Pay In Your Currency transaction. While Visa and MasterCard rules permit merchants and other third parties to charge these fees, if these card associations change their policies in permitting merchants and other third parties to charge these fees, otherwise restrict the ability to do so or if the card associations increase the additional fees charged for\nproviding such service, as they have done from time to time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, some card issuing banks impose a fee on consumers for any foreign transaction, irrespective of the currency in which it occurred. Where this occurs, the consumer will pay the card issuing bank an extra fee on a foreign transaction in addition to any margin reflected by us in the cost of the converted amount for our Pay In Your Currency service. This additional cost, and other efforts by the card issuing banks to discourage consumers from utilizing our services, may adversely affect consumers' willingness to use our services.\nWe are subject to international business uncertainties.\nOur ability to grow our business and our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention. Historically, a significant majority of our revenue has been generated from international customers, including international customers of North American merchants. For example, in 2014, we generated 69% of our revenue internationally and 31% in the United States. International revenue and operations may be subject to risks such as:\n\u2022 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022 burdens of complying with a wide variety of laws, regulations and standards;\n\u2022 controls on or obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash;\n\u2022 currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022 different tax burdens;\n\u2022 preference for local vendors;\n\u2022 trade restrictions;\n\u2022 changes in tariffs;\n\u2022 the imposition of government controls;\n\u2022 nationalization or seizure by banking regulators of our customers;\n\u2022 political instability;\n\u2022 exposure to a business culture in which improper sales practices may be prevalent; and\n\u2022 terrorist activities.\nThe legal systems of developing countries continue to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and us. In certain instances, local implementation rules and/or the actual implementation are not consistent with the regulations at the national level. Additionally, the laws of certain countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, as well as civil remedies, including fines, injunctions and recalls of our services and solutions.\nInternational expansion and market acceptance depend on our ability to modify our business approach and technology to take into account such factors as differing customer business models, services requirements and needs, the applicable regulatory and business environment, labor costs and other economic conditions. There can be no assurance that these factors will not have an adverse effect\non our future international revenue and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and other laws in the United States and elsewhere that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations in and deal with countries known to experience corruption. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, contractors or customers that could be in violation of various laws, including the FCPA, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. We have implemented safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees, consultants and customers. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, contractors or customers may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse changes in political and economic policies of the Chinese government could impede the overall economic growth of China, which could reduce the demand for our services and solutions and damage our business.\nWe conduct significant operations, including through an indirect subsidiary and a branch office, and generate a significant portion of our revenue, in China, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, which are special administrative regions of China.\nAccordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in China. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including:\n\u2022 a higher level of government involvement;\n\u2022 an early stage of development of the market-oriented sector of the economy;\n\u2022 a rapid growth rate;\n\u2022 a higher level of control over foreign exchange; and\n\u2022 the control over the allocation of resources.\nAs the Chinese economy transitions from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy, the Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Although these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, they may have a negative effect on us. Although the Chinese government has in recent years implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the Chinese government continues to exercise significant control over economic growth in China through the allocation of resources, controlling the payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, state ownership and imposing policies that impact particular industries or companies in different ways. For example, the Chinese government has suggested that Chinese government authorities should strengthen access and supervision with respect to the outsourcing of bank card data processing and related operations, specifically noting the need for specific regulations with respect to foreign-invested organizations that engage in related services in China.\nOur ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. Government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local\nvariations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof.\nAny adverse change in economic conditions or government policies in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth in China, which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our services and solutions and consequently adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our net revenue from a limited number of countries and territories, and any natural disasters or other adverse changes could harm our business.\nA significant portion of our net revenue is derived from six countries and territories. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we derived 31%, 16%, 16%, 6%, 5% and 5% of our net revenue, from the United States, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Latin America, China and Canada, respectively. We expect that a limited number of countries and territories will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue in future periods. If any of these countries or territories are affected by acts of terrorism, political unrest, natural disasters, the effects of climate change, outbreaks of diseases or other significant adverse changes, cross-border travel to these countries and territories could decline, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries or territories in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business can be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, such as general geopolitical, economic, and business conditions. As a result of the continuing global economic uncertainty, concerns over the downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt and monetary and financial uncertainties internationally, international travel and spending may be reduced. We cannot predict the reoccurrence of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of the economic recovery, or the magnitude of any changes in geopolitical or economic conditions and the affect they would have on our business. Continuing economic uncertainty or a further weakening in the global economy may reduce the number of settled transactions and dollar volumes processed and, as a result, reduce our revenue.\nAdditionally, we generate a significant amount of our revenue from cross- border transactions. Thus, revenue from processing cross-border transactions for our customers fluctuates with cross-border travel and the need for transactions to be converted into a different currency. Cross-border travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical, economic and other conditions. These include the threat of terrorism, natural disasters, the effects of climate change, outbreaks of diseases, such as the Ebola virus, war, such as in Ukraine and the Middle East and political unrest, such as the recent demonstrations in 2013 and 2014 in Brazil, Hong Kong and other countries. A decline in cross-border travel could adversely affect our revenue. A decline in the need for conversion of currencies might also adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nAdditionally, because we are domiciled in the United States, a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidation among financial institutions, including the merger of our customers with entities that are not our customers or the sale of portfolios of merchants by our customers to entities that are not our customers could materially impact our financial position and results of operation.\nWe face the risk that our acquiring bank or processor customers may merge with entities that are not our customers or may sell portfolios of merchants to entities that are not our customers, thereby\nimpacting our existing agreements and projected revenue with these customers. Consolidation among financial institutions results in an increasingly concentrated client base of large acquiring banks and processors which could increase the bargaining power of our current and future customers. In addition, any nationalization or seizure of one of our acquiring bank customers by banking regulators in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate may also impact the services that we provide. Any significant changes in the ownership or operation of our customers, as a result of consolidation or otherwise, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our services and solutions do not interoperate with our customers' systems or experience defects, errors, or delays, the purchase or deployment of our services and solutions may be delayed or cancelled.\nOur services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems and are designed to interface with our customers' payment card systems, each of which may have different specifications and utilize different standards. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers' systems, or if there are errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions or defects in our software, we may need to modify our services or solutions to fix or overcome these errors, delays and defects and/or our customers may need to modify or fix their systems so that our services and solutions will interoperate with the existing software and hardware. Either of these solutions could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, loss of credibility with current or potential customers, harm to our reputation, breaches in security and/or exposure to liability claims. Such errors and defects and any delays in fixing them, whether in our system or those of our customers could impact the processing of transactions, which would have an adverse effect on our revenues derived from transaction processing. In addition, if our services and solutions do not interoperate with our customers' systems, customers may seek to hold us liable and demand for our services and solutions could be adversely affected. Any of these events could hurt our operating results, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterruptions or delays in service from our systems and processing centers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nWe currently serve our customers out of seven synchronized processing centers linked by a global telecommunications network. Our primary data centers are located in Elmsford, New York, and New Castle, Delaware, but we also host facilities in Bermuda, Dublin, Shanghai and Macau and host two facilities in Hong Kong, through co-location arrangements. We depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems, software, telecommunications networks, and processing centers, as well as the systems and services of third parties.\nOur systems and processing centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist acts, war, unauthorized entry, human error, and computer viruses or other defects. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct.\nWe have security, backup and recovery systems in place, as well as business continuity plans designed to ensure our systems will not be inoperable. However, there is still a risk that a system outage or data loss may occur which would not only damage our reputation but as a result of contractual commitments could also require the payment of penalties to our clients if our systems do not meet certain operating standards. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of sabotage or terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be applicable or adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur.\nAny damage to, failure of, or defects in our systems or those of third parties, errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions, telecommunications failures or other difficulties could result in loss of revenue, loss of merchants, loss of merchant and consumer data, harm to our business or reputation, exposure to fraud losses or other liabilities, negative publicity, additional operating and development costs, and diversion of technical and other resources.\nIf we fail to respond to evolving technological changes, our services and solutions could become obsolete or less competitive.\nOur industry is characterized by new and rapidly evolving technologies, developing industry standards and legal regulations and customer requirements and preferences. Recent technological developments include smart cards, money transfer, mobile commerce and radio frequency and proximity payment devices, such as contactless cards. Accordingly, our operating results depend upon, among other things, our ability to anticipate and respond to these industry and customer changes in order to remain competitive. The process of developing new technologies and services and solutions is complex, and carry the risks associated with any research and development effort, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance problems.\nOur markets are experiencing rapid technological change. Any delay in the delivery of new services or solutions or the failure to differentiate our services and solutions could render them less desirable to our customers, or possibly even obsolete. In addition, our services and solutions are designed to process complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions, all at high volumes and processing speeds. Any failure to deliver an effective and secure service or solution, or any performance issue that arises with a new service or solution could result in significant processing or reporting errors, possibly resulting in losses.\nIf we are unable to develop enhancements and new features for our existing services and solutions or new services and solutions that keep pace with technological developments, industry standards, legal regulations, and customer requirements and preferences, our services and solutions may become obsolete and less marketable, and our business could be significantly harmed. Additionally, if there are delays in the introduction of new features or new services and solutions to the market, our business could be significantly harmed.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and we compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources, and our business may be harmed if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively.\nCompetition in our market is intense and involves rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service introductions, and changes in customer requirements. To maintain and improve our competitive position, we must keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers and continue to develop and introduce new features, services and solutions in a timely and efficient manner. Our primary competitors are international payment processors, multi-currency payment service providers and global e-commerce payment service providers.\nCurrently, there is a high level of concentration in the international payment processing industry, with a few large processors providing payment card processing services to acquiring banks on a multi-national and multi-regional basis. International processors with whom we compete include: First Data Corporation, with its OmniPay Limited subsidiary operating a multi-currency platform; Elavon, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, that operates in the Americas; and WorldPay (UK) Limited, that also primarily services the Americas and Europe and which in 2014 acquired Cobre Bem Tecnologia, a leading provider of payment solutions in Latin America. We may also compete against prospective acquiring bank customers and regional processors that may prefer to develop and offer their own payment processing solution.\nThe multi-currency payment service industry is largely segmented among large, international processors, which provide multi-currency processing services as part of their broader international payment processing service, including those referenced above, and smaller companies who work on a regional or local basis to provide DCC or multi-currency processing services on behalf of acquiring banks or merchants. Specialized DCC providers include: FEXCO Holdings; Travelex Holdings Limited; Global Blue; Monex Financial Services Limited; Euronet Worldwide, Pure Commerce Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Euronet Worldwide; Fintrax Group, Ltd.; and Continuum Commerce Ltd.\nIn the global e-commerce payment space, our Shop In Your Currency service and iPAY Gateway, or iPAY, compete with several international online payment service providers, including CyberSource Corporation, a subsidiary of Visa, MasterCard International Gateway Services, or MIGS, PayPal, Inc., Borderfree, Inc., GlobalCollect, WorldPay (UK) Limited, and Payvision. In the United States, we compete against acquiring banks offering multi-currency processing solutions to online merchants, including Chase Paymentech and Bank of America. In the Asia Pacific region, we compete against regional providers, including AsiaPay Limited, or JETCO, and eNETS Pte Ltd, but also support MIGS and AsiaPay Limited. Our iPAY service competes with them based on the specialized multi-currency solutions we offer. We also work cooperatively with several payment gateway providers to offer Shop In Your Currency services online, including RocketGate, USAePAY and Plug'n Pay but also support our services through certain competitors including CyberSource, MIGS and PayPal.\nSeveral of our competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as:\n\u2022 greater name and brand recognition and longer operating histories;\n\u2022 larger sales and marketing budgets and resources;\n\u2022 greater resources to make acquisitions of other competitors or products, services and technologies that strengthen their service and solution offerings and increase their presence in the market;\n\u2022 lower labor and development costs;\n\u2022 larger intellectual property portfolios related to electronic payment methods and systems; and\n\u2022 substantially greater financial, technical, customer support and other resources.\nConditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or market consolidation. For example, one of our smaller payment processing competitors may be acquired by a larger company with significant resources, and could leverage those resources to become a more significant competitive presence in our market. The development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our services and solutions or render them obsolete.\nOur competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to the development of new technologies, including Internet payment processing services that provide improved operating functionality and features to their service and solution offerings. If successful, their development efforts could render our services and solutions less desirable to customers. If we are unable to compete successfully in the future, our business may be harmed.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our financial performance may suffer.\nWe have substantially expanded our overall business, customer base, employee headcount and operations in recent periods both domestically and internationally. Our expansion has placed, and our expected future growth will continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, customer operations, research and development, sales and marketing, manufacturing, administrative, financial and\nother resources. In particular, we provided our services to approximately 17,000 active merchant locations in 16 countries and territories as of December 31, 2010 and approximately 93,000 active merchant locations in 23 countries and territories as of December 31, 2014. Our growth strategy contemplates further increasing the number of our customers and active merchant locations, however, the rate at which we have been able to establish relationships with our customers and active merchant locations in the past may not be indicative of the rate at which we will be able to do so in the future.\nOur success will depend in part upon the ability of our management team to manage growth effectively. Our ability to grow also depends upon our ability to successfully hire, train, supervise, and manage new employees, obtain financing for our capital needs, expand our systems effectively, control increasing costs, allocate our human resources optimally, enhance and improve our operational functions and our finance and accounting functions, and manage the pressures on our management and administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately anticipate and respond to the changing demands we will face as we continue to expand our operations or that we will be able to manage growth effectively or to achieve further growth at all. If our business does not continue to grow or if we fail to effectively manage any future growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations, and, as a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock.\nWe expect our quarterly revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. The factors that may affect the unpredictability of our quarterly results include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 our dependence on a limited number of customers;\n\u2022 our reliance on acquiring banks, processors, merchants and other technology providers to integrate our services within their services and to offer our services to consumers;\n\u2022 the timing of new service launches with new and existing customers;\n\u2022 our inability to increase sales to existing customers, retain existing customers and attract new customers;\n\u2022 seasonality in the use of our services, as our revenue has historically been seasonal with the second and third quarters of our year traditionally having less revenue compared to the first and fourth fiscal quarters;\n\u2022 changes in our pricing policies;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of operating expenses and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022 the timing of revenue and expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies, products, services or businesses;\n\u2022 changing market conditions;\n\u2022 competition;\n\u2022 failures of our services that result in contractual penalties or terminations; and\n\u2022 economic, regulatory and political conditions in the markets where we operate or anticipate operating, particularly those impacting cross-border travel and commerce.\nAs a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be. It is likely that in some future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which case the price of shares of our common stock may decline and we could face costly securities class action suits or other unanticipated issues.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our operating results.\nOur revenue has historically been seasonal with the first quarter of our year traditionally having less revenue compared to the prior fourth fiscal quarter. We have experienced that increased international travel and spending by consumers around the holiday season during the fourth quarter of our year to have relatively higher revenue than our other quarters. Our seasonal volumes and revenue trends could change from those we have historically experienced upon our entry into new geographies.\nIn addition, the timing of signing a contract and implementing our services with a large acquiring bank or processor and bringing their merchants on board may overshadow seasonal factors in any particular quarterly period. In the future, we may experience revenue growth from additional other factors such as regulatory mandates that could continue to mask underlying seasonality of our business. Seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our results of operations in the future. We expect seasonality to continue to impact our business in the future.\nWhere we have direct contractual acquiring relationships with merchants, we incur chargeback liability when our merchants fail to reimburse chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers. We cannot accurately anticipate these liabilities, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the event a billing dispute between a consumer and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant, the transaction is normally \"charged back\" to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the consumer. If we are acting as the acquiring bank by virtue of our status as an ISO or under our acquiring agreements with American Express, Discover, JCB and UnionPay and are unable to collect such amounts from the merchant's account or reserve account (if applicable), or if the merchant refuses or is unable, due to closure, bankruptcy or other reasons, to reimburse us for a chargeback, we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the consumer. The risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those merchants that promise future delivery of goods and services rather than delivering goods or rendering services at the time of payment. Although only a small part of our revenue is derived from direct contractual acquiring relationships with merchants, any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhere we have direct contractual acquiring relationships with merchants, fraud by merchants or others or the violation of card association requirements by merchants could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have potential liability for fraudulent bankcard transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others where we are acting as the acquiring bank by virtue of our status as an ISO or under our acquiring agreements with American Express, Discover, JCB and UnionPay. Examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant processes fraudulent debit transactions or credits an accomplice's payment card for transactions that did not occur or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeit and fraud. While we have systems and procedures designed to detect and reduce the impact of fraud, we cannot ensure the effectiveness of these measures. It is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future. Failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud would increase our chargeback liability or other liability. Additionally, if\na merchant fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the card associations, including for example where a merchant is a victim of fraud or its data is compromised due to a failure to comply with PCI or card association data security standards, it could be subject to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations. If we cannot collect such amounts from the applicable merchant, we could end up bearing such fines or penalties. Although only a small part of our revenue are derived from direct contractual relationships with merchants, increases in chargebacks or other liability could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange risk.\nWe perform currency conversion data processing services, which involves processing and accounting for payments in multiple currencies. The currency conversion underlying such services is presently carried out through the card associations and certain acquiring banks with different exchange rates being applied to a transaction on authorization and subsequent settlement. In most cases, we may have exposure to between one and three days of currency exchange risk. Daily fluctuations will occur in the rate of exchange of the various currencies for which we offer multi-currency payment processing. These fluctuations may be favorable or adverse. Although there can be no guarantee that future fluctuations will match events to date, our analysis of these variations over an extended period of years indicates that variations over the short run have been substantially less than the margin that we charge for multi- currency payment processing transactions, and over the long run to date, the average variation has been nominal. In most cases, we share revenue with acquiring banks and processors and merchants after taking into account foreign exchange fluctuations, and therefore the risk is borne proportionately by us and the other parties participating in these transactions. Although we do not currently engage in hedging or other techniques to minimize exposure to currency exchange risk, we may decide to do so in the future as international transactional volume increases, and such techniques would introduce additional risks, including the risk that a counterparty may be unable to fulfill its obligations to us under such contracts.\nAdditionally, in the future, it is possible that an increasing proportion of our revenue will be received in non-U.S. currencies that may be subject to foreign currency risk as international currencies fluctuate relative to the value of the U.S. Dollar. Resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income. This may give rise to an exchange risk against the U.S. Dollar upon repatriation of foreign currency earnings or upon consolidation for financial account purposes. We will consider strategies for managing and hedging such risks once the volume of foreign earnings reaches certain threshold levels. Furthermore, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of its revenue currencies into U.S. Dollars or other freely tradable currencies. The occurrence of any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may suffer if it is alleged or found that our services infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\nThe operation of our business may subject us to claims of infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly to defend in litigation, divert management's attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand, and cause us to incur significant expenses. Even if we are indemnified against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. Further, claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to redesign or replace affected services, delay affected service offerings, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing, selling or distributing the affected services. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be\nadversely impacted. Additionally, our customers may not purchase our services if they are concerned that our services infringe third party intellectual property rights. This could reduce the market opportunity for the sale of our services and solutions.\nFor example, a competitor holds a patent for a particular method of performing DCC in several countries and territories including Canada, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore and Taiwan, which could obstruct or impair us from doing business in those jurisdictions. Other parties, including other competitors, have filed patent applications or obtained patents with respect to various aspects of DCC in the United States and abroad. We closely monitor these applications and the actions of other parties who hold patents relating to DCC. Our ability to do business in particular jurisdictions may be severely impaired in the event that a third party successfully argues that any of our services, including Pay In Your Currency, infringe a patent held by such third party. Any pre-emptive legal action or legal action to defend against a lawsuit may not be successful, and could result in substantial legal fees, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, we are contractually obligated to indemnify certain customers or other third parties that use our services for losses suffered or incurred in the event our services are alleged to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights. The term of these indemnity provisions is generally perpetual after execution of the customer agreement subject to the statute of limitations.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, to the extent available, may be very difficult to enforce and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had four issued patents in the United States, Australia, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Taiwan. We also have patent applications pending in the United States and several other jurisdictions, all of which are counterparts to our patents and patent applications in the United States. Our patents generally have a duration of 20 years from the relevant priority date of each patent. We cannot ensure that any of our pending applications will be granted or that any of our issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property. Any patents that may be issued to us may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. In addition, third parties could claim invalidity, co-inventorship, re-examination, or similar claims with respect to any of our currently issued patents or any patents that may be issued to us in the future. Any such claims, whether or not successful, could be extremely costly to defend, divert management's attention and resources, damage our reputation and brand, and substantially harm our business.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented technology and trade secrets. We generally seek to protect this information by confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with which we do business. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, our trade secrets may be disclosed to or otherwise become known or be\nindependently developed by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, or other third parties with whom we do business use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nIn order to protect or enforce our proprietary technology, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as patent infringement suits or patent interference proceedings. Litigation may be necessary to assert claims of infringement, enforce our patents, protect our trade secrets or know-how, or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert management's attention from other business concerns. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable.\nIf, for any of the above reasons, our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to enforce our contracts with our customers, including any exclusivity arrangements.\nIf our customers do not comply with the terms of our contracts, such as the payment of fees or exclusivity arrangements, we may lose revenue and this may adversely affect our business. Particularly, if those customers with whom we have exclusivity arrangements do not comply with these provisions, we may lose business to our competitors. If our customers do not comply with the provisions of our contracts, we may be required to enter into expensive litigation in order to enforce our rights. We cannot be certain that any such litigation would be successful. Even if successful, litigation may merely prevent a customer from engaging in competitive activity but would not necessarily require the customer to continue to use our services and, in any event, may severely harm the working relationship with such customer and other existing and potential customers that may learn of the litigation.\nThe costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in various litigation matters and governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our business. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any pending or future litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations In addition, we may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, the expense of defending litigation may be significant, the amount of time to resolve lawsuits is unpredictable and defending ourselves may divert management's attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to acquire and integrate other businesses, services or technologies could seriously harm our competitive position.\nIn order to remain competitive, obtain key competencies or accelerate our time to market, we may seek to acquire additional businesses or technologies and new products. To date, we have a limited history of acquisitions. Most recently, in May 2012, we completed the acquisition of Branded Payment Solutions Ltd, or BPS, a payments technology company headquartered in Ireland. If we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition,\nfinancing the acquisition, or effectively integrating the acquired business, services or technology into our existing business and operations. We may have difficulty integrating acquired technologies or products with our existing services and solutions. Our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, services or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, quality, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, deficiencies or weaknesses in the disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, or employee or customer issues. If we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of shares of our common stock. In addition, any acquisitions we are able to complete may not result in the synergies or any other benefits we had expected to achieve, which could result in substantial write-offs. Contemplating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business, services or technology will significantly divert management and employee time and resources. Further, if the integration process does not proceed smoothly, the following factors, among others, could reduce our revenue and earnings, increase our operating costs, and result in a loss of projected synergies:\n\u2022 if we are unable to successfully integrate the benefits, duties and responsibilities, and other factors of interest to the management and employees of any acquired business, we could lose employees to our competitors in the region, which could significantly affect our ability to operate the business and complete the integration; and\n\u2022 if the integration process of any acquired business causes any delays with the delivery of our services, or the quality of those services, we could lose customers to our competitors, which would reduce our revenue and earnings.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" and any decision on our part to comply with certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act enacted in April 2012. We will remain an \"emerging growth company\" until the earliest of (i) the last fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of an initial public offering of our equity securities; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \"large accelerated filer.\" For as long as we continue to be an \"emerging growth company,\" we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder Section 107(b) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nOur business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance, disclosure controls, internal control over financial reporting and other compliance areas that will increase both our costs and the risk of noncompliance. If we fail to comply with these regulations we could face difficulties in preparing and filing timely and accurate financial reports.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Maintaining compliance with these rules and regulations, particularly after we cease to be an emerging growth company, will increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, will make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and may also place increased strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we will be required to provide attestation that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures by our registered public accounting firm. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required to include in our periodic reports filed with the SEC, under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act or the annual auditor attestation reports regarding effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting that we will be required to include in our periodic reports filed with the SEC, beginning for our year ending December 31, 2017, unless, under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, we meet certain criteria that would require such reports to be included prior to then, under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of shares of our common stock.\nIn order to maintain the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting going forward, we will need to expend significant resources and provide significant management oversight. There is a substantial effort involved in continuing to implement appropriate processes, document our system of internal control over relevant processes, assess their design, remediate any deficiencies identified and test their operation. As a result, management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. These efforts will also involve substantial accounting- related costs. Prior to becoming subject to the Exchange Act in December 2012, we were not required to test our internal controls within a specified period and, as a result, we may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner.\nIf we are unable to maintain key controls currently in place or that we implement in the future and pending such implementation, or if any difficulties are encountered in their implementation or improvement, (1) our management might not be able to certify, and our independent registered public accounting firm might not be able to report on, the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, which would cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, (2) misstatements in our financial statements may occur that may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and (3) we may be deemed to have significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImplementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, our internal controls are perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, our stock price could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of NASDAQ may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain or increase coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate directors' and officers' insurance, our ability to recruit and retain qualified directors, especially those directors who may be considered independent for purposes of NASDAQ rules, and officers may be curtailed.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\nIn the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons. We may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carry forwards, which could adversely affect our results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had available federal net operating loss carry forwards of $67.2 million, state net operating loss carry forwards, primarily the state of New York, of $68.1 million, and various foreign net operating loss carry forwards, the most significant of which expire between 2020 and 2033. Realization of these net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon future income arising prior to the expiration dates and other factors under the relevant provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Our existing net operating loss carry forwards could expire and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities or the use of our net operating loss carry forwards could be limited, which would adversely affect our results.\nOur business and financial performance could be negatively impacted by the application of new tax regulations or changes in existing tax laws or regulations.\nWe are subject to taxation by various jurisdictions on our net income or fees charged to customers for our services. New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time. Additionally, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. These events could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines and/or penalties and interest for past amounts deemed to be due. If we raise our prices to offset the costs of these changes, existing and potential future customers may elect not to continue or purchase our services and solutions in the future. If we are unable to pass these tax expenses on to our customers, our costs will increase, reducing our earnings. Any or all of these events could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nRisks related to ownership of our common stock\nTo date, there has been only a limited market for our common stock in the United States and an active trading market for our common stock may not develop in the United States.\nTo date, there has been a limited public market for shares of our common stock in the United States. From 2006 to August 2014, our common stock traded on AIM under the symbol \"PPT\" and from 2006 to June 2013 our common stock also traded on AIM under the symbol \"PPTR.\" From 2008 until December 2012, our common stock traded on the OTCQX in the United States under the symbol \"PLPM\" and since December 2012, our common stock has traded on the NASDAQ. There is currently a limited volume of trading in our common stock on the NASDAQ, which affects the liquidity of common stock. We cannot predict when or whether investor interest in our common stock might lead to an increase in its market price or the development of a more active trading market. An active trading market for our shares in the United States may never develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not develop, it may be difficult to sell shares of our common stock without depressing the market price for the shares, or at all.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of listed companies. The market price of our common stock, like the securities of many other technology companies, fluctuates over a wide range, and will continue to be highly volatile in the future. During 2014, the closing price of our common stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market ranged from $1.37 to $3.95 per share. Stock prices of many newly public companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market pursuant to registration rights of certain stockholders. If there are substantial sales of shares of our common stock, the price of shares of our common stock could decline.\nThe price of shares of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or if there is a large number of shares of our common stock available for sale. As of February 28, 2015, we\nhad 62,067,460 shares of common stock (which includes 55,216,316 shares of common stock outstanding and 6,851,144 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of preferred stock).\nThe holders of up to an aggregate of 6,768,874 shares of our common stock (which includes shares of our Series A Preferred Stock on an as-converted to common stock basis) outstanding as of February 28, 2015 have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders.\nAdditionally, we have registered shares of common stock that we issue under our employee equity incentive plans. These shares may be sold freely in the public market upon issuance. The market price of the shares of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a substantial number of our shares in the public market or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares.\nIf securities or industry analysts in the United States do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have widespread research coverage by securities analysts in the United States, and industry analysts that currently cover us may cease to do so. If there is limited securities analysts' coverage of our company, or if industry analysts cease coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nOur directors, executive officers and principal stockholders have substantial control over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nAs of February 28, 2015, our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 5% of our common stock (which includes preferred stock on an as converted to common stock basis), together with their affiliates, beneficially own, in the aggregate, 43.2% of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of shares of our common stock by:\n\u2022 delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us;\n\u2022 impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u2022 discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of shares of our common stock increases.\nHolders of our Series A Preferred Stock have rights that are superior to holders of our common stock.\nIf we ever liquidate or sell our company to another company or transfer substantially all of our assets or a majority of our stock to another company, the holders of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock may be entitled to receive proceeds prior and in preference to the holders of our common stock pursuant to the rights set forth in our certificate of incorporation. Accordingly, it is possible that you will receive nothing in exchange for your shares in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or sale of our company.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of shares of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors, including the following:\n\u2022 our Board of Directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022 only our chairman of the board, our chief executive officer, our president or a majority of our Board of Directors is authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022 our stockholders may only take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022 vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by our Board of Directors and not by stockholders;\n\u2022 directors may be removed from office only for cause;\n\u2022 our certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval, and authorizes shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, which are currently outstanding;\n\u2022 advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022 if two-thirds of our Board of Directors approves the amendment of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or any provisions thereof, then such amendment need only be approved by stockholders holding a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote; otherwise, such amendment must be approved by stockholders holding two-thirds of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote.", "PERMNO": 13705, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "PLPM"}
