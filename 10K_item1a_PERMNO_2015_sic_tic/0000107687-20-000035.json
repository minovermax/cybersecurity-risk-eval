{"cik": "107687", "company": "WINNEBAGO INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-10-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nDescribed below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. The following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties highlighted represent the most significant risk factors that we believe may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing, and, consequently, the market value of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties discussed in this report are not exclusive and other risk factors that we may consider immaterial or do not anticipate may emerge as significant risks and uncertainties.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business and financial results are expected to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The severity, magnitude and duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, rapidly changing and hard to predict. In Fiscal 2020, COVID-19 significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our business in numerous ways, including but not limited to those outlined below, and we expect these impacts to continue into Fiscal 2021 and beyond:\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global economic slowdown that may last for an extended duration, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession.\n\u2022Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced and could continue to experience reductions in customer demand for certain products. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2020, we experienced reductions in customer demand due to a decrease in consumer spending attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, certain elements of our business (including certain elements of our operations, supply chains and distribution systems), including required, preventive and precautionary measures that we, our communities and governments are taking. These impacts include requiring employees to work from home or not go into their offices, limiting the number of employees attending meetings and using digital options when available, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, reducing employee travel and adopting other employee safety measures. These measures may also impact our ability to meet production demands or requests depending on employee attendance or ability to continue to work.\n\u2022If the COVID-19 pandemic continues and economic conditions worsen, we expect to experience additional adverse impacts on our operational and commercial activities, customer orders and our collections of accounts receivable, which may be material. The impact on future operational and commercial activities, customer orders, and collections remains uncertain even if economic conditions begin to improve.\n\u2022Government or regulatory responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have and may continue to negatively impact our business. In Fiscal 2020, mandatory shelter-in-place or other restrictions on operations have temporarily disrupted our ability to manufacture or distribute our products in some markets and our dealers' ability to retail our products in certain markets. Continuation or expansion of these disruptions could materially adversely impact our operations and results. In addition to existing travel restrictions, jurisdictions may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity, which could significantly impact our ability to support our operations and customers and the ability of our employees to get to their workplaces to produce products and services, or significantly hinder our products from being sold to the end customer.\n\u2022The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may limit our ability to reduce our overall operating costs. We expect increased costs relating to our efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through enhanced sanitization procedures and social-distancing measures we have enacted and will likely continue to enact at our locations in an effort to protect our employees\u2019 health and well-being.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has not materially disrupted our supply chain at this time, however, the full impact of the outbreak on our supply chain could result in future disruptions. Should disruptions or our failure to effectively respond to them occur, it may increase product or distribution costs or cause delays in delivering or an inability to deliver products to our customers.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing, and has disrupted the capital markets and commercial paper markets. With the ongoing pandemic, volatility is likely to continue. We might not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like and our borrowing costs could increase.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has caused increased difficulty in determining the fair value of the Company\u2019s goodwill and other assets for accounting purposes given the level of judgment and estimation that is inherently higher in the current environment considering the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, which could result in estimates and assumptions made in valuing goodwill and other Company assets proving to be inaccurate in the future.\nWe may not be able to predict or respond to all impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on a timely basis to prevent near- or long-term adverse impacts to our results. Due to the speed with which the COVID-19 situation continues to develop, the breadth of its spread and the range of governmental and community reactions thereto, there is uncertainty around its duration and ultimate impact; therefore, any negative impact on our business, financial condition (including without limitation our liquidity), results of operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to extended disruption of economic activity and the impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be material.\nThe ultimate impact of these disruptions also depends on events beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by parties other than us to respond to them. The foregoing and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Annual Report, and any of these impacts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive. Failure to compete effectively against competitors could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nThe markets for RVs and marine products are very competitive. Competitive factors in the industry include price, design, value, quality, service, brand awareness, and reputation. There can be no assurance that existing or new competitors will not develop products that are superior to our products or that achieve better consumer acceptance, thereby adversely affecting our market share, sales volume, and profit margins. Some of our competitors are much larger than we are, and this size advantage provides these competitors with more financial resources and access to capital, additional purchasing power, and greater leverage with the dealer networks. In addition, competition could increase if new companies enter the market, existing competitors consolidate their operations, or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines. Our current products, products under development, and our ability to develop new and improved products may be insufficient to enable us to compete effectively with our competitors. These competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to identify, attract, and retain appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. Changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur ability to meet our strategic objectives and otherwise grow our business will depend to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our leadership team. Our future success will also depend in large part on our ability to identify, attract, and retain other highly qualified managerial, technical, sales and marketing, operations, and customer service personnel. Competition for these individuals in our manufacturing markets is intense and supply is limited. Since we operate in a competitive labor market, there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have an adverse effect on our business. We may not succeed in identifying, attracting, or retaining qualified personnel on a cost-effective basis. The loss or interruption of services of any of our key personnel, inability to identify, attract, or retain qualified personnel in the future, delays in hiring qualified personnel, or any employee work slowdowns, strikes, or similar actions could make it difficult for us to conduct and manage our business and meet key objectives, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur operations are primarily centered in northern IA and northern IN. Any disruption at these sites could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe currently manufacture most of our products in northern IA and northern IN. These facilities may be affected by natural or man-made disasters and other external events. In the event that one of our manufacturing facilities was affected by a disaster or other event, we could be forced to shift production to one of our other manufacturing facilities or to cease operations. Although we maintain insurance for damage to our property and disruption of our business from casualties, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses. Any disruption in our manufacturing capacity could have an adverse impact on our ability to produce sufficient inventory of our products or may require us to incur additional expenses in order to produce sufficient inventory, and therefore, may adversely affect our net sales and operating results. Any disruption or delay at our manufacturing facilities could impair our ability to meet the demands of our customers, and our customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe terms of our notes and other debt instruments could adversely affect our operating flexibility and pose risks of default.\nWe incurred substantial indebtedness to finance the acquisitions of Grand Design and Newmar Corporation (\"Newmar\"). Our ABL credit facility and senior secured notes are secured by substantially all of our assets, including cash, inventory, accounts receivable, and certain machinery and equipment. We also issued unsecured convertible notes to finance the acquisition of Newmar. If a default of payment occurs, the lenders in our ABL facility or holders of our senior secured and convertible notes may elect to declare all of their respective outstanding debt, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. Under such circumstances, we may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other corporate actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nBorrowing availability under the ABL credit facility is limited to the lesser of the facility total and the calculated borrowing base, which is based on stipulated loan percentages applied to our eligible trade accounts receivable and eligible inventories. Should the borrowing base decline, our ability to borrow to fund future operations and business transactions could be limited.\nIn addition, the senior secured notes contain certain occurrence based covenants that could restrict our ability to undertake certain types of transactions. If we enter into a transaction that falls under the occurrence based covenants, we will calculate the ratios and covenant buckets we have available to us to ensure we are in compliance. Likewise, the indenture related to the convertible notes issued to help finance the acquisition of Newmar includes certain limited covenants that could impact our ability to operate our business.\nIn addition, our indebtedness could:\n\u2022Make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic, regulatory, and industry conditions;\n\u2022Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in the markets in which we compete;\n\u2022Place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt; and\n\u2022Restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting other business opportunities.\nVarious factors, including share dilution, changes to credit terms, and our ability to meet financial performance expectations, could result in a decline in our stock price.\nOur stock price may fluctuate based on many factors. Our acquisition of Grand Design, for example, provided important strategic positioning and earnings growth potential, but to partially finance the transaction we issued $124.1 million worth of common stock to the owners of Grand Design and registered these shares for resale after the transaction closed. Similarly, we issued 2.0 million shares of our common stock to the owners of Newmar. In connection with our acquisition of Newmar, we also issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2025. We will settle conversions of the convertible notes by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, based on the applicable conversion rate(s). Any future stock issuance by us or liquidation of stock holding by the former owners of Grand Design or the former owners of Newmar may cause dilution of earnings per share or put selling pressure on our share price. Changing credit agreements may also impact stock price. In general, analysts' expectations and our ability to meet those expectations quarterly may cause stock price fluctuations. If we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, debt repayment, dividends, share issuance or repurchase, or other market expectations, our stock price may decline significantly.\nWe could be impacted by the potential adverse effects of union activities.\nAlthough none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union, unionization could result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. We are, directly or indirectly, dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or operating results. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, or financial condition.\nOur business may be sensitive to economic conditions, including those that impact consumer spending.\nCompanies within the RV and marine industries are subject to volatility in operating results due primarily to general economic conditions because the purchase of a RV or marine product is often viewed as a consumer discretionary purchase. Demand for discretionary goods in general can fluctuate with recessionary conditions, slow or negative economic growth rates, negative consumer confidence, reduced consumer spending levels resulting from tax increases or other factors, prolonged high unemployment rates, higher commodity and component costs, fuel prices, inflationary or deflationary pressures, reduced credit availability or unfavorable credit terms for dealers and end-user customers, higher short-term interest rates, and general economic and political conditions and expectations. Specific factors affecting the RV and marine industries include:\n\u2022Overall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending;\n\u2022Employment trends;\n\u2022The adverse impact of global tensions on consumer spending and travel-related activities; and\n\u2022The adverse impact on margins due to increases in raw material costs, which we are unable to pass on to customers without negatively affecting sales.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and trade names could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Our determination of whether goodwill impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units\u2019 fair value with its carrying value. Significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant and long-term adverse changes in business climate, unanticipated competition, and/or changes in technology or markets, could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could negatively impact our results of operations.\nCredit market deterioration and volatility may restrict the ability of our dealers and retail customers to finance the purchase of our products.\nOur business is affected by the availability and terms of the financing to dealers. Generally, RV and marine dealers finance their purchases of inventory with financing provided by lending institutions. One financial flooring institution held 33.0% of our total financed dealer inventory dollars that were outstanding at August 29, 2020. In the event that this lending institution limits or discontinues dealer financing, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is also affected by the availability and terms of financing to retail purchasers. Retail buyers purchasing one of our products may elect to finance their purchase through the dealership or a financial institution of their choice. Substantial increases in interest rates or decreases in the general availability of credit for our dealers or for the retail purchaser may have an adverse impact upon our business and results of operations.\nOur business is both cyclical and seasonal and is subject to fluctuations in sales and net income.\nThe RV and marine industries have been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand, reflecting prevailing economic and demographic conditions, which affect disposable income for leisure-time activities. Consequently, the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period.\nSeasonal factors, over which we have no control, also have an effect on the demand for our products. Demand in the RV and marine industries generally declines over the winter season, while sales are generally highest during the spring and summer months. Also, unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand.\nFailure to effectively manage strategic acquisitions and alliances, joint ventures, or partnerships could have a negative impact on our business.\nOne of our growth strategies is to drive growth through targeted acquisitions and alliances, stronger customer relations, and new joint ventures and partnerships that contribute profitable growth while supplementing our existing brands and product portfolio. Our ability to grow through acquisitions depends, in part, on the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices, terms, and conditions, our ability to compete effectively for acquisition candidates, and the availability of capital and personnel to complete such acquisitions and run the acquired business effectively. Any acquisition, alliance, joint venture, or partnership could impair our business, financial condition, reputation, and operating results. The benefits of an acquisition, including the Newmar Acquisition, or new alliance, joint venture, or partnership may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee that previous or future acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, or partnerships will, in fact, produce any benefits. Such acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and partnerships may involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022Diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022Disruption to our existing operations and plans;\n\u2022Inability to effectively manage our expanded operations;\n\u2022Difficulties or delays in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, operations, and products of an acquired business or other business venture or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings, and synergies;\n\u2022Inability to successfully integrate or develop a distribution channel for acquired product lines;\n\u2022Potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, or dealers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, customers, distributors, and dealers;\n\u2022Adverse impact on overall profitability, if our expanded operations do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation model;\n\u2022Inaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition or business venture investments, undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition or other business venture, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and\n\u2022Incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions, occurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill or other assets that could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to properly forecast future demand of our products, our production levels may not meet demands, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nOur ability to manage our inventory levels to meet our customer's demand for our products is important for our business. For example, certain dealers are focused on the rental market which spikes over the summer vacation period while other dealers are focused on direct sales to the consumer at various price points. Our production levels and inventory management are based on demand estimates six to twelve months forward taking into account supply lead times, production capacity, timing of shipments, and dealer inventory levels. If we overestimate or underestimate demand for any of our products during a given season, we may not maintain appropriate inventory levels, which could negatively impact our net sales or working capital, hinder our ability to meet customer demand, or cause us to incur excess and obsolete inventory charges.\nUnanticipated changes to our distribution channel customers' inventory levels could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe sell many of our products through distribution channels and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices. Our distribution channel customers carry inventories of our products as part of their ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs. Such adjustments may impact our inventory management and working capital goals as well as operating results. If the inventory levels of our distribution channel customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower\nthan the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our inventory management and working capital goals as well as our operating results.\nIf we are unable to continue to enhance existing products and develop and market new or enhanced products that respond to customer needs and preferences, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products and our business could suffer.\nOne of our growth strategies is to develop innovative, customer-valued products to generate revenue growth. We may not be able to compete as effectively with our competitors, and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of our customers, unless we can continue to enhance existing products and develop new innovative products for the markets in which we compete. Product development requires significant financial, technological, and other resources. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant research, planning, design, development, engineering, and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process levels, and we may not be able to timely develop and introduce product improvements or new products. Our competitors' new products may beat our products to market, be higher quality or more reliable, be more effective with more features and/or less expensive than our products, obtain better market acceptance, or render our products obsolete. Any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on, among other things, existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs, and research and development.\nThe loss of a large dealer organization could have a significant impact on our business.\nWhile none of our dealer organizations accounted for more than 10% of our Net revenues for Fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, the loss of a major dealer or multiple dealers could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In addition, deterioration in the liquidity or creditworthiness of a major dealer or multiple dealers could negatively impact our sales and could trigger repurchase obligations under our repurchase agreements.\nIf we are obligated to repurchase a substantially larger number of our products in the future than estimated due to dealer default, these purchases could result in adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIn accordance with customary practice in our industries, upon request we enter into formal repurchase agreements with lending institutions financing a dealer's purchase of our products. In these repurchase agreements we agree, in the event of a default by an independent dealer in its obligation to a lender and repossession of the unit(s) by the lending institution, to repurchase units at declining prices over the term of the agreements, which can last up to 24 months. The difference between the gross repurchase price and the price at which the repurchased product can then be resold, which is typically at a discount to the gross repurchase price, represents a potential expense to us. In certain instances, we also repurchase inventory from our dealers due to state law or regulatory requirements that govern voluntary or involuntary terminations. If we are obligated to repurchase a substantially larger number of units in the future than we estimate, this would increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nFor some of the components used in production, we depend on a small group of suppliers and the loss of any of these suppliers could affect our ability to obtain components timely or at competitive prices, which would decrease our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nMost of our RV and marine components are readily available from numerous sources. However, a few of our components are produced by a small group of suppliers. In the case of Motorhome chassis, Mercedes-Benz (USA and Canada), Freightliner Custom Chassis, and Chrysler of Forest City Inc. are our major suppliers. Our relationship with our chassis suppliers is similar to our other supplier relationships in that no specific contractual commitments are engaged in by either party. This means that we do not have minimum purchase requirements, and our chassis suppliers do not have minimum supply requirements. Our chassis suppliers also supply to our competitors. Historically, chassis suppliers resort to an industry-wide allocation system during periods when supply is restricted. These allocations have been based on the volume of chassis previously purchased, which could mean our larger competitors could receive more chassis in a time of scarcity. Sales of motorhomes rely on chassis supply and are affected by shortages from time to time. Decisions by our suppliers to decrease production, production delays or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers, or price increases could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce motorhomes and ultimately, on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In Fiscal 2020, none of our manufacturers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated raw material purchases.\nIncreases in raw material, commodity, and transportation costs and shortages of certain raw materials could negatively impact our business.\nWe purchase raw materials such as steel, aluminum, and other commodities, and components, such as chassis, refrigerators, and televisions, for use in our products. In addition, we are a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities, including steel, aluminum, copper, lead, rubber, and others that are integrated into our end products. Our profitability is affected by significant fluctuations in the prices of the raw materials and the components and parts we use in our products. Additionally, the current political landscape has introduced significant uncertainty with respect to future trade regulations and existing international trade agreements. The U.S. has initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods, including raw materials, commodities, and products\nmanufactured outside the U.S. that are used in our manufacturing processes, which has increased our cost of goods sold. In response, certain foreign governments have imposed tariffs on certain U.S. goods, and are considering imposing additional tariffs on other U.S. goods, including goods that we sell internationally. The tariffs imposed to date and the possibility of additional retaliatory trade actions stemming from these tariffs could continue to increase our cost of goods sold, both directly and as a result of price increases implemented by domestic suppliers, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. The impact from these tariffs could also result in decreased demand for our products. All of these could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, increases in other costs of doing business may also adversely affect our profit margins and businesses. For example, an increase in fuel costs may result in an increase in our transportation costs, which also could adversely affect our operating results and businesses. Historically, we have mitigated cost increases, in part, by collaborating with suppliers, reviewing alternative sourcing options, substituting materials, engaging in internal cost reduction efforts, and increasing prices on some of our products, all as appropriate. However, we may not be able to fully offset such increased costs in the future. Further, if our price increases are not accepted by our customers and the market, our net sales, profit margins, earnings, and market share could be adversely affected.\nSignificant product repair and/or replacement costs due to product warranty claims and product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe receive warranty claims from our dealers in the ordinary course of our business. Although we maintain reserves for such claims, which to date have been adequate, there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate. A significant increase in warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIn addition to the costs associated with the contractual warranty coverage provided on our products, we also occasionally incur costs as a result of additional service actions not covered by our warranties, including product recalls and customer satisfaction actions. Although we estimate and reserve for the cost of these service actions, there can be no assurance that expense levels will remain at current levels or such reserves will continue to be adequate.\nOur continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of our brands which, if impaired, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe believe that one of the strengths of our business is our brands, which are widely known around the world. We vigorously defend our brands and our other intellectual property rights against third parties on a global basis. We have, from time to time, had to bring claims against third parties to protect or prevent unauthorized use of our brand. If we are unable to protect and defend our brands or other intellectual property, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nIf the frequency and size of product liability and other claims against us increase, our reputation and business may be harmed.\nWe are subject, in the ordinary course of business, to litigation including a variety of warranty, \"Lemon Law,\" and product liability claims typical in the RV and marine industries. Although we have an insurance policy with a $50.0 million limit covering product liability, we are self-insured for the first $1.0 million of product liability claims on a per occurrence basis, with a $2.0 million aggregate per policy year. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any increase in the frequency and size of these claims, as compared to our experience in prior years, may cause the premium that we are required to pay for insurance to rise significantly. Product liability claims may also cause us to pay punitive damages, not all of which are covered by our insurance. In addition, if product liability claims rise to a level of frequency or size that are significantly higher than similar claims made against our competitors, our reputation and business may be harmed.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions, and breaches in data security that could adversely affect our business. In addition, the benefits of our new enterprise resource planning system may not be realized, or we may incur unanticipated costs or delays, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer.\nWe rely on our information systems and web applications to support our business operations, including but not limited to procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, warranty administration, invoicing, and collection of payments. We use information systems to report and audit our operational results. Additionally, we rely upon information systems in our sales, marketing, human resources, and communication efforts. Due to our reliance on our information systems, our business processes may be negatively impacted in the event of substantial disruption of service. Further, misuse, leakage, or falsification of information could result in a violation of privacy laws and damage our reputation which could, in turn, have a negative impact on our results.\nIn addition to our general reliance on information systems, we began implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system at the end of Fiscal 2015. Though we perform planning and testing to reduce risks associated with such a complex, enterprise-wide\nsystems change, failure to meet requirements of the business could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to suffer.\nFailure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the security or privacy of our customers', clients', or suppliers' confidential information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage, as well as litigation and enforcement actions.\nWe have security systems in place with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our customers', clients', and suppliers' confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through the misdirection, theft, or loss of physical media. These include, for example, the appropriate encryption of information. Despite such efforts, we are subject to breach of security systems which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities or the information we are trying to protect. Because the technologies used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly changing and becoming increasingly more sophisticated and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative measures. If unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems or such information is misdirected, lost, or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties, and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to certain government regulations that could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, and local regulations and the following summarizes some, but not all, of the laws and regulations that apply to us.\nFederal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards govern the design, manufacture and sale of our RV products, which standards are promulgated by the NHTSA. NHTSA requires manufacturers to recall and repair vehicles which are non-compliant with a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard or contain safety defects. In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard maintains certification standards for the manufacture of our marine products, and the safety of recreational boats in the U.S. is subject to federal regulation under the Boat Safety Act of 1971, which requires boat manufacturers to recall products for replacement of parts or components that have demonstrated defects affecting safety. Any major recalls of our products, voluntary or involuntary, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. While we believe we are in compliance with the foregoing laws and regulations as they currently exist, amendments to any of these regulations or the implementation of new regulations could significantly increase the cost of testing, manufacturing, purchasing, operating, or selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in federal fines being imposed on us, potential civil and criminal liability, suspension of sales or production, or cessation of operations.\nWe are also subject to federal and numerous state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale, transportation, and marketing of motor vehicles, including so-called \"Lemon Laws.\" Federal and state laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight, length, and width of motor vehicles, including motorhomes that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways. Certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions.\nFailure to comply with the New York Stock Exchange and SEC laws or regulations could also have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, amendments to these regulations and the implementation of new regulations could increase the cost of our operations and therefore could have an adverse impact on our business.\nFinally, federal and state authorities also have various environmental control standards relating to air, water, noise pollution, and hazardous waste generation and disposal that affect us and our operations. Failure by us to comply with present or future laws and regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, potential civil and criminal liability, suspension of production or operations, alterations to the manufacturing process, or costly cleanup or capital expenditures, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanging climate-related regulations may require us to incur additional costs in order to be in compliance.\nThere is growing concern from members of the scientific community and the general public that an increase in global average temperatures due to emissions of greenhouse gases (\"GHG\") and other human activities have or will cause significant changes in weather patterns and increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters. We are currently subject to rules limiting emissions and other climate related rules and regulations in certain jurisdictions where we operate. In addition, we may become subject to additional legislation and regulation regarding climate change, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly. Concerned parties, such as legislators, regulators, and non-governmental organizations, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions. Foreign, federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed various legislative and regulatory\nmeasures relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions, and energy policies. If such legislation is enacted, we could incur increased energy, environmental, and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the limitations. Climate change regulation combined with public sentiment could result in reduced demand for our products, higher fuel prices, or carbon taxes, all of which could materially adversely affect our business. Due to uncertainty in the regulatory and legislative processes, as well as the scope of such requirements and initiatives, we cannot currently determine the effect such legislation and regulation may have on our products and operations.\nCertain provisions that we are subject to may reduce the ability of a third-party to acquire us, even if beneficial to shareholders.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation, by-laws, the Iowa Business Corporation Act, and provisions in our credit agreements and certain of our compensation programs that we may enter into from time to time could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial by our shareholders. The combination of these provisions effectively inhibits a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Newmar Acquisition.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating the operations of Newmar into our business and in realizing the expected benefits of the Newmar Acquisition.\nThe success of the Newmar Acquisition, completed in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities from combining the operations of Newmar with our business in an efficient and effective manner. The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures, and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or other third parties, or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Newmar Acquisition, and could harm our financial performance. We cannot assure you that the Newmar business will perform as expected, that integration or other one-time costs will not be greater than expected, that we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities, or that the rate of return from the acquisition will justify our investment. We also incurred significant costs in connection with the Newmar Acquisition, the substantial majority of which are non-recurring expenses. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs in the integration of Newmar's business and may not achieve cost synergies and other benefits sufficient to offset the incremental costs of the Newmar Acquisition. If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of Newmar with our business, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the revenue growth, synergies, and other anticipated benefits resulting from the Newmar Acquisition, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Newmar Acquisition also involves risks associated with acquisitions and integrating acquired assets into existing operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, including, among others:\n\u2022failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;\n\u2022unanticipated issues in integrating equipment, logistics, information, communications, and other systems;\n\u2022possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, contracts, procedures, and policies;\n\u2022impacts of change in control provisions in contracts and agreements;\n\u2022failure to retain key customers and suppliers;\n\u2022unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022failure to recruit and retain key employees to operate the combined business;\n\u2022increased competition within the industries in which Newmar operates;\n\u2022difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex combined company;\n\u2022inherent operating risks in the business;\n\u2022unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities;\n\u2022additional reporting requirements pursuant to applicable rules and regulations;\n\u2022additional requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022diversion of our senior management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of the assets acquired in the acquisition of Newmar;\n\u2022significant unknown and contingent liabilities we incur for which we have limited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage;\n\u2022the assets to be acquired failing to perform as well as we anticipate; and\n\u2022unexpected costs, delays, and challenges arising from integrating the assets acquired in the Newmar Acquisition into our existing operations.\nEven if we successfully integrate the assets acquired in the Newmar Acquisition into our operations, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we anticipate or we may not realize these benefits within the expected time frame. If we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from the Newmar Acquisition, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nNewmar may have liabilities that are not known, probable, or estimable at this time.\nFollowing the acquisition of Newmar, Newmar became our subsidiary and it will remain subject to all of its liabilities. There could be unasserted claims or assessments that we failed or were unable to discover or identify in the course of performing due diligence investigations of Newmar. In addition, there may be liabilities that are neither probable nor estimable at this time that may become probable or estimable in the future. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nAdditionally, Newmar is subject to various rules, regulations, laws, and other legal requirements, enforced by governments or other public authorities. Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by any of Newmar\u2019s directors, officers, employees, or agents could have a significant impact on Newmar\u2019s business and reputation and could subject Newmar to fines and penalties and criminal, civil, and administrative legal sanctions, resulting in reduced revenues and profits.", "PERMNO": 51086, "SIC": 3790, "TIC": "WGO"}
