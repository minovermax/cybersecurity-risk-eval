{"cik": "91388", "company": "SMITHFIELD FOODS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risk factors below represent what we believe are the known material risk factors with respect to us and our business. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry, financial position or future financial results.\nOur results of operations are cyclical and could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the commodity prices for hogs and grains.\nWe are largely dependent on the cost and supply of hogs and feed ingredients and the selling price of our products and competing protein products, all of which are determined by constantly changing and volatile market forces of supply and demand as well as other factors over which we have little or no control. These other factors include:\n\u2022\ncompeting demand for corn for use in the manufacture of ethanol or other alternative fuels,\n\u2022\nenvironmental and conservation regulations,\n\u2022\nimport and export restrictions such as trade barriers resulting from, among other things, food safety concerns and developments in international relations,\n\u2022\neconomic conditions,\n\u2022\nweather, including the impact of weather on our water supply and the availability and pricing of grains,\n\u2022\nenergy prices, including the effect of changes in energy prices on our transportation costs and the cost of feed, and\n\u2022\ncrop and livestock diseases.\nWe cannot assure you that all or part of any increased costs experienced by us from time to time can be passed along to consumers of our products, in a timely manner or at all.\nHog prices demonstrate a cyclical nature over periods of years, changing market supply and demand of hogs on the market. These fluctuations can be significant, as shown in recent years, with average domestic live hog prices going from $61 per hundredweight for the twelve months ended April 28, 2013 to $79 per hundredweight in 2014. Further, hog raising costs are largely dependent on the fluctuations of commodity prices for corn and other feed ingredients. For example, our results of operations for the twelve months ended April 28, 2013 were negatively impacted by higher feed and feed ingredient costs which increased hog raising costs to $68 per hundredweight compared to $54 per hundred weight for the twelve months ended May 1, 2011. When hog prices are lower than our hog production costs which occurred in the twelve months ended April 28, 2013, our non-vertically integrated competitors (i.e., those without significant hog production operations) may have a cost advantage over us.\nAdditionally, commodity pork prices demonstrate a cyclical nature over periods of years, reflecting changes in the supply of fresh pork and competing animal proteins on the market, especially beef and chicken.\nWe attempt to manage certain of these risks through the use of our risk management and hedging programs. However, these programs may also limit our ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity fluctuations. Additionally, a portion of our commodity derivative contracts are marked-to-market such that the related unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings on a quarterly basis. This accounting treatment may cause significant volatility in our quarterly earnings. See \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Derivative Financial Instruments\u201d for further information.\nOutbreaks of disease among or attributed to livestock can significantly affect production, the supply of raw materials, demand for our products and our business.\nWe take precautions to ensure that our livestock are healthy and that our processing plants and other facilities operate in a sanitary manner. Nevertheless, we are subject to risks relating to our ability to maintain animal health and control diseases. Livestock health problems could adversely impact our production, our supply of raw materials and consumer confidence in all of our operating segments.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced outbreaks of livestock diseases and we may experience additional occurrences of disease in the future. Disease can reduce the number of offspring produced, hamper the growth of livestock to finished size, result in expensive vaccination programs and require in some cases the destruction of infected livestock, any of which could adversely affect our production or ability to sell or export our products. For example, during 2013, the USDA identified the first case of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv). See \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Overview-Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv)\u201d for additional details.\nAdverse publicity concerning any disease or health concern could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products, particularly as we expand our branded pork products. In addition to risks associated with maintaining the health of our livestock, any outbreak of disease elsewhere in the U.S. or in other countries could reduce consumer confidence in the meat products affected by the particular disease, generate adverse publicity, depress market conditions for our hogs internationally and/or domestically and result in the imposition of import or export restrictions.\nOutbreaks of disease among or attributed to livestock also may have indirect consequences that adversely affect our business. For example, past outbreaks of avian influenza in various parts of the world reduced the global demand for poultry and thus created a temporary surplus of poultry both domestically and internationally. This poultry surplus placed downward pressure on poultry prices, which in turn reduced meat prices including pork prices both in the U.S. and internationally. The occurrence of similar events in the future could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur operations are subject to the general risks associated with the food industry, including perceived or real health risks related to our products or the food industry generally and risks associated with government regulations.\nWe are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by the following:\n\u2022\nfood spoilage,\n\u2022\nfood contamination,\n\u2022\nfood allergens,\n\u2022\nevolving consumer preferences and nutritional and health-related concerns,\n\u2022\nconsumer product liability claims,\n\u2022\nproduct tampering,\n\u2022\nproduct labeling errors,\n\u2022\nthe expense and possible unavailability of product liability insurance, and\n\u2022\nthe potential cost and disruption of a product recall.\nNegative publicity relating to our products, brands, operations, industry or products similar to ours may adversely affect consumer perceptions of our products and result in decreased demand for our products. In particular, negative publicity relating to one of our 12 core brands may be particularly harmful since we face risks from brand concentration. Adverse publicity concerning any perceived or real health risk associated with our brands or our products could also cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products, which could adversely affect our ability to sell our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects, particularly as we expand our branded products business. We could also be adversely affected by perceived or real health risks associated with similar products produced by others to the extent such risks cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of such products generally and, therefore, lead customers to opt for other meat options that are perceived as safe. The A(H1N1) influenza outbreak that occurred in late fiscal 2009 and early fiscal 2010 illustrates the adverse impact that can result from perceived health risks associated with the products we sell. Although the CDC and other regulatory and scientific bodies indicated that people cannot get A(H1N1) influenza from eating cooked pork or pork products, the perception of some consumers that the disease could be transmitted in that manner was the apparent cause of the temporary decline in pork consumption in late fiscal 2009 and early fiscal 2010.\nOur products are susceptible to contamination by disease producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Campylobacter and generic E. coli. Because these organisms and pathogens are generally found in the environment, there is a risk that one or more, as a result of food processing, could be present in our products. We have systems in place designed to monitor food safety risks throughout all stages of our vertically integrated process. However, we cannot assure you that such systems, even when working effectively, will eliminate the risks related to food safety. These organisms and pathogens can also be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling in transportation or at the further processing, foodservice or consumer level. In addition to the risks caused by our processing operations and the subsequent handling of the products, we may encounter the same risks if any third party tampers with our products. We could be required to recall certain of our products in the event of contamination or adverse test results. Any product contamination also could subject us to product liability claims, adverse publicity and government scrutiny, investigation or intervention, resulting in increased costs and decreased sales as customers lose confidence in the safety and quality of our food products. Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur manufacturing facilities and products, including the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising and labeling of our products, are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations in the food safety area, including regular government inspections and governmental food processing controls. Loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results. If we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations, particularly if it relates to or compromises food safety, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, future material changes in food safety regulations could result in increased operating costs or could be required to be implemented on schedules that cannot be met without interruptions in our operations.\nEnvironmental regulation and related litigation and commitments could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur past and present business operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment, including among others:\n\u2022\nthe treatment and discharge of materials into the environment,\n\u2022\nthe handling and disposition of manure and solid wastes and\n\u2022\nthe emission of greenhouse gases.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, liability for damages and negative publicity. Some requirements applicable to us may also be enforced by citizen groups or other third parties. Natural disasters, such as flooding and hurricanes, can cause the discharge of effluents or other waste into the environment, potentially resulting in our being subject to further liability claims and governmental regulation as has occurred in the past. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation\u201d for further discussion of regulatory compliance as it relates to environmental risk. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations.\nWe also face the risk of lawsuits even if we are operating in compliance with applicable regulations. For example, 26 nuisance suits seeking recovery of an unspecified amount of compensatory, special and punitive damages, as well as unspecified injunctive and equitable relief are currently pending against our subsidiary Murphy-Brown in North Carolina. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings--North Carolina Nuisance Litigation\u201d for additional details. Although the Company believes that the claims are unfounded and intends to defend the suits vigorously, we cannot assure you that we will be successful, that additional nuisance claims will not arise in the future, or that the accruals for this litigation will not have to be substantially increased.\nIn addition, new environmental issues could arise that would cause currently unanticipated investigations, assessments or expenditures.\nGovernmental authorities may take further action restricting our ability to produce and/or sell livestock or adopt new regulations impacting our production or processing operations, which could adversely affect our business.\nA number of states, including Iowa and Missouri, have adopted legislation that prohibits or restricts the ability of meat packers, or in some cases corporations generally, from owning livestock or engaging in farming. In addition, Congress has in the past considered federal legislation that would ban meat packers from owning livestock. We cannot assure you that such or similar legislation affecting our operations will not be adopted at the federal or state levels in the future. Such legislation, if adopted and applicable to our current operations and not successfully challenged or settled, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and our financial statements.\nIn fiscal 2008, the State of North Carolina enacted a permanent moratorium on the construction of new hog farms using the lagoon and sprayfield system. The moratorium limits us from expanding our North Carolina production operations. This permanent moratorium replaced a 10-year moratorium on the construction of hog farms with more than 250 hogs or the expansion of existing large farms. This moratorium may over time lead to increased competition for contract growers.\nOur level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position.\nAs of December 28, 2014, we had:\n\u2022\napproximately $2.7 billion of indebtedness;\n\u2022\nguarantees of $7.7 million for leases that were transferred to JBS S.A. in connection with the sale of Smithfield Beef, Inc.; and\n\u2022\naggregate unused capacity available totaling approximately $1.3 billion under (1) our inventory based revolving credit facility with capacity up to $1.025 billion, with an option to expand up to $1.225 billion (the Inventory Revolver), (2) our accounts receivable securitization facility with capacity up to $325.0 million (the Securitization Facility) and (3) our other credit facilities with capacity of $122.0 million, such total taking into account outstanding borrowings of $50.1 million and $92.7 million of outstanding letters of credit under the Securitization Facility.\nBecause the borrowing capacity under the Inventory Revolver and Securitization Facility depend, in part, on inventory and accounts receivable levels, respectively, which fluctuate from time to time, such amounts may not reflect actual borrowing capacity.\nOur indebtedness may increase from time to time for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, working capital needs, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions or joint ventures. In addition, due to the volatile nature of the commodities markets, we may have to borrow significant amounts to cover any margin calls under our risk management and hedging programs. During 2014, margin deposits posted by us ranged from $7.1 million to $382.0 million. Our consolidated indebtedness level could significantly affect our business because:\n\u2022\nit may, together with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, limit or impair our ability in the future to obtain financing, refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and materially impair our liquidity,\n\u2022\na downgrade in our credit rating could restrict or impede our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase the cost of future borrowings,\n\u2022\nit may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise,\n\u2022\na portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to interest payments on our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes, which amount would increase if prevailing interest rates rise,\n\u2022\nsubstantially all of our working capital assets in the United States secure the Inventory Revolver and the Securitization Facility, all of which could limit our ability to dispose of such assets or utilize the proceeds of such dispositions and, upon an event of default under any such secured indebtedness, the lenders thereunder could foreclose upon our pledged assets, and\n\u2022\nit could make us more vulnerable to downturns in general economic or industry conditions or in our business.\nFurther, our debt agreements, under certain circumstances, may limit additional borrowings, investments, the payment of dividends, the acquisition or disposition of assets, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, the creation of liens and the repayment of certain debt.\nShould market conditions deteriorate, or our operating results be depressed in the future, we may have to request amendments or waivers to our covenants and restrictions under our debt agreements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such relief should it be needed in the future. A breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default that would permit our senior lenders, including lenders under the Inventory Revolver, the Securitization Facility, the Rabobank term loan (Rabobank Term Loan) and the holders of our senior unsecured notes, as the case may be, to declare all amounts outstanding under the Inventory Revolver, the Securitization Facility, the Rabobank Term Loan or the senior unsecured notes to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and the commitments of the relevant lenders to make further extensions of credit under the Inventory Revolver and the Securitization Facility could be terminated. If we were unable to repay our secured indebtedness to our lenders, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness, which could include substantially all of our working capital assets in the United States.\nOur future ability to comply with financial covenants and other conditions, make scheduled payments of principal and interest, or refinance existing borrowings depends on future business performance which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors, including the other risks set forth in this Item 1A. Any failure to comply with the covenants of our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur operations are subject to the risks associated with acquisitions and investments in joint ventures.\nFrom time to time we review opportunities for strategic growth through acquisitions. We have also pursued and may in the future pursue strategic growth through investment in joint ventures. These acquisitions and investments may involve large transactions or realignment of existing investments. These transactions present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention from managing our existing business,\n\u2022\ndifficulty with integrating businesses, operations, personnel and financial and other systems,\n\u2022\nlack of experience in operating in the geographical or product markets of the acquired business,\n\u2022\nincreased levels of debt potentially leading to associated reduction in ratings of our debt securities and adverse impact on our various financial ratios,\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we periodically review the value at which we carry our investments in joint ventures and, in the event we determine that the value at which we carry a joint venture investment has been impaired, the requirement to record a non-cash impairment charge, which charge could substantially affect our reported earnings in the period of such charge, would negatively impact our financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future,\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business,\n\u2022\nassumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired businesses,\n\u2022\npotential disputes with the sellers, and\n\u2022\nfor our investments, potential lack of common business goals and strategies with, and cooperation of, our joint venture partners.\nIn addition, acquisitions outside the U.S. may present unique difficulties and increase our exposure to those risks associated with international operations.\nWe may experience financial or other set-backs if any of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future have problems of which we are not aware or liabilities that exceed expectations.\nOur numerous equity investments in joint ventures, partnerships and other entities, both within and outside the U.S., are periodically involved in modifying and amending their credit facilities and loan agreements. The ability of these entities to refinance or amend their facilities on a successful and satisfactory basis, and to comply with the covenants in their financing facilities, affects our assessment of the carrying value of any individual investment. As of December 28, 2014, none of our equity investments represented more than 5% of our total consolidated assets. If we determine in the future that an investment is impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could substantially affect our reported earnings in the period of such charge. In addition, any such impairment charge would negatively impact our financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future. See \u201cItem 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 5: Investments\u201d for a discussion of the accounting treatment of our equity investments.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations.\nSales to international customers accounted for approximately 23% of our net sales in 2014. We conduct foreign operations in Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom and export our products to more than 40 countries. In addition, we are engaged in joint ventures in Mexico and have a significant investment in Western Europe. As of December 28, 2014, approximately 16% of our long-lived assets were associated with our foreign operations. Because of the growing market share of U.S. pork products in the international markets, U.S. exporters are increasingly being affected by measures taken by importing countries to protect local producers.\nOur international sales, operations and investments are subject to various risks related to economic or political uncertainties including among others:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions,\n\u2022\nimposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protection measures imposed by foreign countries,\n\u2022\nimport or export licensing requirements imposed by various foreign countries,\n\u2022\nthe closing of borders by foreign countries to the import of our products due to, among other things, animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues,\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with complying with, and enforcing remedies under, a wide variety of complex domestic and international laws, treaties and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory structures and unexpected changes in regulatory environments,\n\u2022\ntax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation,\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws, and\n\u2022\ndistribution costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation.\nFurthermore, our foreign operations are subject to the risks described above as well as additional risks and uncertainties including among others:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency values, which have affected, among other things, the costs of our investments in foreign operations,\n\u2022\ntranslation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, and\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange controls.\nNegative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur operations are subject to the general risks of litigation.\nWe are involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving consumers, shareholders, employees or injured persons, and claims related to commercial, labor, employment, antitrust, securities or environmental matters. Moreover, the process of litigating cases, even if we are successful, may be costly, and may approximate the cost of damages sought. These actions could also expose us to adverse publicity, which might adversely affect our brands, reputation and/or customer preference for our products and distract management from other tasks. Litigation trends and expenses and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends, expenses and outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe depend on availability of, and satisfactory relations with, our employees.\nAs of December 28, 2014, we had approximately 48,240 employees, 18,747 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions. Our operations depend on the availability, retention and relative costs of labor and maintaining satisfactory relations with employees and the labor unions. Further, employee shortages can and do occur, particularly in rural areas where some of our operations are located. Labor relations issues arise from time to time, including issues in connection with union efforts to represent employees at our plants and with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements. If we fail to maintain satisfactory relations with our employees or with the labor unions, we may experience labor strikes, work stoppages or other labor disputes. Negotiation of collective bargaining agreements also could result in higher ongoing labor costs. In addition, the discovery by us or governmental authorities of undocumented workers, as has occurred in the past, could result in our having to attempt to replace those workers, which could be disruptive to our operations or may be difficult to do.\nImmigration reform continues to attract significant attention in the public arena and the U.S. Congress. If new immigration legislation is enacted, such laws may contain provisions that could increase our costs in recruiting, training and retaining employees and increase our costs of complying with federal law in reviewing employees' immigration status. Furthermore, increased enforcement efforts with respect to existing immigration laws by governmental authorities may disrupt a portion of our workforce or our operations.\nThere can be no assurance that these activities or consequences will not adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects in the future.\nThe continued consolidation of customers could negatively impact our business.\nOur ten largest customers represented approximately 27% of net sales for 2014. We do not have long-term sales agreements (other than to certain third-party hog customers) or other contractual assurances as to future sales to these major customers. In addition, continued consolidation within the retail industry, including among supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, has resulted in an increasingly concentrated retail base and increased our credit exposure to certain customers. Our business could be materially adversely affected and suffer significant set-backs in sales and operating income from the loss of some of our larger customers or if our larger customers' plans, markets, and/or financial condition should change significantly.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nGoodwill is recorded at fair value and is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to management's judgment in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill recoverability. Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of the fair value of reporting units based on market multiples of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and/or on the estimated present value of future cash flows. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or market capitalization declines.\nImpairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods of such charges. In addition, impairment charges would negatively impact our financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future. As of December 28, 2014, we had $1.6 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 16% of total assets.\nDeterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, availability of and access to capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges) and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions.\nAny such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials, cooking ingredients and packaging materials, thereby negatively affecting our financial results.\nDisruptions and instability in credit and other financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions, could, among other things:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our debt in the future;\n\u2022\ncause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and make more difficult or expensive the granting of any technical or other waivers under our credit agreements to the extent we may seek them in the future;\n\u2022\nimpair the financial condition of some of our customers, suppliers or counterparties to our derivative instruments, thereby increasing customer bad debts, non-performance by suppliers or counterparty failures negatively impacting our treasury operations;\n\u2022\nnegatively impact global demand for our products, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022\ndecrease the value of our investments in equity and debt securities, including our company-owned life insurance and pension plan assets, which could result in higher pension cost and statutorily mandated funding requirements; and\n\u2022\nimpair the financial viability of our insurers.", "PERMNO": 70923, "SIC": 2013, "TIC": "0173A"}
