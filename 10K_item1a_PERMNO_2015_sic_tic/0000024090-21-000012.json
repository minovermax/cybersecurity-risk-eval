{"cik": "24090", "company": "CITIZENS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a discussion of material factors that may make an investment in Citizens' Class A common stock risky. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this report. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Part II. Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 15\nCITIZENS, INC.\nA SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM INSURANCE PRODUCTS SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. WHILE OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRICED AND PAID FOR IN U.S. DOLLARS, OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS MAY SUBJECT US TO SEVERAL RISKS, SET FORTH BELOW.\nOur sales to residents of foreign countries expose us to unknown risks related to foreign economies and governments. A significant loss of sales in these foreign markets would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA substantial majority of our direct insurance premiums, approximately 71% at December 31, 2020, are from policyholders in foreign countries, primarily those in Latin America and the Pacific Rim. These policies are issued by our Bermuda subsidiary, CICA Ltd. and are sold by independent consultants who are located in these foreign countries.\nOur Company\u2019s sales and financial results depend upon the ability of our independent consultants in foreign countries to effectively distribute our products and the ability of residents of such countries to purchase our products using U.S. dollars. While we have undertaken a comprehensive compliance review of risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws, which vary by country, to our sales of insurance policies in foreign countries, there is a lack of uniform regulation and lack of clarity in certain regulations and thus we face various risks associated with the application of foreign laws to these sales.\nGenerally, all foreign countries in which we offer insurance products require either CICA Ltd. and/or our independent consultants to obtain a license or other authority to conduct insurance business in that country. Some of these countries also require that local regulatory authorities approve the terms of any insurance product sold to residents of that country. We have never sought to qualify to do business in any foreign country or jurisdiction, except Bermuda, in which CICA Ltd. is domiciled, and have never submitted the insurance policies that we issue to residents of foreign countries for approval by any foreign or domestic insurance regulatory agency. Some foreign governments have determined under their existing laws that their residents may not purchase life insurance from us unless we become qualified to do business in that country or unless our policies purchased by their residents receive prior approval from its insurance regulators. There is a risk that additional foreign governments will enact additional legislation that may render our existing insurance products either illegal or less attractive to potential customers. There is the further risk that regulators may become more aggressive in enforcing any perceived violations of their laws and seek to impose monetary fines, criminal penalties, and/or order us to cease our sales in that jurisdiction. There is no assurance that, if a foreign country were to require that we qualify to do business in that country or submit our policies for approval by that country\u2019s regulatory authorities, we would be able to, or would conclude that it is advisable to, comply with those requirements. Any determination by a foreign country that we or our policy sales are subject to regulation under their laws, or any actions by a foreign country to enforce such laws more aggressively, could therefore have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell policies in that country and, in turn, on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTraditionally, we have sought to mitigate risks associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in our foreign markets by, among other things, not locating any of our offices or assets in foreign countries or jurisdictions, selling policies only through independent consultants rather than our own employees, requiring that all applications for insurance be submitted to and accepted only in our offices in the U.S. or, following the novation of our international policies to CICA Ltd. in Bermuda effective July 1, 2018, in our offices in Bermuda, and requiring that policy premiums be paid to us only in U.S. dollars. We rely on our independent consultants to comply with laws applicable to them in marketing our insurance products in their respective countries. There is no assurance that the precautionary measures, practices and policies discussed above will partially or entirely mitigate the risk associated with the potential application of foreign laws to our sales of insurance policies in our foreign markets. From time to time, insurance regulators in the foreign countries in which we operate have sought to exercise regulatory authority over the Company, including through the imposition of fines and we have chosen not to do business in certain countries, such as Brazil, due to these actions. Although the Company believes that these foreign regulators do not have jurisdiction over the Company and that any actions, including fines, may be unenforceable against the Company, any regulatory action could otherwise absorb Company time and resources away from its business operations or the Company may choose to pay such fines in order to do business in a particular country. The Company may determine that the risks associated with a particular market and its regulatory environment outweigh the benefits of conducting further business in that market. We are exploring alternatives to our current business model in one or more jurisdictions.\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 16\nCITIZENS, INC.\nAny disruption to the marketing and sale of our policies to residents of foreign countries, resulting from the actions of foreign regulatory authorities, the withdrawal from Brazil or other markets, the implementation of new Bermuda regulatory obligations or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our premium revenue and our costs and expenses and thus on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, currency control laws, other currency exchange restrictions or tax laws in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our revenues by imposing restrictions or additional fees, costs or taxes on asset transfers outside of a country where our policyowners reside. Difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies to U.S. dollars in certain countries or any increase in fees, costs or taxes associated therewith could prevent our policyowners in those countries from purchasing or paying premiums on our policies and/or make our products less attractive to such policyowners. As such, existing or future laws and regulations, and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nMany of the countries in which we operate have a history of political instability, including regime changes, political uprisings, currency fluctuations and anti-democratic or anti-U.S. policies. The ability of people living in these countries to purchase and continue to make premium payments on our insurance policies and our ability to sell our policies in those countries through our independent consultants or otherwise may be adversely affected by political instability. Given the nature of our products, in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment, lower personal income and reduced consumer spending, new product sales may be adversely affected. During such periods, we may also experience higher claims incidence, longer claims duration, increase in policy lapses and/or increase in surrenders, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the imposition of U.S. sanctions against foreign countries where our policyholders reside could make it difficult for us to continue to issue new policies and receive premiums from policyholders in those countries.\nWe face significant competition in our international markets. If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business, results of operations and profitability may be adversely affected.\nOur international marketing plan focuses on offering U.S. dollar-denominated life insurance products to individuals residing in foreign countries. We experience considerable competition primarily from the following sources, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have:\n\u2022Foreign companies with U.S. dollar-denominated policies. We face direct competition from companies that operate in the same manner as we do in our international markets, including from a company recently formed by some of our former employees and independent consultants;\n\u2022Foreign companies with locally operated subsidiaries that offer both local jurisdiction-regulated products in local currency and off-shore U.S. dollar-denominated policies. This arrangement creates competition in that the U.S. dollar-denominated policies are offered in conjunction with high-need local insurance policies such as health insurance; and\n\u2022Locally operated companies with local currency policies. We compete with companies formed and operated in the country in which our foreign insureds reside.\nIn addition, from time to time, companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition at times when there are new entrants. We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons.\nSince we rely on independent consultants for distribution of our products in foreign markets, regulation and licensing requirements imposed upon our Company may impact on our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives, who may choose to distribute products of our competitors.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in any of our markets. If we do not, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nWe face a greater risk of money laundering activity associated with sales derived from residents of certain foreign countries.\nSome of our top international markets are in countries identified by the U.S. Department of State as jurisdictions of high risk for money laundering. As required by the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act regulations, the Bermuda Proceeds of\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 17\nCITIZENS, INC.\nCrime Act 1997 and the Proceeds of Crime (Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing) Regulations 2008 applicable to insurance companies, we have developed and implemented an anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing and sanctions program (\u201cAML/ATF and Sanctions Program\u201d) that includes policies, procedures, controls, independent testing, reporting and recordkeeping requirements for deterring, preventing and detecting potential money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and other criminal activity in order to comply with U.S. and Bermuda laws. We have an enhanced AML/ATF and Sanctions Program with additional controls, such as watch-list screening beyond sanctions screening required by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") and the Financial Sanctions Implementation Unit of Bermuda, enhanced payment due diligence and transaction controls. However, there can be no assurance that these enhanced controls will entirely mitigate money laundering risk associated with these jurisdictions.\nBECAUSE MOST OF OUR REVENUE DERIVES FROM COLLECTION OF PREMIUMS ON OUR PRODUCTS, OUR OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON THE PRICING OF OUR INSURANCE PRODUCTS AND THE ACCURACY OF OUR PRICING ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE, IMPROPER EVALUATION OF UNDERWRITING RISK AND MISMANAGEMENT OF CLAIMS HANDLING COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR BENEFIT AND EXPENSE COSTS AND THUS NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to accurately underwrite risks and to charge adequate premiums to policyholders.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations largely depend on the Company\u2019s ability to underwrite and set premiums accurately for the risks it faces. Premium rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses, underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. In order to price its products accurately, the Company must implement and modify, as needed, underwriting standards that analyze a substantial volume of data; develop and apply appropriate morbidity and mortality estimates; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. The Company must also review and properly underwrite applications for life insurance in order to charge a sufficient premium to its policyholders. The Company\u2019s ability to undertake these efforts successfully is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:\n\u2022availability of sufficient reliable data;\n\u2022incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data;\n\u2022uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies;\n\u2022adoption of successful pricing strategies;\n\u2022prediction of policyholder retention (e.g., policy life expectancy);\n\u2022unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action;\n\u2022changes in the Company\u2019s claim settlement practices; or\n\u2022unexpected inflation.\nSuch risks may result in the Company\u2019s pricing being based on outdated, inadequate, or inaccurate data, or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause the Company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, the Company could underprice risks, which would negatively affect the Company\u2019s margins, or it could overprice risks, which could reduce the Company\u2019s volume and competitiveness. The Company\u2019s ability to accurately underwrite risks in insurance products depends in part on its ability to forecast such changes and trends. If it is not successful in doing so, the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.\nPricing adequacy depends upon our ability to project future losses based on historical loss experience, including policyholder retention. Unanticipated increases in early policyholder withdrawals or surrenders or elections by policyholders to receive lump sum payouts at maturity could negatively impact liquidity.\nA primary liquidity concern is the risk of unanticipated or extraordinary early policyholder withdrawals or surrenders. Our insurance policies include provisions, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals. We also track and manage liabilities and align our investment portfolio to maintain sufficient liquidity to support anticipated withdrawal demands. However, early withdrawal and surrender levels may differ from anticipated levels for a variety of reasons, including changes in economic conditions, changes in policyholder\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 18\nCITIZENS, INC.\nbehavior or financial needs, changes in relationships with our independent consultants, efforts by foreign governments to tax policyholders or increases in surrenders among policies that have been in force for more than fifteen years and are no longer subject to surrender charges.\nIn addition, we face potential liquidity risks if policyholders with mature policies elect to receive lump sum distributions at greater levels than anticipated. Our whole life and endowment products provide the policyholder with alternatives once the policy matures. The policyholder can choose to take a lump sum payout or leave the money on deposit at interest with the Company. The Company has a significant amount of aging endowment products that have begun reaching their maturities and policyholder election behavior is not known. It is uncertain how policyholders will react in response to these maturities. If a large number of policyholders elect lump sum distributions, the Company could be exposed to liquidity risk in years of high maturities.\nIf we experience unanticipated early withdrawal or surrender activity or greater than expected lump sum distributions of endowment maturities and we do not have sufficient cash flow from our insurance operations to support payment of these benefits, we may have to sell our investments in order to meet our cash needs or be forced to obtain third-party financing. The availability of such financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the availability of credit in general or more specifically in the insurance industry, the strength or weakness of the capital markets, the volume of trading activities, our credit capacity, and the perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large realized or unrealized investment losses or if the level of business activity declines due to a market downturn. Therefore, if we are forced to sell our investments on unfavorable terms or obtain financing with unfavorable terms, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur largest expense is payments of claims and surrenders to our policyholders. Mismanagement of claims handling or increased fraudulent claims could negatively impact our costs and financial condition.\nProper claims handling is critical to managing our benefit expenses. Many factors can affect the Company\u2019s ability to pay claims accurately, including the following:\n\u2022the training, experience, and skill of the Company\u2019s claims representatives;\n\u2022the extent of fraudulent claims and the Company\u2019s ability to recognize and respond to such claims;\n\u2022the claims organization\u2019s culture and the effectiveness of its management, and\n\u2022the Company\u2019s ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies, and systems to support claims functions.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and the Company\u2019s reputation in the marketplace, impair its brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect its competitiveness, financial results, prospects, and liquidity.\nHigher than expected policyholder claims related to unforeseen events may increase our benefits and expense costs, increase our reinsurance costs and negatively affect our financial condition.\nOur insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and man-made catastrophes may produce significant damage or loss of life in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. Claims resulting from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. In 2020, three major hurricanes caused significant damage in Louisiana, for which we paid a total of $1.2 million in claims, net of reinsurance. Additionally, we had to pay to increase our reinsurance coverage to cover an additional storm. These storms negatively impacted the results of operations in our Home Services Insurance segment during the second half of 2020. In addition, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of issuers of obligations we hold in our investment portfolio, resulting in impairments to these investments, and the financial condition of our reinsurers, thereby increasing the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. Large-scale catastrophes may also reduce the overall level of economic activity in affected countries, which could hurt our business and the value of our investments or our ability to sell new policies.\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 19\nCITIZENS, INC.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic is negatively impacting certain aspects of our business and, depending on severity and duration, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and overall business operations.\nThe prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to the global economy and business operations and has resulted in unfavorable impacts to our Company as well as the insurance industry. Due to the unprecedented nature of these events and the uncertainty surrounding the virus and its impacts, we cannot fully estimate the duration or full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at this time. However, we have identified several areas where the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business during the year ended December 31, 2020. Events that we are unable to control, such as the spread of a new, more contagious strain of the coronavirus, spikes in the number of cases of COVID-19, slower than expected roll-out of the coronavirus vaccine and the related responses by government authorities and businesses, may continue to present unforeseen risks to our business. We are closely monitoring developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its impacts on our business.\nAs discussed in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources, our liquidity requirements are met primarily by funds generated by our insurance subsidiaries and invested assets. In 2020, we experienced declines in premium income resulting from lower sales. Increased economic uncertainty or continued unemployment resulting from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 virus could continue to affect our premium revenues as policyholders may not be able to pay premiums on existing policies and potential customers may not purchase new policies in order to conserve cash. We have offered relief to policyholders (e.g. extending grace periods), which may negatively impact our operating cash flow. Historically, many of our policies have been sold via in-person meetings. Due to stay-at-home orders and limitations on interpersonal interactions, the lack of face-to-face meetings has negatively impacted sales and may continue to do so if the measures that we have put in place to encourage virtual selling prove to be ineffective. Additionally, due to these limitations as well as disruptions to international mail delivery to and from the United States, policyholders that mail in their premiums have had, and may continue to have, difficulty paying premiums. Unfavorable developments in any of these factors may adversely affect our liquidity and capital position.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has increased death claim benefits in our Home Service Insurance segment. We may experience continued increased claims, thus increasing our expected death benefits, if there continues to be an unusually large number of deaths.\nDuring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its effect on financial markets, adversely affected our investment portfolio (and, specifically, increased the risk of defaults, downgrades and volatility in the value of the investments we hold and lowered investment income) and may continue to do so. Extreme market volatility may continue to leave us unable to react to market events consistent with our historical practices in dealing with more stable markets. To the extent that we need to sell our investments to fund liquidity needs in the current financial markets, we may not receive the prices we seek, and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value.\nOur risk management, contingency and business continuity plans may not adequately protect our operations. Extended periods of remote work arrangements and other unusual business conditions and circumstances as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, increase our cybersecurity risks, and impair our ability to manage our business. The frequency and sophistication of attempts at unauthorized access to our technology systems and fraud may increase, and COVID-19 conditions may impair our cybersecurity efforts and risk management. Our efforts to prevent money-laundering or other fraud, whether due to limited abilities to \"know our customers\" or otherwise, may increase our compliance costs and risk of violations.\nWhile governmental and non-governmental organizations are continuing to engage in efforts to combat the spread and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health issues, these measures may not be effective. We also cannot predict how legal and regulatory responses to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health issues will impact our business. Such events or conditions could result in additional regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our business in the future.\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 20\nCITIZENS, INC.\nOur actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, and we may be required to establish additional reserves, which in turn may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe maintain reserves to cover our estimated exposure for claims relating to our issued insurance policies. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our best estimates using actuarial and statistical procedures. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops, and adjustments to reserves are reflected in our statements of operations for the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, future developments may require us to increase policy benefit reserves, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the periods in which such increases occur.\nWe may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, which would increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $104.9 million of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC. DAC represents costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful sale and issuance of our insurance policies and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies. These costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions, solicitation and printing costs, sales material costs and some support costs, such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses. Under U.S. GAAP for our type of insurance products, DAC is amortized over the premium-paying period of the policies.\nThe amortization of DAC is subject to acceleration and generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, persistency and maintenance expense margins. For example, if our insurance policies lapse and surrender rates were to exceed the assumptions upon which we priced our insurance policies, or if actual persistency proves to be less than our persistency assumptions, especially in the early years of a policy, we might be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the issuance of the policy. We regularly review the quality of our DAC to determine if it is recoverable from future income. If these costs are not recoverable, the amount that is not recoverable is charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination.\nUnfavorable experience with regards to expected expenses, investment returns, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, lapses or persistency may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or to record a current period expense to increase benefit reserves, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS REDUCES OUR CONTROL OVER SALES AND DISTRIBUTION AND THUS SUBJECTS US TO CERTAIN RISKS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES, OUR IN-FORCE BUSINESS, AND OUR BENEFITS AND EXPENSE COSTS.\nSales of our insurance products could decline if we are unable to establish and maintain relationships with independent marketing agencies and independent consultants and agents.\nWe depend almost exclusively on the services of independent marketing agencies and independent consultants and agents for the distribution of our products. These agencies, agents and consultants are key to the development and maintenance of our relationships with our policyholders. Significant competition exists among insurers in attracting and maintaining marketers of demonstrated ability. Some of our competitors may offer better compensation packages or commissions for marketing firms, independent consultants and agents or induce agents to sell their products through a broader product offering, more distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower cost structures and greater financial strength or claims paying ratings than we have. We compete with other insurers for marketing agencies, agents and independent consultants primarily on the basis of our compensation, products and support services. Any reduction in our ability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 21\nCITIZENS, INC.\nThere may be adverse tax, legal or financial consequences if our sales representatives are determined not to be independent consultants.\nOur sales representatives are independent consultants who operate their own businesses. Although we believe that we have properly classified our representatives as independent consultants, there is nevertheless a risk that the IRS, a foreign agency, a court or other authority will take the different view that our sales representatives should be classified as employees. The tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent consultant or an employee are typically fact-sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent sales representatives are subject to change or interpretation.\nIf there is a change in the manner in which our independent consultants are classified or an adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent consultants by a court or governmental agency, we could incur significant costs in complying with such laws and regulations, including in respect of tax withholding, social security payments, government and private pension plan contributions and recordkeeping, or we may be required to modify our business model, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is the risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable federal, state, local or foreign laws.\nINSURANCE IS A HIGHLY REGULATED BUSINESS. REGULATIONS VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION AND MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME. THESE REGULATIONS AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND CHANGES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR CASH FLOW, THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS, OUR LIQUIDITY AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITIONS.\nLEGAL REGULATION AND RISKS\nCitizens is a holding company that has minimal operations of its own and depends on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make payments to us in sufficient amounts to fund our operations. Our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by applicable laws and regulations in the amounts of payments they may make to us and their ability to transfer funds to us may be impaired by adverse financial results or a change in capital requirements. Accordingly, internal sources of capital and liquidity may not always be sufficient. If we need to seek external capital, adverse market conditions may affect our access to capital or our cost of capital.\nAs a holding company, our assets consist of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, cash and investments. We rely primarily on statutorily permissible payments from our insurance company subsidiaries, principally through service agreements we have with our subsidiaries, to meet our working capital needs. The ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to make payments to us is subject to regulation by the states and jurisdictions in which they are domiciled, and these payments depend primarily on approved service agreements between us and these subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, the statutory surplus (which is the excess of assets over liabilities as determined under statutory accounting practices prescribed by an insurance company's state of domicile), future statutory earnings (which are earnings as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices) and regulatory restrictions.\nExcept to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries' creditors, including policyholders, have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries over the claims of creditors (including us) and shareholders. If any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, our policyholders will have a priority to receive the assets of such subsidiary and we may have no rights with respect to the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under applicable laws.\nIf our financial results are unfavorable, we may need to increase our capital in order to satisfy regulatory requirements. Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus is considered important not only by us but by insurance regulatory authorities in the U.S. and Bermuda. Failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny or action by regulatory authorities. The need for additional capital may limit a subsidiary's ability to distribute funds to us.\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 22\nCITIZENS, INC.\nAdditionally, any change in demand for our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact their cash flows from operations. Deterioration in the credit market, which could delay our and our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 ability to sell positions in certain fixed maturity securities in a timely manner, could also negatively impact our and our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 cash flows. Regulatory changes such as those discussed herein in this Item 1A may impose higher capital or reserve requirements on our insurance subsidiaries and/or implement other requirements which could unfavorably affect our liquidity. Without sufficient liquidity, our ability to maintain and grow our operations would be limited. If our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may be unable to successfully obtain additional financing and capital on favorable terms, or at all, which may adversely affect us.\nObtaining financing for even a small amount of capital could be challenging in unfavorable market conditions and during periods of economic uncertainty. The markets may exert downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. The availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, and the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities take negative actions against us. Raising capital in unfavorable market conditions could increase our interest expense or negatively impact our shareholders through increased dilution of their common stock in the Company.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and any failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements in both the U.S. and internationally, as described below. If we fail to meet these standards and requirements, our various regulators may require specified actions to be taken, which could have a material and adverse impact on the Company\u2019s competitiveness, operational flexibility, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCICA Ltd. is subject to extensive supervision and regulation by the BMA and the Ministry of Finance of Bermuda (\u201cMOF\u201d). Failure to comply with regulation by the BMA and the MOF may increase our costs of doing business, restrict the conduct of our business and negatively impact our financial position or results of operations.\nCICA Ltd. was registered in Bermuda under the Insurance Act as a Class E insurer in February 2018 and is now subject to the provisions of the Insurance Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. We have limited experience with regulation by the BMA and the MOF, including compliance with common reporting standard regulations imposed by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, administered by the MOF, the jurisdiction's competent authority. Failure to comply with laws and regulations in Bermuda could subject us to monetary penalties imposed by the BMA and the MOF, increased regulatory supervision, unanticipated costs associated with remedying such failure or other claims, harm to our reputation and interruption of our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nAdditionally, as discussed in Item 1. Business - International Regulation - Bermuda, due to the Prudential Review, the BMA is requiring Citizens and CICA Ltd. to enter into a \u201cKeepwell Agreement\u201d, which would encumber certain assets of the Company. The Keepwell Agreement will include a specific target solvency level at which the Company would be required to make a capital injection into CICA Ltd. Both the Keepwell Agreement and any capital injection could negatively impact the Company\u2019s capital resources and liquidity.\nWe and our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the U.S. which is subject to change and may increase our costs of doing business, restrict the conduct of our business, increase capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries and negatively impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe and our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in U.S. jurisdictions where we do business, including state insurance regulations and U.S. federal securities, tax, financial services, privacy, anti-money laundering, bank secrecy, anti-corruption and foreign asset control laws. Insurance company regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, with substantially lesser protections to shareholders of the regulated insurance companies. To that end, all the U.S. states in which we do business have insurance regulatory agencies with broad legal powers with respect to licensing companies to transact business;\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 23\nCITIZENS, INC.\nmandating capital and surplus requirements; regulating trade and claims practices; approving policy forms; restricting companies' ability to enter and exit markets; and restricting or prohibiting the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us.\nThe capacity for an insurance company's growth in premiums is partially a function of its required statutory surplus. Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus, as measured by statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by a company's state of domicile, is considered important by all U.S. state insurance regulatory authorities. Failure to maintain required levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action by regulatory authorities.\nMost U.S. insurance regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, suspend and revoke licenses and approvals, and could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities, including acquisitions of other insurance companies, require us to add capital to our insurance company subsidiaries, or fine us. If we are unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals, or if our insurance business is determined not to comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations and their interpretations, including the USA Patriot Act, our revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFINANCIAL REGULATION AND RISKS\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be affected if the liabilities actually incurred differ, or if our estimates of those liabilities change, from the amounts we have reserved for in connection with missed tax reporting or noncompliance of some of our products with the Internal Revenue Code.\nWe have previously reported that a portion of the life insurance policies issued by our subsidiary insurance companies failed to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment afforded by Sections 7702/72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") of 1986. We have determined the structure of our policies sold to non-U.S. persons, which were novated to CICA Ltd. effective July 1, 2018, may have inadvertently generated U.S. source income over time, which caused tax withholding and information reporting requirements for the Company under Chapters 3 and 4 of the IRC.\nAccruals for loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The process of determining our best estimate and the estimated range for probable liabilities and expenses related to these tax issues was a complex undertaking including insight from external consultants and involved management\u2019s judgment based upon a variety of factors known at the time. The amount of our liabilities and expenses depends on a number of uncertainties, including the number of prior tax years for which we may be liable to the IRS and the methodology applicable to the calculation of the tax liabilities for policies. Given the range of potential outcomes and the significant variables assumed in establishing our estimates, actual amounts incurred may exceed our reserve and could exceed the high end of our estimated range of liabilities and expenses. To the extent the amount reserved by the Company is insufficient to meet the actual amount of our liabilities and expenses, or if our estimates of those liabilities and expenses change in the future, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. See Note 7. Commitment and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of such tax issues.\nChanges in accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nOur consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP in the U.S. and Bermuda which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB, the BMA and the NAIC. Future accounting standards we adopt, including the FASB\u2019s Accounting Standard Update related to long-duration insurance contracts, will change current accounting and disclosure requirements applicable to our consolidated financial statements. Such changes may have a material effect on our reported results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the required adoption of new accounting standards may result in significant incremental costs associated with initial implementation and ongoing compliance. See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained herein for additional information regarding accounting updates.\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 24\nCITIZENS, INC.\nUnexpected losses in future reporting periods may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we are required to evaluate our deferred tax assets (\"DTA\") quarterly for recoverability based on available evidence. This process involves management's judgment about assumptions, which are subject to change from period to period due to tax rate changes or variances between our projected operating performance and our actual results. Ultimately, future adjustments to the DTA valuation allowance, if any, will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets. The realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry back or carry forward periods under applicable tax law. Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods. Such an adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and capital position.\nAPPROXIMATELY 25% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 CONSISTED OF INVESTMENT INCOME. THE INVESTMENT RETURN, OR YIELD, ON INVESTED ASSETS IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR EARNINGS SINCE INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE PRICED WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT PREMIUMS RECEIVED CAN BE INVESTED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE BENEFITS ARE PAID. CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL OR U.S. INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT, OR MARKET DISRUPTIONS THAT AFFECT INTEREST RATES AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nSustained periods of low interest rates in the long-term investment market may adversely affect our reported net investment income and the discount rates used in reserving for our insurance products, which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe low interest rate environment continues to limit increases in profit margins for insurers, including us. We have been impacted by the historically low interest rate environment over the past several years as our fixed maturity investment portfolio, primarily invested in callable securities, has generally been reinvested at lower yields, leading to lower net investment income than assumed in the pricing and reserving for our insurance products. An interest or discount rate is used in calculating reserves for our insurance products. We set our reserve discount rate assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield for assets supporting the reserves, considering current and expected future market conditions. Spread compression and related effects to profitability caused by lower interest rates affect the valuation of in-force business more significantly than the valuation of new business, as new business pricing assumptions reflect the current and anticipated future interest rate environment. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent management\u2019s reasonable expectations regarding future developments. If the discount rate assumed in our reserve calculations is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future benefit payments. In that case, we may be required to amortize any remaining DAC, record additional liabilities and/or increase our capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries in the period this occurs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability.\nWe are exposed to significant capital market risk related to changes in interest rates. Our investment performance, including yields and realization of gains and losses, may vary depending on economic and market conditions. Substantial and sustained changes, up or down, in market interest rate levels can materially affect the profitability of our products.\nIf interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured, prepaid, been sold, or called at lower yields, reducing our investment margin. We have experienced significant call activity on our fixed maturity portfolio over the years due to the low interest rate environment. Our fixed maturity bond portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk as approximately 50% of the portfolio is callable as of December 31, 2020, with 5% that could be called within the next year. If subject to increased call activity, the Company would have to reinvest the resulting investment portfolio cash proceeds from calls as well as from maturities in lower yielding instruments, further reducing our investment income. Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance with annuity riders, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 25\nCITIZENS, INC.\n\"spread,\" or the difference between the amounts we are required to pay under our contracts to policyholders and the rate of return we are able to earn on our investments intended to support obligations under the contracts. As a key component of profitability, a narrowing of our \u201cspread\u201d may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Lowering our interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some of our products. However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields.\nAn increase in interest rates will decrease the net unrealized gain position of our investment portfolio and may subject us to disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk is the risk that in a change from a low interest rate period to a significantly higher and increasing interest rate period, policyholders may surrender their policies or make early withdrawals to increase their returns, requiring us to liquidate investments in an unrealized loss position (i.e. the market value less the carrying value of the investments).\nOur investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized investment losses. In particular, decreases in the fair value of fixed maturities may significantly reduce the value of our investments, and as a result, our financial condition may suffer.\nWe are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations under these securities could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the recognition of investment losses. The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the bonds included in our portfolio and by other factors that may result in the recognition of credit related allowances. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.\nIn particular, at December 31, 2020, fixed maturities represented $1.5 billion or 91.7% of our total investments of $1.6 billion. The fair value of fixed maturities and the related investment income fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us will generally increase or decrease in line with changes in market interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows resulting from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates. The impact of value fluctuations affects our consolidated financial statements, as all of our fixed maturities are classified as available-for-sale, with changes in fair value reflected in our stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss). No similar adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates. Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income and/or cash flows. Although at December 31, 2020, 98.5% of our fixed maturities were investment grade with 62.7% rated A or above, all of our fixed maturities are subject to credit risk. If any of the issuers of our fixed maturities suffer financial setbacks, the ratings on the fixed maturities could be downgraded (with a concurrent decrease in fair value) and, in a worst-case scenario, the issuer could default on its financial obligations. If the issuer defaults, we could have realized losses associated with the impairment of the securities.\nThe determination of valuation and impairments of our investments include estimations and assumptions that are subjective and prone to differing interpretations and could materially impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company makes assumptions regarding the fair value and expected performance of its fixed maturity securities and other investments. Valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation, particularly during periods of market disruption, resulting in values which may be less than the value at which the investments may ultimately be sold. Further, rapidly changing and/or unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of investments as reported in our consolidated financial statements, and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe decision of whether to record a credit impairment is determined by our assessment of the financial condition and prospects of a particular issuer, projections of future cash flows and recoverability as well as our ability and intent to hold the securities to recovery or maturity. We evaluate our investment portfolio for impairments. There can\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 26\nCITIZENS, INC.\nbe no assurance that we have accurately assessed the level of impairments taken. Additional impairments may need to be taken in the future, and historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments. Any event reducing the value of our securities other than on a temporary basis may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nFROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR BUSINESS BY PURCHASING OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES OR BLOCKS OF BUSINESS. SUCH ACQUISITIONS SUBJECT US TO POTENTIAL RISKS THAT COULD MATERIALLY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nWe may be required to recognize an impairment on the value of our goodwill, which would increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the amount paid by us to acquire various life insurance companies over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition. Under U.S. GAAP, we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually at the \"reporting unit\" level, which is either an operating segment or a business that is one level below the operating segment. Goodwill is impaired if its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. This may occur for various reasons, including changes in actual or expected earnings or cash flows of a reporting unit, changes in interest rates, generation of earnings by a reporting unit at a lower rate than similar businesses, declines in market prices for publicly traded businesses similar to our reporting units or increases in the carrying value of the segment caused by recognition of uncertain tax benefits. If any portion of our goodwill becomes impaired, we would be required to recognize the amount of the impairment as a current-period expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Goodwill in our consolidated financial statements related to our Life Insurance segment was $12.6 million as of December 31, 2020.\nManagement\u2019s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including qualitative and quantitative factors such as discounted cash flow calculations based on assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. Other assumptions can include levels of economic capital, future business growth, and earnings projections and trends.\nWe may be required to accelerate the costs of insurance acquired, which would increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen we acquire a block of insurance policies, we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from existing insurance and investment contracts and policies. This intangible asset, called the cost of insurance acquired, or COIA, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies. At December 31, 2020, we had $11.5 million of COIA.\nWe amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC; it is subject to acceleration and generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, persistency and maintenance expense margins. If actual experience was not as expected when the policies were acquired, we might be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy. We regularly review the quality of our COIA to determine if it is recoverable from future income. If these costs are not recoverable, the amount that is not recoverable is charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination.\nUnfavorable experience with regards to expected expenses, investment returns, surrender and other policy charges, mortality, morbidity, lapses or persistency may cause us to increase the amortization of COIA, or to record a current period expense to increase benefit reserves, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTHE COMPANY RELIES ON OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND THE DATA MAINTAINED WITHIN THOSE SYSTEMS, TO MANAGE MANY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. CYBERSECURITY RISKS, THE FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEMS TO OPERATE PROPERLY AND/OR THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY, AND AVAILABILITY OF POLICYHOLDER AND CLAIMS DATA, INCLUDING PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION, COULD RESULT IN A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 27\nCITIZENS, INC.\nOur failure to maintain effective information systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe must maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop and integrate new information systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences in a cost-effective manner. If we do not maintain adequate systems, we could experience adverse consequences, including inadequate information on which to base pricing, underwriting and reserve decisions, regulatory problems, failure to meet prompt payment obligations, increases in administrative expenses and loss of customers. Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to consolidate our existing systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of our information technology systems and software are mainframe-based, legacy-type systems that require an ongoing commitment of resources to maintain current standards. Our systems utilize proprietary code requiring highly skilled personnel. Due to the unique nature of our proprietary operating environment, we could have difficulty finding personnel with the skills required to provide ongoing system maintenance and development as we seek to keep pace with changes in our products and business models, information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and policyholder needs.\nWe are continuously evaluating and enhancing systems and creating new systems and processes as our business depends on our ability to maintain and improve our technology. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems and processes, these changes, as well as changes designed to update and enhance our protective measures to address new threats, increase the risk of a system or process failure or the creation of a gap in our security measures. Any such failure or gap could adversely affect our business operations and results of operations.\nA cyber attack or other security breach could disrupt our operations, result in the unauthorized disclosure or loss of confidential data, damage our reputation or relationships, and expose us to significant financial and legal liability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe store confidential information about our business and our policyholders, independent marketing firms, and independent agents, consultants and others on our information technology systems, including proprietary and personally identifiable information. As part of our normal business operations, we use this information and engage third-party providers, including outsourcing, cloud computing, and other business partners, that store, access, process, and transmit such information on our behalf. We devote significant resources and employ security measures to help protect our information technology systems and confidential information, and we have programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to information security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we and our third-party providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties or through open source solutions may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise our information security. Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, or other cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering.\nWe and our third-party providers experience information security incidents from time to time. There is no assurance that our security systems and measures will be able to prevent, mitigate, or remediate future incidents. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our information technology systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations, unauthorized disclosure or loss of confidential information, harm to our brand or reputation, loss of customers and revenues, violations of privacy and other laws, and exposure to litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement proceedings, fines, and potentially criminal proceedings and penalties. If we are unaware of the incident for some time after it occurs, our exposure could increase. In addition, the costs to address or remediate systems disruptions or security threats or vulnerabilities, whether before or after an incident, could be significant. As we continue to build our digital capabilities and focus on enhancing the customer experience, the amount of information that we retain and share with third parties is likely to grow, increasing the cost to prevent data security breaches and the cost and potential consequences of such breaches. An information technology systems\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 28\nCITIZENS, INC.\nfailure could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators.\nAlthough we have insurance against some cyber risks and attacks, we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits, are subject to deductibles or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies.\nThe failure of our business recovery and incident management processes to resume our business operations in the event of a catastrophe, cyber attack, or other event could adversely affect our profitability, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIn the event of a disaster such as a catastrophe, an epidemic, a cyber attack, cyber security breach or other information technology systems failure, a terrorist attack, or war, unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those problems affect our information technology systems and destroy valuable data or result in a significant failure of our internal control environment. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our employees were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised.\nThe failure of our information technology and/or disaster recovery systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers\u2019 operations and result in the loss, theft, or failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to our customers. Such a failure could harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions, legal claims, and increased expenses, and lead to a loss of customers and revenues.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR HOLDING SECURITIES\nIf our foreign policyholders reduced or ceased participation in our CISIP or if a foreign securities regulatory authority were to deem the CISIP's operation contrary to such country's securities laws, the volume of Class A common stock purchased on the open market through the CISIP, and the price of our Class A common stock, could fall.\nA significant portion of our Class A common stock has been purchased under the CISIP by foreign holders of life insurance policies (or related brokers). The CISIP is registered with the SEC pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, but is not registered under the laws of any foreign jurisdiction. If a foreign securities regulatory authority were to determine the offer and sale of our Class A common stock under the CISIP was not allowed under applicable laws and regulations of its jurisdiction, such authority may issue or assert a fine, penalty or cease and desist order against our offer and sale of Class A common stock in that foreign jurisdiction. There is a risk our Class A common stock price could be negatively impacted by a decrease in participation in the CISIP. If fewer policyholders are eligible to or elect to participate in the CISIP, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may decline from its present levels, the demand for our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted and the price of our Class A common stock could fall.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as applicable insurance laws in the jurisdictions where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as insurance laws in the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a takeover attempt or a change in control that our shareholders might consider in their best interests. As a result, our shareholders may be prevented from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our Class A common stock that may be offered by a bidder in a takeover context or the Company may not be able to reissue the Class B common stock in order to provide capital to the Company.\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 29\nCITIZENS, INC.\nThe following provisions in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws make it difficult for our Class A shareholders to replace or remove our directors and have other anti-takeover effects that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt:\n\u2022holders of shares of our Class B common stock elect a simple majority of our Board, and\n\u2022our Board may issue one or more series of preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders.\nInsurance laws generally require prior approval of a change in control of an insurance company. Generally, such laws provide that control over an insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting securities of the insurer. In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, an insurance commissioner generally will consider such factors as the experience, competence and financial strength of the proposed acquirer, the integrity of the proposed acquirer's board of directors and executive officers, the proposed acquirer's plans for the management and operation of the insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the acquisition. These insurance requirements may delay, deter or prevent our ability to complete an acquisition or sell the Class B common stock in order to raise capital.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nLitigation and regulatory actions and investigations are common in our businesses and may result in financial losses and/or harm to our reputation.\nFrom time to time we are, and have been, subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions and investigations relating to our business operations. We are, and in the future may be, parties in various litigation matters. An adverse outcome in one or more of these actions, investigations or litigation matters may, depending on the nature, scope and amount of the ruling, materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition, encourage other litigation, and limit our ability to write new business, particularly if the adverse outcomes negatively impact our reputation.\nIn the absence of countervailing considerations, we would expect to defend any such actions, investigations or litigation matters vigorously. However, in doing so, we could incur significant defense costs, including attorneys' fees, other direct litigation costs and the expenditure of substantial amounts of management time that otherwise would be devoted to our business. Further, if we suffer an adverse judgment as a result of any claim, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nReinsurance may not be available or affordable, or reinsurers may be unwilling or unable to meet their obligations under our reinsurance contracts, which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nAs part of our overall risk management and capital management strategies, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various insurance subsidiaries. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of reinsurance. Any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and may impact the level of capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries, and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will, absent a decrease in the amount of reinsurance, reduce our results of operations. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which may adversely affect our ability to write future business, result in the assumption of more risk with respect to the policies we issue, and increase our capital requirements. The collectability of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers. We cannot provide assurance that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverable owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis. The insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nDecember 31, 2020 | 10-K 30\nCITIZENS, INC.\nEvents that damage our reputation may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThere are many events which may harm our reputation, including, but not limited to, those discussed in this Item 1A regarding regulatory investigations, legal proceedings, cyber or other information security incidents and disputes with our independent agents and consultants.\nIn addition, as an insurance company, we are paid to accept certain risks. Those who conduct our business, including executive officers and members of management, and to some extent, independent agents and consultants, do so in part by making decisions that involve exposing us to risk. These include decisions such as maintaining effective underwriting and pricing discipline, maintaining effective claim management and customer service performance, managing our investment portfolio, delivering effective technology solutions, complying with established sales practices, executing our capital management strategy, exiting a line of business and/or pursuing strategic growth initiatives, and other decisions. Although we have a risk management framework and employ controls and procedures designed to monitor business decisions and prevent us from taking excessive risks or unintentionally failing to comply with internal policies and practices such that errors occur, there can be no assurance that these controls and procedures will be effective. If our employees and independent agents and consultants take excessive risks and/or fail to comply with internal policies and practices, the impact of those events may damage our market position and reputation.\nDepending on the severity of the damage to our reputation, we may be unable to effectively compete for new products or retain our existing business, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Damage to our reputation may also hinder our ability to raise new capital and/or increase our cost of capital.", "PERMNO": 23799, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "CIA"}
