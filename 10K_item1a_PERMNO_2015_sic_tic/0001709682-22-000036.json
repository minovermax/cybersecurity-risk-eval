{"cik": "1709682", "company": "Custom Truck One Source, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the risk factors discussed herein should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations.\nEffective management of our rental equipment is vital to our business and inability to obtain raw materials, component parts and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.\nOur rental equipment has a long economic life, and managing this equipment is a critical element to our business. We must successfully maintain and repair our equipment in a cost-effective manner to maximize the economic life of our products and the level of proceeds from the sale of such products. As the needs of our customers change, we may need to incur costs to relocate or remanufacture our assets to better meet shifts in demand. If the distribution of our assets is not aligned with regional demand, we may be unable to take advantage of opportunities despite excess inventory in other regions. If we are not able to successfully manage our assets, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe purchase raw materials, component parts and finished goods to be used in the manufacturing and sale of our products. In addition, we may incorporate vehicle chassis provided directly by our customers in our production process. Although the vast majority of our raw materials and component parts are sourced domestically, certain of our suppliers are based overseas, and certain of our domestic suppliers may source subcomponents from overseas. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have been known to occur in certain of these international regions, resulting in public health crises. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages in availability of materials, production delays, regulatory restrictions, public health crises, or other supply chain disruptions, whether due to our suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture and market products. Increases in the costs of shipping and transportation, purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers.\nA small portion of our workforce is unionized, and more of our workforce could become unionized in the future, which could negatively impact the stability of our production, materially reduce our profitability and increase the risk of work stoppages.\nOur employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union, and unions may conduct organizing activities in this regard. If our employees choose to form or affiliate with a union and the terms of a union collective bargaining agreement are significantly different from our current compensation and job assignment arrangements with our employees, these arrangements could negatively impact the stability of our production, materially reduce our profitability and increase the risk of work stoppages. In addition, even if our managed operations remain primarily non-union, our business may still be adversely affected by work stoppages at any of our suppliers that are unionized. The stoppage of work for a prolonged period of time at one, or several, of our principal manufacturing facilities resulting from union or non-union matters, could materially adversely affect our business.\nAs a small portion of our workforce is unionized, we are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 3% of the U.S. hourly workers of the Company were represented by a labor union and were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Any strikes, threats of strikes or other organized disruptions in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or other negotiations could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce costs and improve production efficiencies.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled technicians, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand.\nCompetition for skilled technicians in our industry, especially during periods of low unemployment or periods of high demand, could increase our labor costs and hinder our ability to meet customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA number of key personnel are critical to the success of our business.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. Competition within our industry and the business world for high-performing management talent is substantial. We have senior executives and other management level employees with extensive industry experience. We rely on this knowledge and experience in our strategic planning and in our day-to-day business operations. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to retain our senior management, the loss of one or more of whom could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, due to our legacy as a combination of several family operated businesses, a number of our key employees have family relationships within our organization and our inability to retain those individuals could have a negative impact on our business. Competition for experienced managers and skilled technicians in our industry can be intense. If we fail to retain and recruit the necessary personnel, our business and our ability to retain customers and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer.\nA material disruption to our operation and manufacturing locations could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nWe have several significant production and manufacturing locations. If operations at any of these production and manufacturing locations were disrupted as a result of public health concerns, equipment failures, natural disasters, work stoppages, power outages or other reasons, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Interruptions in production could increase costs and delay delivery of units in production. Production capacity limits could cause us to reduce or delay sales efforts until production capacity is available.\nWe may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations and contribute to negative market perceptions about the Company or its securities, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nThe cost of new equipment that we purchase for use in our rental fleet or for our sales inventory may increase, and the aging or obsolescence of our existing equipment, and the fluctuation of the market value thereof, could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations.\nThe cost of new equipment from manufacturers that we purchase for use in our rental fleet may increase as a result of factors beyond our control, such as inflation, higher interest rates and increased raw material costs, including increases in the cost of steel, which is a primary material used in most of the equipment we use. Such increases could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations in future periods if we are not able to pass such cost increases through to our customers in the form of higher prices. In addition, based on changing demands of our customers, the types of equipment we rent to our customers may become obsolete resulting in a negative impact on our financial condition based on the increased capital expenditures required to replace the obsolete equipment, and our potential inability to sell the obsolete equipment in the used equipment market. In addition, we may incur losses upon dispositions of our rental fleet due to residual value risk.\nIf the average age of our fleet of rental equipment were to increase, the cost of maintaining our equipment, if not replaced within a certain period of time, will likely increase. If our operating costs increase as our rental equipment fleet ages and we are unable to pass along such costs, our earnings will decrease. As of December 31, 2021, the average age of our rental equipment fleet was less than five years. The costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future. Any significant increase in such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its book value at the time of sale. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022the market price for new equipment of a like kind;\n\u2022wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age;\n\u2022the time of year that it is sold (prices are generally higher during the construction seasons);\n\u2022worldwide and domestic demand for used equipment;\n\u2022the supply of used equipment on the market; and\n\u2022general economic conditions.\nWe include in operating income the difference between the sales price and the book value of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gains or losses realized upon disposal of equipment. We cannot assure you that used equipment selling prices will not decline. Any significant decline in the selling prices for used equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent on the timely and sufficient delivery of finished goods, such as commercial vehicles, from our suppliers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact the supply chains of the commercial vehicle manufacturers and dealers on which we depend. The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to make it difficult to predict our future business\nand financial performance. The ensuing economic impacts from restrictions put in place around the globe to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including shutdowns and workplace changes, have led to issues, broadly, in the global flow of goods and services (the \u201csupply chain\u201d). The Company continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions on our supply chain, including, but not limited to, the commercial vehicle manufacturers that provide the chassis used in our production and manufacturing processes. Supply chain disruptions, such as the ongoing semiconductor shortage, could potentially limit the ability of these manufacturers to meet demand in future periods. Disruptions in the supply chains of these manufacturers and dealers, such as pandemic-related plant and production shutdowns, semiconductor chip shortages, labor and equipment shortages, and transportation delays could significantly impact our ability to meet customer demand and generate revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIntegration of the Nesco and the Custom Truck LP businesses may be difficult, costly and time-consuming, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Acquisition may not be realized or may be less than expected.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the two businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate Nesco and Custom Truck LP or, if the integration is successfully accomplished, that the integration will not be more costly or take longer than presently contemplated. If we cannot successfully integrate and manage the two businesses within a reasonable time following the Acquisition, we may not be able to realize the potential and anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur ability to realize the expected synergies and benefits of the Acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results, and include, among other things:\n\u2022our ability to complete the timely integration of operations and systems, organizations, standards, controls, procedures, policies and technologies, as well as the harmonization of differences in the business cultures of Nesco and Custom Truck LP;\n\u2022our ability to minimize the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns during the integration process;\n\u2022our ability to retain the service of key management and other key personnel;\n\u2022our ability to preserve customer, supplier and other important relationships and resolve potential conflicts that may arise;\n\u2022the risk that certain customers and suppliers will opt to discontinue business with the combined company or exercise their right to terminate their agreements as a result of the Acquisition pursuant to change of control provisions in their agreements or otherwise;\n\u2022the risk that Custom Truck LP may have liabilities that we failed to discover or fully appreciate in the course of performing due diligence;\n\u2022difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination; and\n\u2022difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex combined company.\nWe may encounter additional integration-related costs, fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the Acquisition or be subject to other factors that adversely affect preliminary estimates. In addition, even if the operations of the two businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the Acquisition may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. The occurrence of any of these events, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe expect to achieve pro forma cost synergies totaling approximately $50 million within two years of the Closing Date. We also expect to incur integration and restructuring costs of approximately $50 million to achieve these synergies, with $40 million of these costs incurred in the first two years following the Closing Date. The anticipated synergies are based upon assumptions about our ability to implement integration measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. Our ability to achieve the planned synergies is dependent upon a significant number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as our ability to integrate businesses that we acquire (including the integration of Nesco and Custom Truck LP), operating difficulties, increased operating costs, delays in implementing initiatives and general economic, competitive or industry conditions. For example, we may be unable to eliminate duplicative costs in a timely fashion or at all. Additionally, achieving these benefits may require certain related one-time costs, charges and expenses, which may be material. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in generating growth,\nmaintaining or increasing our cash flows or profitability or achieving cost savings and revenue enhancements, and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nThe assumptions and estimates underlying the pro forma cost synergies are inherently uncertain and, although considered reasonable by our management as of the date of this report, are subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the financial projections, including, among others, risks and uncertainties due to general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions, as well as changes in the combined company\u2019s businesses, financial condition or results of operations, and other risks and uncertainties included in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nPlatinum owns the majority of our equity, and its interests may not be aligned with yours.\nPlatinum owns the majority of our fully diluted shares and, therefore, has the power to control our affairs and policies. Platinum also controls, to a large degree, the election of directors, the appointment of management, the entry into mergers, sales of substantially all of our assets, and other extraordinary transactions. The directors so elected have authority, subject to the terms of our indebtedness, to issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase programs, declare dividends and make other decisions. The interests of Platinum could conflict with your interests. For example, Platinum is in the business of making investments in companies and, from time to time in the future, may acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. Platinum may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, these acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nWe have, and may incur, significant indebtedness and may be unable to service our debt. This indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position, limit our available cash and our access to additional capital and prevent us from growing our business.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including in connection with our growth capital expenditure plan. As of December 31, 2021, our total indebtedness was $1,356.7 million, consisting of $920.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Secured Notes, $394.9 million of borrowings under our Asset Based Lending (\u201cABL\u201d) Facility and capital lease and other debt obligations of $41.8 million (excluding approximately $238.0 million of indebtedness under our floorplan financing agreements). Although the Indenture and the ABL Credit Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on our incurrence of certain liabilities or obligations that are not considered \u201cIndebtedness\u201d under the Indenture (such as operating leases), nor does it impose any limitation on the amount of liabilities incurred by our subsidiaries, if any, that might be designated as \u201cunrestricted subsidiaries\u201d under such Indenture. Similarly, the ABL Credit Agreement does not impose any limitation on our incurrence of certain liabilities or obligations that are not considered \u201cIndebtedness\u201d under the agreement (such as operating leases).\nThe level of our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022a portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to debt service and may not be available for other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and potentially impeding our ability to secure favorable lease terms;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowings under our ABL Facility are subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u2022making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and industry conditions and possibly limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt; and\n\u2022increasing our cost of borrowing.\nIf new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks that we now face would intensify.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. An inability to service our indebtedness could lead to a default under the Indenture or ABL Credit Agreement, which may result in an acceleration of our indebtedness.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to pay interest and principal in the future on our indebtedness and to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance and the availability of refinancing options, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, the availability of capital, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur future cash flow may not be sufficient to meet our obligations and commitments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our indebtedness and to meet our other commitments, we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. These actions may not be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, and these actions may not enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements. In addition, our existing debt agreements, including the Indenture and the ABL Credit Agreement, contain, or future debt agreements may contain, restrictive covenants prohibiting us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.\nThe Indenture and the ABL Credit Agreement impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our company and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nThe Indenture and the ABL Credit Agreement impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions will limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends or certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022make certain investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022place restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;\n\u2022engage in transactions with stockholders or affiliates;\n\u2022sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies, reorganize our companies, or suspend or dispose of a substantial portion of our business;\n\u2022prepay or modify the terms of our other indebtedness;\n\u2022guarantee indebtedness; and\n\u2022create liens.\nThere are limitations on our ability to incur the full $750.0 million of commitments under the ABL Facility. Availability will be limited to the lesser of a borrowing base and $750.0 million. The borrowing base is calculated on a monthly (or more frequent under certain circumstances) valuation of our parts inventory, fleet inventory accounts receivable and unrestricted cash (in each case, subject to customary reserves). As a result, our access to credit under the ABL Facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations, depending on the value of the borrowing base-eligible assets as of any measurement date. With respect to the ABL Facility, on any date when Availability (as such term shall be defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) is less than the greater of (i) 10% of the lesser of (A) the aggregate revolving commitments under the ABL Facility at such time and (B) the borrowing base at such time (such lesser amount, the \u201cLine Cap\u201d) and (ii) $60 million, we will also be required by a springing covenant to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00, tested for the four fiscal quarter period ending on the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which financials have been delivered, and at the end of each succeeding fiscal quarter thereafter until the date on which Availability has been equal to or greater than the greater of (x) 10% of the Line Cap, and (y) $56 million for five consecutive business days. Our ability to meet the financial covenant could be affected by events beyond our control. The inability to borrow under the ABL Facility may adversely affect our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make strategic acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. A failure to comply with the restrictions in the Indenture and the ABL Credit Agreement could result in an event of default under such instruments or credit agreement. Our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with the covenants in the Indenture or ABL Credit Agreement or to remedy any such default. In addition, in the event of\nan acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness or make any accelerated payments, including those under the Indenture and under our ABL Facility. If we default on our indebtedness, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our ABL Facility are at variable rates of interest and will expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2021, we have variable rate debt, consisting of $394.9 million outstanding under the ABL Facility. Holding other variables constant, each one-eighth percentage point increase or decrease in the applicable interest rates would correspondingly change our interest expense on the ABL Facility by approximately $0.5 million per year. This amount does not reflect the impact of the interest rate collar currently in place. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to any of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nThe phase-out of LIBOR, and uncertainty as to its replacement, may adversely affect our business.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR after 2021 after which time it can no longer guarantee its availability. In March 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the administrator of LIBOR, extended the transition dates of certain LIBOR tenors to June 30, 2023, after which LIBOR reference rates will cease to be provided. Despite this deferral, the LIBOR administrator has advised that no new contracts using U.S. Dollar LIBOR should be entered into after December 31, 2021. It is unknown whether any banks will continue to voluntarily submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR, or whether LIBOR will continue to be published by its administrator based on these submissions, or on any other basis, after such dates. Although alternative reference rates have been proposed, it is unknown at this point which of these alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements for LIBOR.\nCertain of our agreements, including derivative agreements, also make reference to LIBOR. To prepare for the phase out of LIBOR, we may need to renegotiate these agreements and may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us. It is also currently unknown what impact any contract modification will have on our financial statements. Further, the financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase out of LIBOR if banks fail to execute a smooth transition to an alternate rate.\nDisruption in the financial markets or the inability to renegotiate our agreements to remove and replace LIBOR on favorable terms, or a negative impact from any contract modifications, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.\nDisruptions or security compromises affecting our information technology systems or those of our critical service providers could adversely affect our operating results by subjecting us to liability, and limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations, adjust to changing market conditions, or implement strategic initiatives.\nThe security and integrity of our information technology systems and assets are critical to our business and ability to monitor and control our operations, deliver our products and services, and adjust to changing market conditions. While we own certain of our information technology systems, we also engage third parties across an array of software, systems and technologies (including cloud-based) and functions (e.g., HR, finance, communications, compliance), which enable us to conduct, monitor and/or protect our business, operations, systems and data assets. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we and/or our service providers collect, process and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business data and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information.\nWe and our service providers experience constant threats to our data and systems, and despite various security controls and measures, we remain vulnerable to cyberattacks and security incidents resulting from malware (e.g., ransomware), computer viruses, malfeasance by external or internal actors, and/or incidents attributable to human error (e.g., due to social engineering or phishing). The White House, SEC and other regulators have accordingly increased their focus on companies\u2019 cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. We have also observed a global increase in cybersecurity threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks and threat actors. Such attacks and threats are unpredictable as to their timing, nature and scope. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent future attacks, particularly as the methodologies utilized by attackers change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and we may be unable to investigate or remediate incidents due to the increased use by threat actors of tools and techniques that are designed to\ncircumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented additional operational and cybersecurity risks due to work-from-home arrangements at the Company and our providers.\nAny successful cyberattack, compromise, breach, or disruption involving our or our critical service providers\u2019 information technology systems, or the failure of any of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. Further, any compromise or breach of such systems could result in adverse publicity, harm our reputation, lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our customers and employees, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain of our software applications are also utilized by third parties who provide outsourced administrative functions, which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. In addition, because our systems may contain sensitive data information about individuals and businesses, our failure to maintain the security, integrity or confidentiality of the data we hold, whether the result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues, increased costs for compliance and systems remediation, increased costs of liability for litigation and regulatory proceedings as well as fines and penalties, result in the misuse of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, misappropriation of assets or production stoppages and supply shortages, and other potential material adverse effects on our results of operations. Our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold could also violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws and subject us to lawsuits, fines and other means of regulatory enforcement. Global data privacy and cybersecurity rules, regulations and industry standards are rapidly evolving, including laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act, which provides for a private right of action for certain types of data breaches. Complying with any new or changing legal and regulatory requirements could force us to incur substantial expenses or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could harm our business. If any security attacks, breaches or incidents are not detected or deflected by our current security measures, we could also be required to expend additional capital and other resources, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks and liabilities, there can be no guarantee that any or all costs or losses incurred will be partially or fully insured.", "PERMNO": 17032, "SIC": 5063, "TIC": "NSCO"}
