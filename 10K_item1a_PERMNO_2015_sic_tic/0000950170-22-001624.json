RISK FACTORS\nThe Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within the Company's control, which may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. Investors should consider carefully information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in light of the risk factors described below.\nRisks Relating to Our Business, Operations and Industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and supply chain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in national, state and local government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus, shelter-in-place restrictions, and limitations or shutdowns of business operations. These measures, some of which are continuing or being re-implemented in light of new variants of the virus, have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our dealers and suppliers. We have significant operations worldwide, including in the United States, France, Germany, Portugal, Italy and China and each of these countries have been affected by the pandemic and have taken measures to try to contain it, resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing facilities and support operations. There is still uncertainty regarding the full impact and duration of such measures and potential future measures, and restrictions on our access to our facilities or on our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our customers, dealers and suppliers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our supply chain and resulted in associated cost and labor pressures as well as delays in scheduled shipments of our products. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and supply chain, although the full extent is still uncertain. As the pandemic continues to evolve and new variants continue to emerge, the extent of the impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and supply chain will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the continued duration of the pandemic, government actions to contain the virus and/or treat its impact, restrictions on travel, the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer demand, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, all of which are still uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nBecause we participate in end markets that are highly competitive, our net sales and profits could decline as we respond, or fail to effectively respond, to competition.\nWe sell most of our products in highly competitive end markets. We compete in each of those end markets based on product design, quality of products, quality and responsiveness of product support services, product performance, maintenance costs and price. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may, among others:\n\u2022\trespond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;\n\u2022\thave greater name recognition, critical mass or geographic market presence;\n\u2022\tbe better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\tadapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements;\n\u2022\tdevote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products;\n\u2022\tbe better positioned to compete on price for their products, due to any combination of low-cost labor, raw materials, components, facilities or other operating items, or willingness to sell at lower margins than us;\n\u2022\tconsolidate with other competitors in the industry which may create increased pricing and competitive pressures on our business; and\n\u2022\tbe better able to utilize excess capacity which may reduce the cost of their products or services.\nWe cannot be certain that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, any of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSales of our products are cyclical and/or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or variable factors. A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity, including as a result of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, or fluctuations in those other factors can have a material adverse effect on us.\nHistorically, sales of products that we manufacture and sell have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors. In particular, demand for our products is cyclical and is impacted by the strength of the economy, generally, the availability of financing and other factors, including crude oil prices, that may have an effect on the level of construction activity on an international, national or regional basis, each of which have been and/or continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. During periods of expansion in construction activity, we generally have benefited from increased demand for our products. Conversely, during recessionary periods, we have been adversely affected by reduced demand for our products, and challenging conditions can continue well beyond the end of such periods. Furthermore, any future economic recession may impact leveraged companies, such as Manitowoc, more than competing companies with less leverage and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for our products also depend in part on federal, state, local and foreign governmental spending and appropriations, including infrastructure, security and defense outlays. Reductions in governmental spending can reduce demand for our products, which in turn, can negatively affect our performance. Our sales depend in part upon our customers\u2019 replacement or repair cycles. Adverse economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have caused and may continue to cause customers to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery.\nIf we are unable to sufficiently adjust to market conditions, among other potential adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, we could fail to deliver on planned results, fall short of analyst and investor expectations, incur high fixed costs and/or fail to benefit from higher than expected customer demand resulting in loss of market share.\nLarge or rapid increases in the cost of raw materials or components parts, substantial decreases in their availability, or our dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials and component parts could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe use large amounts of steel, among other items, in the manufacture of our products. Occasionally, market prices of some of our key raw materials increase significantly, including as a result of tariffs or other trade barriers. If in the future we are not\nable to reduce product costs in other areas or pass raw material price increases on to our customers, our margins could be adversely affected. In addition, because we maintain limited raw material and component inventories, even brief unanticipated delays in delivery by suppliers - including those due to capacity constraints, labor disputes, impaired financial condition of suppliers, epidemics, pandemics like COVID-19, other infectious diseases, weather emergencies or other natural disasters - may impair our ability to satisfy our customers and could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe Company purchases one branded crane and parts under strategic alliances from third-party suppliers which are then sold into our markets. If we are not able to effectively manage pricing from these suppliers, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our suppliers terminate these agreements and we are unable to procure alternate products at substantially similar competitive pricing, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nUnfair foreign competition could adversely affect our financial results.\nMany of our foreign competitors benefit from government policies that could give them a competitive advantage in the United States, including currency devaluation and erecting trade barriers that prevent American manufacturers from selling cranes in those markets. Low-cost competition from China and other developing markets could also result in decreased demand for our products. If competition in our industry intensifies or if our current competitors lower their prices for competing products, we may lose sales or be required to lower the prices we charge for our products, which may undermine our ability to generate returns on our investments.\nIf we fail to identify, manage, complete and appropriately integrate acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures or other significant transactions, it may adversely affect our future results.\nWe completed two acquisitions in 2021 and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures or other significant transactions. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify attractive acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint venture opportunities, potentially obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, successfully complete the transaction, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as integration of the acquired company or employees. We may not be able to identify or complete appealing acquisition, strategic alliance or joint venture opportunities given the intense competition for these transactions. Even if we identify and complete suitable transactions, we may not be able to successfully address inherent risks in a timely manner, or at all. These inherent risks include, among other things: failure to achieve all or any projected synergies, performance targets or other anticipated benefits of the acquisition, strategic alliance, joint venture; failure to successfully integrate the purchased operations, technologies, products or services and maintain uniform standard controls, policies and procedures; incur substantial unanticipated integration costs; lose key employees, including those of an acquired business; diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; failure to retain the customers of the acquired business; additional debt and/or assumption of known or unknown liabilities; potential dilutive issuances of equity securities; and a write-off of goodwill, customer lists, other intangibles and amortization of expenses. If we fail to successfully integrate an acquisition, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, and our future results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our key executive officers, managers and skilled personnel and may have difficulty retaining and recruiting qualified employees.\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers, senior management personnel, managers and other skilled personnel and our ability to recruit and retain skilled personnel to maintain and expand our operations. We could be affected by the loss of any of our executive officers who are responsible for formulating and implementing our business plan and strategy. In addition, we need to recruit and retain additional management personnel and other skilled employees. However, competition is high for skilled technical personnel among companies that rely on engineering and technology, especially in light of the labor pressures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct design, engineering and manufacturing activities successfully and develop marketable products. We may not be able to attract the skilled personnel we require or retain those whom we have trained at our own cost. If we are not able to do so, our business and our ability to continue to grow could be negatively affected and we could face additional competition from those employees who leave and work for our competitors.\nWe may not be able to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to:\n\u2022\thire, retain and expand our pool of qualified engineering and technical personnel;\n\u2022\tmaintain technological leadership in our industry;\n\u2022\tsuccessfully anticipate or respond to changes in manufacturing processes in a cost-effective and timely manner; and\n\u2022\tsuccessfully anticipate or respond to changes in cost to serve in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or uncompetitive. We may have to acquire new technologies and equipment to remain competitive. The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require us to incur significant expense and capital investment, which could reduce our margins and affect our operating results. When we establish new facilities, we may not be able to maintain or develop our engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise due to a lack of trained personnel, effective training of new staff or technical difficulties with machinery. Failure to anticipate and adapt to customers\u2019 changing technological needs and requirements or to hire and retain a sufficient number of engineers and maintain engineering, technological and manufacturing expertise may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn inability to successfully manage information systems, or to adequately maintain these systems and their security, as well as to protect data and other confidential information, could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data and information, including our proprietary and regulated business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our employees. We depend on our information systems to successfully manage our business. We have taken steps to maintain adequate data security by implementing cyber security technologies, internal controls, and network and data center resiliency and recovery processes. However, any inability to successfully manage these systems, including matters related to system and data security, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nDespite our efforts, our information systems, like those of other companies, are susceptible to damage or interruption due to natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, viruses, breaches of security, system upgrades or new system implementations. Furthermore, like the cybersecurity incident that occurred in June 2021, our security measures may not detect or prevent all security threats, whether from intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data, such as denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions. Any operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of both our and our customers\u2019 financial, product and other confidential information, result in regulatory actions and legal proceedings, and/or have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nAny disruption in our information systems could disrupt our operations and would be adverse to our business and financial operations.\nWe depend on various information systems to support our customers\u2019 requirements and to successfully manage our business, including managing orders, suppliers, accounting controls and payroll. Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation or execution of our information systems and back-up systems, including matters related to system security, reliability, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. Such disruptions may not be covered by our business interruption insurance.\nWe have incurred and may incur in the future additional expenses and delays due to interruptions at our manufacturing facilities as a result of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, and in the future we may also incur additional expenses and delays due to technical problems or other interruptions at our manufacturing facilities.\nDisruptions in operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, technical problems or other interruptions, such as floods, fire, natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics or other public health crises, have and in the future may adversely affect the\nmanufacturing capacity of our facilities. Such interruptions have caused, and in the future could cause, delays in production and cause us to incur additional expenses such as charges for expedited deliveries for products that are delayed. Additionally, our customers may have the ability to cancel purchase orders in the event of any delays in production and may decrease future orders if delays are persistent. Additionally, to the extent that such disruptions do not result from damage to our physical property, these may not be covered by our business interruption insurance. Any such disruptions may adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.\nIf we do not develop new and innovative products or if customers in our markets do not accept them, our results could be negatively affected.\nOur products must be kept current to meet our customers\u2019 needs. To remain competitive, we therefore must develop new and innovative products on an on-going basis. If we fail to make innovations or the market does not accept our new products, our sales and results would likely suffer. We invest significantly in the research and development of new products. These expenditures do not always result in products that will be accepted by the market. To the extent they do not, whether as a function of the product or the business cycle, we will have increased expenses without significant sales to benefit us. Failure to develop successful new products may also cause potential customers to purchase competitors\u2019 products, rather than products manufactured by us.\nWe have significant manufacturing and sales of our products outside of the United States and such international operations may be subject to a number of risks specific to these countries.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, approximately 61%, 61% and 53%, respectively, of our net sales were attributable to products sold outside of the United States. Expanding the Company\u2019s international sales is part of our growth strategy. Our international operations across many different jurisdictions may be subject to a number of risks specific to these countries, including:\n\u2022\tless flexible employee relationships which can be difficult and expensive to terminate;\n\u2022\tlabor unrest;\n\u2022\tpolitical and economic instability (including war and acts of terrorism);\n\u2022\tinadequate infrastructure for our operations (i.e., lack of adequate power, water, transportation and raw materials);\n\u2022\thealth concerns and related government actions (including as a result of pandemics like COVID-19);\n\u2022\trisk of governmental expropriation of our property;\n\u2022\tless favorable, or relatively undefined, intellectual property laws;\n\u2022\tunexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws;\n\u2022\tlonger customer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting trade accounts receivable;\n\u2022\texport duties, tariffs, import controls and trade barriers (including quotas);\n\u2022\tadverse trade policies or adverse changes to any of the policies of either the United States or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u2022\tadverse changes in tax rates or regulations;\n\u2022\tlegal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;\n\u2022\tburdens of complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties, environmental policies and privacy issues;\n\u2022\tinability to utilize net operating losses incurred by our foreign operations against future income in the same jurisdiction; and\n\u2022\teconomies that are emerging or developing, that may be subject to greater currency volatility, negative growth, high inflation, limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks.\nThese factors may harm our results of operations, and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective. In our experience, entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start-up expenses for market development, hiring and establishing\noffice facilities before any significant revenue is generated. As a result, initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties.\nWe sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, agents and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors). Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration risk, credit risk, and compliance risks. Distributors may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors (including as a result of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic) could negatively impact our sales. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.\nIncreasing costs of doing business in many countries in which we operate may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIncreasing costs such as labor and overhead costs in the countries in which we operate may erode our profit margins and compromise our price competitiveness. Historically, the low cost of labor in certain of the countries in which we operate has been a competitive advantage but labor costs globally have been increasing. Our profitability also depends on our ability to manage and contain our other operating expenses such as the cost of utilities, factory supplies, factory space costs, equipment rental, repairs and maintenance and freight and packaging expenses. In the event we are unable to manage any increase in our labor and other operating expenses in an environment where revenue does not increase proportionately, our financial results would be adversely affected.\nOur operations and profitability could suffer if we experience problems with labor relations.\nAs of December 31, 2021 we employed approximately 4,600 people worldwide, of which approximately 1,600 were employed in the United States and approximately 3,000 employed outside the United States. A large majority of our European employees belong to various European trade unions. Additionally, we have one trade union in China, one trade union in India and two trade unions in North America. Approximately 55 employees are members of trade unions in North America.\nAny significant labor relations issues could have an adverse effect on our operations, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to recover from natural or man-made disasters or public health crises like COVID-19 could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and financial results may be affected by certain events that we cannot anticipate or that are beyond our control, such as natural or manmade disasters, epidemics, pandemics like COVID-19 or other public health crises, national emergencies, significant labor strikes, work stoppages, the effects of climate change, political unrest, war or terrorist activities that could curtail production at our facilities and cause delayed deliveries and canceled orders. In addition, we purchase components and raw materials and information technology and other services from numerous suppliers, and, even if our facilities were not directly affected by such events, we have been and in the future could be affected by interruptions at such suppliers. Such suppliers may be less likely than our own facilities to be able to quickly recover from such events and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations. We cannot be assured that we will have insurance to adequately compensate us for any of these events.\nOur restructuring plans and other cost savings initiatives may not be as effective as we anticipate, and we may fail to realize the cost savings and increased efficiencies that we expect from these actions. Our operating results could be negatively affected by our inability to effectively implement such restructuring plans and other cost saving initiatives.\nWe continually seek ways to simplify or improve processes, eliminate excess capacity and reduce costs in all areas of our operations, which from time to time includes restructuring activities. We have implemented significant restructuring activities across our global manufacturing, sales and distribution footprint, which includes workforce reductions and facility consolidations.\nOur restructuring actions may not be as effective as we anticipate, and we may fail to realize the cost savings we expect from these actions. Actual charges, costs and adjustments due to restructuring activities may vary materially from our estimates. Our restructuring plans will require significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other benefits.\nAlthough we have considered the impact of local regulations, negotiations with employee representatives and the related costs associated with our restructuring activities, factors beyond the control of management may affect the timing of these projects and therefore affect when savings will be achieved under the plans. Further, our operating results could be negatively affected if we are not successful in completing the restructuring projects in the time frames contemplated or if additional issues arise during the projects that add costs to or disrupt our operations.\nFinancial Risks\nSome of our customers may not be able to obtain financing with third parties to purchase our products, and we may incur expenses associated with our assistance to customers in securing third-party financing.\nA portion of our sales are financed by third-party finance companies on behalf of our customers. The availability of financing from third parties is affected by general economic conditions (including the negative impact on economic conditions as a result of COVID-19 and the uncertain future impacts of the continuing pandemic), the creditworthiness of our customers and the estimated residual value of our equipment. In certain transactions, we provide residual value guarantees and buyback commitments to our customers or to third-party financial institutions. Deterioration in the credit quality of our customers or the overall health of the finance industry could negatively impact our customers\u2019 ability to obtain the resources needed to make purchases of our equipment or their ability to obtain third-party financing. In addition, if the actual value of the equipment for which we have provided a residual value guaranty declines below the amount of our guaranty, we may incur additional costs, which may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur goodwill and other intangible assets represent a material amount of our total assets; as a result, impairments have had, and future impairment may have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $389.3 million, or approximately 21.9% of our total assets. We assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. If future operating performance were to fall below current projections or if there are material changes to management\u2019s assumptions, we could be required to recognize additional non-cash charges to operating earnings for goodwill and/or other intangible asset impairment. Goodwill or intangible asset impairments have had, and any future impairments may have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur results of operations are subject to exchange rate and other currency risks. A significant movement in exchange rates could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of our operations are and will continue to be conducted by subsidiaries in foreign countries. The results of the operations and the financial position of these subsidiaries will be reported in the relevant foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements, which are stated in U.S. dollars. The exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Such fluctuations may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.\nWe also incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a transaction using a different currency than its functional currency. We attempt to reduce currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into a material transaction in a currency other its functional currency by:\n\u2022matching cash receipts and payments in the same currency;\n\u2022direct foreign currency borrowing; and\n\u2022entering into foreign exchange contracts for hedging purposes.\nHowever, we may not be able to hedge this risk completely or at an acceptable cost, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.\nOur leverage may impair our operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our total consolidated debt was $407.2 million as compared to consolidated debt of $310.9 million as of December 31, 2020.\nOn March 25, 2019, we and certain of our subsidiaries (the \u201cLoan Parties\u201d) entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cABL Credit Agreement\u201d) with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative and collateral agent, and certain financial institutions party thereto as lenders, providing for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) of up to $275.0 million. The borrowing capacity under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is based on the value of inventory, accounts receivable and fixed assets of the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties\u2019 obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are secured on a first-priority bases, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, by substantially all of the personal property and fee-owned real property of the Loan Parties. The liens securing the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are senior in priority to the second-priority liens securing the obligations under the 2026 Notes and the related guarantees. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility has a term of five years and includes a $75.0 million letter of credit sub-facility, $10.0 million of which is available to our German subsidiary that is a borrower under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility.\nAdditionally, on March 25, 2019, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into an indenture with U.S. Bank National Association as trustee and notes collateral agent, pursuant to which we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured second lien notes due on April 1, 2026 with an annual coupon rate of 9.000% (the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d). Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable in cash semi-annual in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2026 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured second lien basis, jointly and severally, by each of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries that is either a guarantor or a borrower under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or that guarantees certain other debt of us or a guarantor. The 2026 Notes and the related guarantees are secured on a second-priority basis, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, by pledges of capital stock and other equity interests and other security interests in substantially all of the personal property and fee-owned real property of us and of the guarantors that secure obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe amount of debt we maintain could have consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest rather than to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the end markets in which we operate.\nThe agreements governing our debt include covenants that restrict, among other matters, our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends or repurchase our equity, make certain investments, and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. Certain of our debt facilities require or will require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, as a result of various factors including the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Adhering to these covenants may also require that we take disadvantageous actions, including reducing spending on marketing, advertising and new product innovation, reducing future financing for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. Our leverage could also put us at a disadvantage compared to any competitors that are less leveraged. We cannot be certain that we will meet any future financial tests or that the lenders would waive any such failure to meet those tests. See additional discussion in Note 12, \u201cDebt,\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf we default under our debt agreements, our lenders could elect, among other potential remedies, to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements to be immediately due and payable and could proceed against any collateral securing the debt.\nExposure to additional tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.\nWe regularly undergo tax audits in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that we prepare our tax filings in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audits, and any related contests thereto, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or contests thereto could have a material adverse effect on operating results and/or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties and/or interest assessments.\nWe face risks associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.\nWe have both funded and unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans worldwide. As of December 31, 2021, our projected benefit obligations under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately $84.6 million (\u201cunfunded status\u201d), as compared to $106.6 million as of December 31, 2020. Estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these benefit plans are based on various assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, rates of compensation increases, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare cost trend rates. If our assumptions prove incorrect, our funding obligations may increase, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have invested the plan assets of our funded benefit plans in various equity and debt securities. A deterioration in the value of plan assets could cause the unfunded status of these benefit plans to increase, thereby increasing our obligation to make additional contributions to these plans. An obligation to make contributions to our benefit plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses, and may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nEnvironmental liabilities that may arise could be material.\nOur operations, facilities and properties are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contamination, and otherwise relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment. As a result, we are involved from time to time in administrative or legal proceedings relating to environmental and health and safety matters and have in the past and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures relating to such matters. For example, we are engaged in confidential discussions with the United States government concerning our participation in the Environmental Protection Agency's Transition Program for Equipment Manufacturers and related matters. See additional discussion regarding this matter in Note 19, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe cannot be certain that identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities or other unanticipated events will not arise in the future and give rise to additional environmental liabilities, compliance costs and/or penalties that could be material. Further, environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and it is impossible to predict accurately the effect they may have upon our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, increasing laws and regulations dealing with environmental aspects of the products we manufacture can result in significant expenditures in designing and manufacturing new products that satisfy such new laws and regulations. In particular, climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gas emissions. While additional regulation of emissions in the future appears likely, how such new regulations would ultimately affect our business, operations or financial results is unknown at this time.\nIf we do not meet customers\u2019 product quality, reliability standards and expectations, we may experience increased or unexpected product warranty claims and other adverse consequences to our business.\nProduct quality and reliability are significant factors influencing customers' decisions to purchase our products. Inability to maintain the high quality of our products relative to the perceived or actual quality of similar products offered by competitors could result in the loss of market share, loss of revenue, reduced profitability, an increase in warranty costs, government investigations and/or damage to our reputation.\nProduct quality and reliability are determined in part by factors that are not entirely within our control. We depend on our suppliers for parts and components that meet our standards. If our suppliers fail to meet those standards, we may not be able to deliver the quality of products that our customers expect, which may impair our reputation, resulting in lower revenue and higher warranty costs.\nWe provide our customers a warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products we manufacture. Our warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from 12 months to 60 months. If a product fails to comply with the warranty, we may be obligated, at our expense, to correct any defect by repairing or replacing the defective product. Although we maintain warranty reserves in an amount based primarily on the number of units shipped\nand on historical and anticipated warranty claims, there can be no assurance that future warranty claims will follow historical patterns or that we can accurately anticipate the level of future warranty claims. An increase in the rate of warranty claims or the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims, for which we are not insured or where we cannot recover from our vendors to the extent their materials or workmanship were defective, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our manufacturing processes and products do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, or if we manufacture products containing design or manufacturing defects, demand for our products may decline and we may be subject to product liability claims.\nOur designs, manufacturing processes and facilities need to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. We may also have the responsibility to ensure that products we design satisfy safety and regulatory standards including those applicable to our customers and to obtain any necessary certifications. As a result, products that we manufacture may at times contain manufacturing or design defects, and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements or demands of our customers. Potential defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, manufacturing or component failure or error, or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, may result in delayed shipments to customers, replacement costs or reduced or canceled customer orders. If these defects or deficiencies are significant, our business reputation may also be damaged. The failure of the products that we manufacture or our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may subject us to legal fines or penalties and, in some cases, require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing process or facility.\nAny manufacturing or design defects may also result in product liability claims. Furthermore, customers use some of our products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property, equipment or the environment. We may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident occurs at a location where our equipment and services have been or are being used. Certain of our businesses also have experienced claims relating to past alleged asbestos exposure. We have not to date incurred material costs related to these asbestos claims. We vigorously defend ourselves against current claims and intend to do so against future claims. We also maintain certain insurance policies which may limit our financial exposures. Any significant liabilities which are not covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. Likewise, a substantial increase in the number of claims that are made against us or the amounts of any judgments or settlements could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompliance or the failure to comply with regulations and governmental policies could cause us to incur significant expense.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations. We are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments, including non-U.S. governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, we may need to obtain and maintain licenses and permits to conduct business in various jurisdictions. If we or the businesses or companies we acquire have failed or fail in the future to comply with such laws and regulations, then we could incur liabilities and fines and our operations could be suspended. Such laws and regulations could also restrict our ability to modify or expand our facilities, could require us to acquire costly equipment, or could impose other significant expenditures.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe must comply with all applicable international trade, customs, export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws that generally bar bribes or gifts to foreign governments or officials. The existing presidential administration in the United States has taken, and make take additional, actions that may inhibit international trade by U.S.-based companies. Changes in trade sanctions laws may restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned parties, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. Violation of these laws or regulations could\nresult in sanctions or fines and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or maintain our rights to use licensed intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur intellectual property, including our patents, trade secrets, trademarks and licenses are important in the operation of our business. Although we intend to protect our intellectual property rights vigorously, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in doing so. Third parties may assert or prosecute infringement claims against us in connection with the services and products that we offer, and we may or may not be able to successfully defend these claims. Litigation, either to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others, could result in substantial costs and in a diversion of our resources. In addition, if a third party would prevail in an infringement claim against us, then we would likely need to obtain a license from the third party on commercial terms, which would likely increase our costs. Our failure to maintain or obtain necessary licenses or an adverse outcome in any litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 51263, "SIC": 3530, "TIC": "MTW"}
