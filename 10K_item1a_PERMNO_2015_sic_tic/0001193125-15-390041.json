{"cik": "794172", "company": "MERIDIAN BIOSCIENCE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-11-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or future results. Any one of these factors could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nRisks Affecting Growth and Profitability of our Business\nWe may be unable to develop new products and services or acquire products and services on favorable terms.\nThe medical diagnostic and life science industries are characterized by ongoing technological developments and changing customer requirements. As such, our results of operations and continued growth depend, in part, on our ability in a timely manner to develop or acquire rights to, and successfully introduce into the marketplace, enhancements of existing products and services or new products and services that incorporate technological advances, meet customer requirements and/or respond to products developed by our competition. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in developing or acquiring such rights to products and services on a timely basis, or that such products and services will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, we must regularly allocate considerable resources to research and development of new products, services and technologies. The research and development process generally takes a significant amount of time from design stage to product launch. This process is conducted in various stages. During each stage, there is a risk that we will not achieve our goals on a timely basis, or at all, and we may have to abandon a product in which we have invested substantial resources.\n- 17 -\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate operations or to achieve expected cost savings from acquisitions we make.\nOne of our growth strategies is the acquisition of companies and/or products. Although additional acquisitions of companies and products may enhance the opportunity to increase net earnings over time, such acquisitions could result in greater administrative burdens, increased exposure to the uncertainties inherent in marketing new products and financial risks of additional operating costs. The principal benefits expected to result from any acquisitions we make will not be achieved fully unless we are able to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired entities with our operations and realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating these businesses into our existing businesses. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to identify and complete additional acquisitions on terms we consider favorable or that, if completed, will be successfully integrated into our operations.\nRevenues for our Diagnostics segment may be impacted by our reliance upon two key distributors in North America, seasonal factors and sporadic outbreaks, and changing diagnostic market conditions.\nKey Distributors\nOur Diagnostics segment\u2019s revenues from sales through two U.S. distributors were 37% and 36%, respectively, of the Diagnostics segment\u2019s total revenues for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, or 28% and 27%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. These parties distribute our products and other laboratory products to end-user customers. The loss of either of these distributors could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations unless suitable alternatives were timely found or lost sales to one distributor were absorbed by another distributor. Finding a suitable alternative on satisfactory terms may pose challenges in our industry\u2019s competitive environment. As an alternative, we could expand our efforts to distribute and market our products directly. This alternative, however, would require substantial investment in additional sales, marketing and logistics resources, including hiring additional sales and customer service personnel, which would significantly increase our future selling, general and administrative expenses, but would not necessarily result in lower net income levels.\nIn addition, buying patterns of these two distributors may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, potentially leading to uneven concentration levels on a quarterly basis.\nSeasonal Factors and Sporadic Outbreaks\nOur principal business is the sale of a broad range of diagnostic test kits for common gastrointestinal, viral, upper respiratory and parasitic infectious diseases. Certain infectious diseases may be seasonal in nature, while others may be associated with sporadic outbreaks, such as foodborne illnesses, or pandemics such as H1N1 influenza. While we believe that the breadth of our diagnostic product lines reduces the risk that infections subject to seasonality and sporadic outbreaks will cause significant variability in diagnostic revenues, we can make no assurance that revenues will not be negatively impacted period over period by such factors.\n- 18 -\nChanging Diagnostic Market Conditions\nChanges in the U.S. health care delivery system have resulted in consolidation among reference laboratories and the formation of multi-hospital alliances, reducing the number of institutional customers for diagnostic test products. Consolidation in the U.S. health care industry has also led to the creation of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) and integrated delivery networks (IDNs) that aggregate buying power for hospital groups and put pressure on our selling prices. Due to such consolidation, we may not be able to enter into and/or sustain contractual or other marketing or distribution arrangements on a satisfactory commercial basis with institutional customers, GPOs and IDNs, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by health care reform legislation.\nThird-party payers for medical products and services, including state, federal and foreign governments, are increasingly concerned about escalating health care costs and can indirectly affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement they will provide for diagnostic testing services. Following years of increasing pressure, during 2010 the U.S. government enacted comprehensive health care reform. At present, we are unable to predict what effect the legislation might ultimately have on reimbursement rates for our products. If reimbursement amounts for diagnostic testing services are decreased in the future, such decreases may reduce the amount that will be reimbursed to hospitals or physicians for such services and consequently, could place constraints on the levels of overall pricing, which could have a material effect on our revenues and/or results of operations.\nIn addition, on January 1, 2013, the medical device tax established as part of the U.S. health care reform legislation became effective and as a result, the Company made its first required tax deposit near the end of January 2013. During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recorded approximately $1,900, $1,750 and $1,300, respectively, of Medical Device Tax expense, which is reflected as a component of cost of sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nEfforts to reduce the U.S. federal deficit could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs part of the Budget Control Act passed in August 2011 to extend the federal debt limit and reduce government spending, $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts (known as sequestration) were implemented in 2013. The sequestration requires a 2% cut in Medicare payments for all services, including our diagnostic tests, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2024 unless Congressional action is otherwise taken. Government research funding has also been reduced as a result of the sequestration. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 also was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduces Medicare payments to providers such as hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increases the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\n- 19 -\nSuch reductions in government health care spending or research funding could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. Further, there is ongoing uncertainty regarding the federal budget and federal spending levels, including the possible impacts of a failure to increase the \u201cdebt ceiling.\u201d Any U.S. government default on its debt could have broad macroeconomic effects that could, among other things, raise our borrowing costs. Any future shutdown of the federal government or failure to enact annual appropriations could also have a material adverse impact on our business.\nRevenues for our Life Science segment may be impacted by customer concentrations and buying patterns.\nOur Life Science segment\u2019s revenues from sales of purified antigens and reagents to two diagnostic manufacturing customers were 16% of the Life Science segment\u2019s total revenues for each of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, or 4% of our consolidated revenues for each of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. Our Life Science segment has four other significant customers who purchase antigens, antibodies and reagents, which together comprised 10% and 8%, respectively, of the segment\u2019s total revenues for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. Any significant alteration of buying patterns from these customers could adversely affect our period over period revenues and results of operations.\nRevenues relating to research, development and manufacturing services for our Life Science segment are generated on a contract by contract basis. The nature of this business is such that each contract provides a unique product and/or service and corresponding revenue stream. While this business has historically generated annual revenues of approximately $2,000 to $4,000, there can be no assurance that future contracts will be secured, and if secured, will be profitable.\nIntense competition could adversely affect our profitability.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by substantial competition and rapid change. Hundreds of companies around the world supply diagnostic tests and immunoassay and molecular reagents. These companies range from multinational health care entities, for which diagnostics is one line of business, to small start-up companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. We cannot provide any assurance that our products and services will be able to compete successfully with the products and services of our competitors.\n- 20 -\nWe may face increased competition upon expiration of our H. pylori patents in 2016 and 2017.\nOur patents related to our H. pylori products expire in May 2016 in the U.S. and in 2017 in countries outside the U.S. Revenues from our H. pylori products were approximately $30,000 in fiscal 2015. We expect competition with respect to our H. pylori products to increase upon the expiration of these patents in 2016 and 2017 as we currently market the only FDA-cleared test to detect H. pylori antigen in stool samples. Such competition may have an adverse impact on our selling prices for these products and our ability to retain business at prices acceptable to us, and consequently, adversely affect our future results of operations and liquidity, including revenues and gross profit. In order to mitigate any loss in revenues upon patent expiration, among other things, we are researching and experimenting with new products (e.g., detection of H. pylori on molecular platforms) and attempting to secure significant customers under long-term contracts. We are unable to provide any assurances that we will be successful with any mitigation strategy or that any mitigation strategy will prevent an adverse effect on our future results of operations and liquidity, including revenues and gross profit.\nWe depend on international revenues, and our financial results may be adversely impacted by foreign currency, regulatory or other developments affecting international markets.\nWe sell products and services into approximately 70 countries. Approximately 25% and 29% of our net revenues for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, were attributable to markets outside of North America. For fiscal 2015, approximately 35% of our international revenues were from sales made in Euros and 40% were from sales made in U.S. dollars, with the remaining 25% primarily being a combination of sales made in British pounds, Australian dollars and Singapore dollars. We are subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates for the Australian dollar, British pound, Euro and Singapore dollar to the U.S. dollar. We are also subject to other risks associated with international operations, including longer customer payment cycles, tariff regulations, requirements for export licenses, instability of foreign governments, and governmental requirements with respect to the importation and distribution of medical devices and immunodiagnostic and molecular biology reagents, all of which may vary by country.\nRisks Affecting our Manufacturing Operations\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation, and our ability to earn profits may be restricted by these regulations.\nMedical device diagnostics is a highly regulated industry. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary governmental clearances or approvals or timely clearances or approvals to market future products in the United States and other countries. Costs and difficulties in complying with laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, the Centers for Disease Control or other regulators can result in unanticipated expenses and delays and interruptions to the sale of new and existing products.\nRegulatory approval can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, making the timing and costs of approvals difficult to predict. The failure to comply with these regulations can result in delays in obtaining authorization to sell products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of authority to manufacture or sell products, and other civil or criminal sanctions.\n- 21 -\nSignificant interruptions in production at our principal manufacturing facilities and/or third-party manufacturing facilities would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nProducts and services manufactured at facilities we own or lease comprised a majority of our revenues. Our global supply of these products and services is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. In addition, we currently rely on a small number of third-party manufacturers to produce certain of our diagnostic products and product components. The operations of our facilities or these third-party manufacturing facilities could be adversely affected by power failures, natural or other disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, tornadoes or terrorist threats. Although we carry insurance to protect against certain business interruptions at our facilities, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. Any significant interruption in the Company\u2019s or a third-party supplier\u2019s manufacturing capabilities could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe depend on sole-source suppliers for certain critical raw materials and components, and finished products. A supply interruption could adversely affect our business.\nRaw Materials and Components\nOur diagnostic products are made from a wide variety of raw materials that are biological or chemical in nature, and that generally are available from multiple sources of supply. We sole-source certain raw materials and components due to FDA regulations, which make it time consuming and costly to switch raw materials and components in FDA cleared products. If certain suppliers fail to supply required raw materials or components, we will need to secure other sources which may require us to conduct additional development and testing and obtain regulatory approval. These activities require significant time and resources, and there is no assurance that new sources will be secured or regulatory approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.\nOne third party manufactures our proprietary illumipro-10\u2122 Incubator Reader (instrument), a component of our illumigene molecular system. This instrument is manufactured exclusively for Meridian according to our specifications. While other manufacturers for this type of instrument are available, we source solely from one manufacturer due to the FDA regulations and costs involved in clearing the system for marketing in the United States. If this third-party manufacturer fails to supply us with instruments, we will need to secure another manufacturer, and it may take as long as 12 months to transfer instrument manufacturing. As revenues for our illumigene molecular system accounted for $41,000 or 21% of consolidated revenues for fiscal 2015, $37,000 or 20% for fiscal 2014 and $34,000 or 18% for fiscal 2013, an interruption in the manufacturing of this system could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAdditionally, one third party manufactures one certain reagent for use with our illumigene assays. While alternative suppliers exist, we elect to utilize this third party exclusively in order to maintain consistency in our materials, which is critical in complying with FDA regulatory requirements.\n- 22 -\nFinished Products\nWe outsource the manufacturing for certain finished diagnostic products to third parties. A disruption in the supply of these finished products could have a material adverse effect on our business until we find another supplier or bring manufacturing in-house.\nFour products manufactured exclusively for us by three separate and independent companies accounted for 18%, 17% and 17% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Meridian owns all rights and title to the FDA 510(k) clearances for these products.\nActivities undertaken by Meridian to reduce the risk of these sole-supplier arrangements include maintaining adequate inventory levels, supplier qualification procedures, supplier audits, site visits and frequent communication. Additionally, we have identified potential alternate suppliers.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Product Liability\nWe may be unable to protect or obtain proprietary rights that we utilize or intend to utilize.\nIn developing and manufacturing our products, we employ a variety of proprietary and patented technologies. In addition, we have licensed, and expect to continue to license, various complementary technologies and methods from academic institutions and public and private companies. We cannot provide any assurance that the technologies that we own or license provide protection from competitive threats or from challenges to our intellectual property. In addition, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in obtaining and retaining licenses or proprietary or patented technologies in the future.\nProduct infringement claims by other companies could result in costly disputes and could limit our ability to sell our products.\nLitigation over intellectual property rights is prevalent in the diagnostic industry. As the market for diagnostics continues to grow and the number of participants in the market increases, we may increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims. It is possible that a third party may claim infringement against us. If found to infringe, we may attempt to obtain a license to such intellectual property; however, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, if our products are found to infringe on third-party intellectual property, we may be required to pay damages for past infringement and lose the ability to sell certain products, causing our revenues to decrease. We currently carry intellectual property insurance that covers damages and defense costs from our potential infringement on certain other third-party patents at levels that we believe are commercially reasonable, although there is no assurance that it will be adequate to cover claims that may arise. Any substantial underinsured loss resulting from such a claim could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and the damage to our reputation in the industry could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n- 23 -\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may have to limit or cease sales of our products.\nThe testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical diagnostic products involves an inherent risk of product liability claims. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or cease sales of our products. We currently carry product liability insurance at a level we believe is commercially reasonable, although there is no assurance that it will be adequate to cover claims that may arise. In certain customer contracts, we indemnify third parties for certain product liability claims related to our products. These indemnification obligations may cause us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications. In addition, a defect in the design or manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and subject us to claims of liability for injury and otherwise. Any substantial underinsured loss resulting from such a claim could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, and the damage to our reputation in the industry could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOther Risks Affecting Our Business\nOur business could be negatively affected if we are unable to attract, hire and retain key personnel.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain highly qualified personnel, including our executive officers and scientific, technical, sales and marketing employees, and their ability to manage growth successfully. If such key employees were to leave and we were unable to obtain adequate replacements, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur bank credit agreement imposes restrictions with respect to our operations.\nOur bank credit agreement contains a number of financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and tests. If we fail to comply with the obligations in the credit agreement, we would be in default under the credit agreement. If an event of default is not cured or waived, it could result in acceleration of any indebtedness under our credit agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. At the present time, no borrowings are outstanding under our bank credit agreement.\nWe face risks related to global economic conditions.\nWe currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets, provides us with discretionary funding capacity for research and development and other strategic activities. However, as an enterprise with global operations and markets, our operations and financial performance are in part dependent upon global economic conditions, and we could be negatively impacted by a global, regional or national economic crisis, including sovereign risk in the event of deterioration in the credit worthiness of or a default by local governments. We are particularly susceptible to the economic conditions in countries where government-sponsored health care systems are the primary payers for health care, including those countries within the European Union that are reducing their public expenditures in an effort to achieve cost savings. The uncertainty in global economic conditions poses a risk to the overall economy that could impact demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors, including financial institutions. As such, if global economic conditions deteriorate significantly, our business could be negatively impacted, including such areas as reduced demand for our products from a slow-down in the general economy, supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets, and/or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. While to-date such factors have not had a significant negative impact on our results or operations, we continue to monitor and plan for the potential impact of these global economic factors.\n- 24 -\nApproximately $1,600 and $2,700 of our accounts receivable at September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, respectively, was due from Italian hospital customers whose funding ultimately comes from the Italian government. In addition, the amount of our annual revenues in the country of Greece and the corresponding amount of customer receivables outstanding at any point in time is not significant, and therefore, we do not expect any meaningful impact from the financial crisis in the country of Greece.\nBreaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Like many multinational corporations, our information technology systems may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber- or phishing-attacks. We also store certain information with third parties that could be subject to these types of attacks. Such attacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being lost or stolen, disruption of our operations, and other negative consequences, such as increased costs for security measures or remediation costs, and diversion of management attention. While we will continue to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of and detect cyber incidents, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. There can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent attacks that could have a significant impact on our business.\nNatural disasters, war and other events could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income.\nNatural disasters (including pandemics), war, terrorism, labor disruptions and international conflicts, and actions taken by the United States and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events, could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the United States and in areas outside of the United States in which we operate. These events could result in decreased demand for our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities, or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers.\n- 25 -\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of such shares without any future vote or action by the shareholders. The issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. Ohio corporation law contains provisions that may discourage takeover bids for our company that have not been negotiated with the board of directors. Such provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, sales of substantial amounts of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital at a price favorable to us.", "PERMNO": 10530, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "VIVO"}
