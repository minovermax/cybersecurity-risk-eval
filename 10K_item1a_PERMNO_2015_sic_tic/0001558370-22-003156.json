{"cik": "1288403", "company": "W&T OFFSHORE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to us and our industry could materially impact our future performance and results of operations. We have provided below a list of known material risk factors that should be reviewed when considering buying or selling our securities. These are not all the risks we face, and other factors currently considered immaterial or unknown to us may impact our future operations.\nMarket and Competitive Risks\nCrude oil, natural gas and NGL prices can fluctuate widely due to a number of factors that are beyond our control. Depressed oil, natural gas or NGL prices adversely affects our business, financial condition, cash flow, liquidity or results of operations and could affect our ability to fund future capital expenditures needed to find and replace reserves, meet our financial commitments and to implement our business strategy.\nThe price we receive for our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production directly affects our revenues, profitability, access to capital, ability to produce these commodities economically and future rate of growth. Historically, oil, NGLs and natural gas prices have been volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to domestic and global changes in supply and demand, economic and legal forces, events and uncertainties, and numerous other factors beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf changes in global supply and demand for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u25cf events that impact global market demand (e.g. the reduced demand experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic);\n\u25cf the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other major oil producing countries (\u201cOPEC Plus\u201d);\n\u25cf the price and quantity of imports of foreign crude oil, NGLs, natural gas and liquefied natural gas into the U.S.;\n\u25cf acts of war, terrorism or political instability in oil producing countries (e.g. the recent invasion of parts of Ukraine by Russia);\n\u25cf domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u25cf political conditions and events, including embargoes and moratoriums, affecting oil-producing activities;\n\u25cf the level of domestic and global oil and natural gas exploration and production activities;\n\u25cf the level of global crude oil, NGLs and natural gas inventories;\n\u25cf adverse weather conditions;\n\u25cf technological advances affecting energy consumption and the availability and cost of alternative energy sources;\n\u25cf the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels;\n\u25cf speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u25cf cyberattacks on our information infrastructure or systems controlling offshore equipment;\n\u25cf activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration and production of oil and natural gas so as to minimize or eliminate future emissions of carbon dioxide, methane gas and other GHG;\n\u25cf the effect of energy conservation efforts;\n\u25cf the availability of pipeline and other transportation alternatives and third party processing capacity; and\n\u25cf geographic differences in pricing.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets, which we expect to continue, make it extremely difficult to predict future commodity prices with any certainty.\nIf crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices decrease from their current levels, we may be required to further reduce the estimated volumes and future value associated with our total proved reserves or record impairments to the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties.\nLower future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices may reduce our estimates of the proved reserve volumes that may be economically recovered, which would reduce the total volumes and future value of our proved reserves. Under\nthe full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities, a ceiling test is performed at the end of each quarter to determine if our oil and gas properties have been impaired. Capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are generally limited to the present value of future net revenues of proved reserves based on the average price of the 12-month period prior to the ending date of each quarterly assessment using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. Impairments of our oil and gas properties are more likely to occur during prolonged periods of depressed crude oil, NGL and natural gas pricing. While we have not recorded an impairment of our oil and gas properties during the year-ended December 31, 2021, any further decreases in commodity pricing could cause an impairment, which would result in a non-cash charge to earnings.\nCommodity derivative positions may limit our potential gains.\nIn order to manage our exposure to price risk in the marketing of our oil and natural gas, we have entered, and may continue to enter, into oil and natural gas price commodity derivative positions with respect to a portion of our expected future production. See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data- Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information on our derivative contracts and transactions. We may enter into more derivative contracts in the future. While these commodity derivative positions are intended to reduce the effects of crude oil and natural gas price volatility, they may also limit future income if crude oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by such positions. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery points assumed in the hedge arrangements or the counterparties to the derivative contracts fail to perform under the terms of the contracts.\nCompetition for oil and natural gas properties and prospects is intense; some of our competitors have larger financial, technical and personnel resources that may give them an advantage in evaluating and obtaining properties and prospects.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for reviewing prospects, acquiring properties, marketing oil, NGLs and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors have financial resources that allow them to obtain substantially greater technical expertise and personnel than we have. We actively compete with other companies in our industry when acquiring new leases or oil and natural gas properties. For example, new leases acquired from the BOEM are acquired through a \u201csealed bid\u201d process and are generally awarded to the highest bidder. Our competitors may be able to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our competitors may also be able to pay more to acquire productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects than we are able or willing to pay or finance. Finally, companies with larger financial resources may have a significant advantage in terms of meeting any potential new bonding requirements. If we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future, our future revenues and growth may be diminished or restricted.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The marketability of our production depends mostly upon the availability, proximity, and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities, which in some cases are owned by third parties.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends substantially on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities, which in some cases are owned and operated by third parties.\nWe depend upon third-party pipelines that provide delivery options from our facilities. Because we do not own or operate these pipelines, their continued operation is not within our control. These pipelines may become unavailable for a number of reasons, including testing, maintenance, capacity constraints, accidents, government regulation, weather-related events or other third-party actions. If any of these third-party pipelines become partially or fully unavailable to\ntransport crude oil and natural gas, or if the gas quality specification for the natural gas pipelines changes so as to restrict our ability to transport natural gas on those pipelines, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nA portion of our oil and natural gas is processed for sale on platforms owned by third parties with no economic interest in our wells and no other processing facilities would be available to process such oil and natural gas without significant investment by us. In addition, third-party platforms could be damaged or destroyed by hurricanes which could reduce or eliminate our ability to market our production. As of December 31, 2021, four fields, accounting for approximately 0.3 MMBoe (or 2.5%) of our 2021 production, are tied back to separate, third-party owned platforms. There can be no assurance that the owners of such platforms will continue to process our oil and natural gas production.\nWe may be required to shut in wells because of a reduction in demand for our production or because of inadequacy or unavailability of pipelines, gathering system capacity or processing facilities. If that were to occur, then we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until arrangements were made to process or deliver our production to market. We have, in the past, been required to shut in wells when hurricanes have caused or threatened damage to pipelines, gathering stations, and production facilities. In addition, certain third-party pipelines have submitted requests in the past to increase the fees they charge us to use these pipelines. These increased fees, if approved, could adversely impact our revenues or increase our operating costs, either of which would adversely impact our operating profits, cash flows and reserves.\nOperating Risks\nRelatively short production periods for our Gulf of Mexico properties based on proved reserves subject us to high reserve replacement needs and require significant capital expenditures to replace our proved reserves at a faster rate than companies whose proved reserves have longer production periods. If we are not able to obtain new oil and gas leases or replace reserves, we will not be able to sustain production at current levels, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable in order to replace or grow our produced proved reserves. Producing oil and natural gas reserves are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. High production rates generally result in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves during the initial few years of production. All of our current production is from the Gulf of Mexico. Proved reserves in the Gulf of Mexico generally have shorter reserve lives than proved reserves in many other producing regions of the United States in part due to the difference in rules related to booking proved undeveloped reserves between conventional and unconventional basins. Our independent petroleum consultant estimates that 27.3% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 will be depleted within three years. As a result, our need to replace proved reserves and production from new investments is relatively greater than that of producers who recover lower percentages of their proved reserves over a similar time period, such as those producers who have a larger portion of their proved reserves in areas other than the Gulf of Mexico. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures and acquisitions with cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, capital markets securities offerings and bank borrowings. The capital markets we have historically accessed may be constrained because of our leverage and also because, in recent years, institutional investors who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies have become more attentive to sustainability lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies, and we may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional proved reserves in sufficient quantities to sustain our current production levels or to grow production beyond current levels. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas, and our success in developing and producing new reserves. Any reductions in our capital expenditures to stay within internally generated cash flow (which could be adversely affected if commodity prices decline) and cash on hand will make replacing depleted reserves more difficult.\nLosses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured drilling and operating activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nWe are and could be exposed to uninsured losses in the future. We currently carry multiple layers of insurance coverage in our Energy Package (defined as certain insurance policies relating to our oil and gas properties which\ninclude named windstorm coverage) covering our operating activities, with higher limits of coverage for higher valued properties and wells. Our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks. We do not carry business interruption insurance. Pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable, as gradual seepage and pollution are not covered under our policies. Because third-party drilling contractors are used to drill our wells, we may not realize the full benefit of workmen\u2019s compensation laws in dealing with their employees.\nCurrently OPA requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to have ready access to between $35.0 million and $150.0 million, which amount is based on a worst case oil spill discharge volume demonstration that can be used to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill at our facilities on the OCS. We are currently required to demonstrate that we have ready access to $35.0 million. If OPA is amended to increase the minimum level of financial responsibility, we may experience difficulty in providing financial assurances sufficient to comply with this requirement.\nFor some risks, we have not obtained insurance as we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. We reevaluate the purchase of insurance, policy limits and terms annually. Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable, and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Insurance Coverage under Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for additional information on insurance coverage.\nWe conduct exploration, development and production operations on the deep shelf and in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, which presents unique operating risks.\nThe deep shelf and the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico are areas that have had less drilling activity due, in part, to their geological complexity, depth and higher cost to drill and ultimately develop. There are additional risks associated with deep shelf and deepwater drilling that could result in substantial cost overruns and/or result in uneconomic projects or wells. Deeper targets are more difficult to interpret with traditional seismic processing. Moreover, drilling costs and the risk of mechanical failure are significantly higher because of the additional depth and adverse conditions, such as high temperature and pressure. For example, the drilling of deepwater wells requires specific types of rigs with significantly higher day rates as compared to the rigs used in shallower water, sophisticated sea floor production handling equipment, expensive state-of-the-art platforms and infrastructure investments. Deepwater wells have greater mechanical risks because the wellhead equipment is installed on the sea floor. In addition, due to the significant time requirements involved with exploration and development activities, particularly for wells in the deepwater or wells not located near existing infrastructure, actual oil and natural gas production from new wells may not occur, if at all, for a considerable period of time following the commencement of any particular project. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that our oil and natural gas exploration activities in the deep shelf, the deepwater and elsewhere will be commercially successful.\nWe may not be in a position to control the timing of development efforts, associated costs or the rate of production of the reserves from our non-operated properties.\nAs we carry out our drilling program, we may not serve as operator of all planned wells. In that case, we have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of some non-operated properties and their associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs of properties operated by others could prevent the realization of anticipated results in drilling or acquisition activities.\nOur business involves many uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses.\nThe exploration, development and production of oil and gas properties involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, pipe failure, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards. Environmental hazards include oil spills, gas leaks, pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. Additionally, our offshore operations are subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collisions and adverse weather and sea conditions, including the effects of hurricanes.\nIf we experience any of these problems, well bores, platforms, gathering systems and processing facilities could be affected, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations. If any of these industry operating risks occur, we could have substantial losses. Substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, suspension of operations and production, repairs to resume operations and loss of reserves. Any of these industry operating risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe geographic concentration of our properties in the Gulf of Mexico subjects us to an increased risk of loss of revenues or curtailment of production from factors specifically affecting the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe geographic concentration of our properties along the U.S. Gulf Coast and adjacent waters on and beyond the OCS means that some or all of our properties could be affected by the same event should the Gulf of Mexico experience severe weather, including tropical storms and hurricanes; delays or decreases in production, the availability of equipment, facilities or services; changes in the status of pipelines that we depend on for transportation of our production to the marketplace; delays or decreases in the availability of capacity to transport, gather or process production; and changes in the regulatory environment.\nBecause a majority of our properties could experience the same conditions at the same time, these conditions could have a greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other operators who have properties over a wider geographic area.\nInsurance for well control and hurricane damage may become significantly more expensive for less coverage and some losses currently covered by insurance may not be covered in the future.\nIn the past, hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have caused catastrophic losses and property damage. Well control insurance coverage becomes limited from time to time and the cost of such coverage becomes both more costly and more volatile. In the past, we have been able to renew our policies each annual period, but our coverage has varied depending on the premiums charged, our assessment of the risks and our ability to absorb a portion of the risks. The insurance market may further change dramatically in the future due to hurricane damage, major oil spills or other events.\nIn the future, our insurers may not continue to offer what we view as reasonable coverage, or our costs may increase substantially as a result of increased premiums. There could be an increased risk of uninsured losses that may have been previously insured. We are also exposed to the possibility that in the future we will be unable to buy insurance at any price or that if we do have claims, the insurance companies will not pay our claims. The occurrence of any or all of these possibilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates of our proved reserves depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in the estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities of and present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and the calculation of the present value of our reserves at December 31, 2021.\nIn order to prepare our year-end reserve estimates, our independent petroleum consultant projected our production rates and timing of development expenditures. Our independent petroleum consultant also analyzed available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary and may not be under our control. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as crude oil and natural gas prices, operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise.\nActual future production, crude oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, our independent petroleum consultant may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, drilling results, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure or the present value of future net revenues from our proved oil and natural gas reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted first-day-of-the-month average price for each product and costs in effect on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate.\nProspects that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercial quantities or quantities sufficient to meet our targeted rates of return.\nA prospect is an area in which we own an interest, could acquire an interest or have operating rights, and have what our geoscientists believe, based on available seismic and geological information, to be indications of economic accumulations of oil or natural gas. Our prospects are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a prospect that is ready to be drilled to a prospect that will require substantial seismic data processing and interpretation, which will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. Sustained low crude oil, NGLs and natural gas pricing will also significantly impact the projected rates of return of our projects without the assurance of significant reductions in costs of drilling and development. To the extent we drill additional wells in the deepwater and/or on the deep shelf, our drilling activities could become more expensive. In addition, the geological complexity of deepwater and deep shelf formations may make it more difficult for us to sustain our historical rates of drilling success. As a result, we can offer no assurance that we will find commercial quantities of oil and natural gas and, therefore, we can offer no assurance that we will achieve positive rates of return on our investments.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our industry, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have created significant volatility, uncertainty, and turmoil in the oil and gas industry. The COVID-19 outbreak and the responsive actions to limit the spread of the virus significantly reduced global economic activity in 2020 and 2021, resulting in a decline in the demand for oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As COVID-19 vaccines have been more widely distributed, global economic activity is improving and commodity prices are currently above pre-pandemic levels. However, the energy markets remain subject to heightened levels of volatility and uncertainty as responses to COVID-19 and COVID-19 variants continue to evolve. Disruptions in global demand for oil and natural gas caused by the COVID 19 pandemic may continue to affect us, constraining our ability to store and move production to downstream markets, or affecting future decisions to delay or curtail development activity or temporarily shut-in production which could further reduce cash flow. We will continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic on energy markets in the future.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any other future pandemic on our business will depend on the nature, spread and duration of the disease, the responsive actions to contain its spread or address its effects, its effect on the demand for oil and natural gas, the timing and severity of the related consequences on commodity prices and the economy more generally, including any recession resulting from the pandemic, among other things. Any extended period of depressed commodity prices or general economic disruption as a result of the pandemic would adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the other risks and uncertainties described in this report.\nOur operations could be adversely impacted by security breaches, including cybersecurity breaches, which could affect the systems, processes and data needed to run our business.\nWe rely on our information technology infrastructure and management information systems to operate and record aspects of our business. Although we take measures to protect against cybersecurity risks, including unauthorized access to our confidential and proprietary information, our security measures may not be able to detect or prevent every attempted breach. Similar to other companies, we have experienced cyber-attacks, although we have not suffered any material losses related to such attacks. Security breaches include, among other things, illegal hacking, computer viruses, interference with treasury function, theft or acts of vandalism or terrorism. A breach could result in an interruption in our operations, malfunction of our platform control devices, disabling of our communication links, unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, unauthorized release of customer or employee data, violation of privacy or other laws and exposure to litigation. Any of these security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The recent invasion of parts of Ukraine by Russia, and the impact of world sanctions against Russia and the potential for retaliatory acts from Russia, could result in increased cybersecurity attacks against U.S. companies.\nThe loss of members of our senior management could adversely affect us.\nTo a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management. The loss of the services of any of our senior management could have a negative impact on our operations. We do not maintain or plan to obtain for the benefit of the Company any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. See our definitive proxy statement to be filed with the SEC within 120 days after the end of our fiscal year covered by this Form 10-K for more information regarding our senior management team.\nCapital Risks\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and limited borrowing capacity under our current Credit Agreement. Our leverage and debt service obligations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects, and we may have difficulty paying our debts as they become due.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had Senior Second Lien Notes and a term loan of certain of our subsidiaries that is non-recourse to the Company (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d). We have no borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility under our Credit Agreement, which lending commitment and final maturity is set to expire on January 3, 2023. The Senior Second Lien Notes mature on November 1, 2023.\nOur leverage and debt service obligations could:\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including reduced demand during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf limit our ability to fund future working capital requirements, capital expenditures and ARO, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets;\n\u25cf limit our opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of interest and principal on our debt obligations or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt obligations;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf limit or impair our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing in the future or require us to seek alternative financing, which may be more restrictive or expensive; and\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nAny of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we face could intensify. Additionally, availability of borrowings and letters of credit under our Credit Agreement is determined by establishment of a borrowing base, which is periodically redetermined in lender\u2019s sole discretion based on our lenders\u2019 review of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, our proved reserves and other criteria. Lower crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices in the future would also adversely affect our cash flow and could result in reductions in our borrowing base and sources of alternate credit and affect our ability to satisfy the covenants and ratios required by the Credit Agreement and Indenture.\nWe cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt or otherwise meet our future obligations. In such scenarios, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, obtain new financing or issue equity. However, we may not be able to accomplish any of these transactions on terms acceptable to us or such actions may not yield sufficient capital to meet our obligations. Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our abilities to incur certain additional debt or liens or engage in other transactions, which could limit growth and our ability to respond to changing conditions.\nThe Indenture, our Credit Agreement and our Subsidiary Credit Agreement governing our indebtedness contain a number of significant restrictive covenants in addition to covenants restricting the incurrence of additional debt. These covenants limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries, among other things, to:\n\u25cf make loans and investments;\n\u25cf incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\u25cf create certain liens;\n\u25cf sell assets;\n\u25cf enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u25cf consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of our company;\n\u25cf engage in transactions with our affiliates;\n\u25cf pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or indebtedness; and\n\u25cf create unrestricted subsidiaries.\nOur Credit Agreement requires us, among other things, to maintain certain financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. These restrictions may also limit our ability to obtain future financings, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us from the restrictive covenants under our indentures governing our outstanding notes and our Credit Agreement.\nA breach of any covenant in the agreements governing our debt would result in a default under such agreement after any applicable grace periods. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under such agreement and in a default with respect to, and acceleration of, the debt outstanding under any other debt agreements. The accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable. If that should occur, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such accelerated debt. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nIf we default on our secured debt, the value of the collateral securing our secured debt may not be sufficient to ensure repayment of all of such debt.\nOur Credit Agreement and our outstanding Second Lien Senior Notes are secured by various liens on our oil, natural gas and NGL properties, excluding our Mobile Bay properties. Our Senior Second Lien Notes are secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of such properties. The oil and gas assets of, and equity in, certain of our subsidiaries that own our Mobile Bay assets (the Borrower Subsidiaries, as defined in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 - Debt under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K), are pledged on a first priority basis to secure our Term Loan. Any future borrowings under our Credit Agreement would be secured on a first priority basis by the assets securing the Second Lien Term Notes. In addition, we have certain rights to issue or incur additional or new secured debt, that could be secured by additional liens on the collateral and an issuance or incurrence of such additional secured debt would dilute the value of the collateral securing our outstanding secured debt. If the proceeds of the sale of the collateral securing the Senior Second Lien Notes or any future indebtedness incurred under the Credit Agreement are not sufficient to repay all amounts due in respect of such debt, then claims against our remaining assets to repay any amounts still outstanding under our secured obligations would be unsecured and our ability to pay our other unsecured obligations and any distributions in respect of our capital stock would be significantly impaired.\nWith respect to some of the collateral securing our debt, any collateral trustee\u2019s security interest and ability to foreclose on the collateral will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining third party consents, paying court fees that may be based on the principal amount of the parity lien obligations and making additional filings. If we are unable to obtain these consents, pay such fees or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid, and the applicable holders and lenders will not be entitled to the collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain collateral in any foreclosure and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the collateral.\nWe may be required to post cash collateral pursuant to our agreements with sureties under our existing or future bonding arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to execute our capital expenditure plan, our ARO plan and comply with our existing debt instruments.\nPursuant to the terms of our agreements with various sureties under our existing bonding arrangements, or under any future bonding arrangements we may enter into, we may be required to post collateral at any time, on demand, at the surety\u2019s sole discretion. Additional collateral would likely be in the form of cash or letters of credit. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to satisfy collateral demands for current bonds or for future bonds.\nIf we are required to provide additional collateral, our liquidity position will be negatively impacted, and we may be required to seek alternative financing. To the extent we are unable to secure adequate financing, we may be forced to reduce our capital expenditures in the current year or future years, may be unable to execute our ARO plan or may be unable to comply with our existing debt instruments.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe Biden Administration may pursue significant regulatory and political actions that could adversely affect our results of operations, and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nPresident Biden has made addressing the threat of climate change from GHG emissions a priority under his Administration. Regulatory agencies under the Biden Administration have issued proposed rulemakings, and may issue new or amended rulemakings in support of President Biden\u2019s regulatory and political agenda, which include reducing dependence on, and use of, fossil fuels and curtailment of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. Our operations in the Gulf of Mexico require permits from federal and state governmental agencies in order to perform drilling and completion activities and conduct other regulated activities and the Biden Administration may continue pursuing actions that delay or refuse approval of new leases for hydrocarbon exploration and development on federal lands and waters or delay or fail to grant approvals required for development of existing leases on such lands and waters. See Part I, Item 1, Business - Compliance with Governmental Regulations for more discussion on orders and regulatory initiatives impacting the oil and natural gas industry pursued under the Biden Administration. To the extent that our operations in federal waters are restricted, delayed for varying lengths of time or cancelled, such developments could have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations, our ability to replace reserves and the ability to implement our business strategy.\nWe may be unable to provide the financial assurances in the amounts and under the time periods required by the BOEM if the BOEM submits future demands to cover our decommissioning obligations. If in the future the BOEM issues orders to provide additional financial assurances and we fail to comply with such future orders, the BOEM could elect to take actions that would materially adversely impact our operations and our properties, including commencing proceedings to suspend our operations or cancel our federal offshore leases.\nThe BOEM requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to its regulations and provide acceptable financial assurances to assure satisfaction of lease obligations, including decommissioning activities on the OCS. As of the filing date of this Form 10-K, we are in compliance with our financial assurance obligations to the BOEM and have no outstanding BOEM orders, requests or financial assurance obligations. The BOEM under the Obama and Trump Administrations had sought to implement varying levels of stringent and costly standards under the existing federal financial assurance requirements, either through issuance and implementation of NTL #2016-N01 as was the case under the Obama Administration, or proposing rulemaking to revise the decommissioning and related financial assurance regulations as was the case under the Trump Administration. However, BOEM under the Biden Administration is expected to propose new financial assurance requirements that, if adopted as proposed, could increase our operating costs. See Part I, Item 1, Business - Compliance with Governmental Regulations for more discussion on financial assurance regulatory initiatives impacting the oil and natural gas industry that may be pursued under the Biden Administration. Additionally, the BOEM could in the future make new demands for additional financial assurances covering our obligations under our properties, which could exceed the Company\u2019s capabilities to provide. If we fail to comply with such future orders, the BOEM could commence enforcement proceedings or take other remedial action, including assessing civil penalties, suspending operations or production, or initiating procedures to cancel leases, which, if upheld, would have a material adverse effect on our business, properties, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be limited in our ability to maintain or recognize additional proved undeveloped reserves under current SEC guidance.\nSEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, PUD reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of initial booking. This requirement may limit our ability to book additional PUD reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our PUD reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required five-year timeframe.\nAdditional deepwater drilling laws, regulations and other restrictions, delays and other offshore-related developments in the Gulf of Mexico may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn January 2021, President Biden suspended new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands and waters, including the OCS pending review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas leasing and permitting practices. While this suspension was challenged and enjoined in June 2021 by a federal district court, the Biden Administration is appealing the court decision. Additionally, regulatory agencies under the Biden Administration may issue new or amended rulemakings regarding deep water leasing, permitting or drilling that could result in more stringent or costly restrictions, delays or cancellations to our operations as well as those of similarly situated offshore energy companies on the OCS. The BSEE and the BOEM have over the past decade, primarily under the Obama Administration, imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements with respect to new wells drilled in federal deepwater. While actions by BSEE or BOEM under the former Trump Administration sought to mitigate or delay certain of those more rigorous standards, the Biden Administration could reconsider rules and regulatory initiatives implemented under the Trump Administration and replace them with new, more stringent requirements and also provide more rigorous enforcement of existing regulatory requirements. Compliance with any added or more stringent Biden Administration regulatory requirements or enforcement initiatives and existing environmental and spill regulations, together with uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies and delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill response and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. Moreover, governmental agencies under the Biden Administration\nare expected to continue to evaluate aspects of safety and operational performance in the United States Gulf of Mexico that could result in new, more restrictive requirements.\nThese regulatory actions, or any new rules, regulations, or legal or enforcement initiatives or controls that impose increased costs or more stringent operational standards could delay or disrupt our operations, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs and limit activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities or result in the suspension or cancellation of leases. Also, if material spill incidents were to occur in the future, the United States could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws or regulations on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover some or all of the risks associated with such operations. See Part I, Item 1. Business - Compliance with Governmental Regulations for more discussion on orders and regulatory initiatives impacting the oil and natural gas industry that are being pursued under the Biden Administration.\nOur estimates of future ARO may vary significantly from period to period and are especially significant because our operations are concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico.\nWe are required to record a liability for the present value of our ARO to plug and abandon inactive non-producing wells, to remove inactive or damaged platforms, and inactive or damaged facilities and equipment, collectively referred to as \u201cidle iron,\u201d and to restore the land or seabed at the end of oil and natural gas production operations. An existing BSEE NTL describes the obligations of offshore operators to timely decommission idle iron by means of abandonment and removal. Pursuant to these idle iron NTL requirements, BSEE issued us letters, directing us to plug and abandon certain wells that the agency identified as no longer capable of production in paying quantities by specified timelines. In response, we are currently evaluating the list of wells proposed as idle iron by BSEE and currently anticipate that those wells determined to be idle iron will be decommissioned by the specified timelines or at times as otherwise determined by BSEE following further discussions with the agency. While we have established AROs for well decommissioning, additional AROs, significant in amount, may be necessary to conduct plugging and abandonment of the wells designated in the future as idle iron, but we do not expect the costs to plug and abandon such additional wells will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Nevertheless, these decommissioning activities are typically considerably more expensive for offshore operations as compared to most land-based operations due to increased regulatory scrutiny and the logistical issues associated with working in waters of various depths, and there exists the possibility that increased liabilities beyond what we established as AROs may arise and the pace for completing these activities could be adversely affected by idle iron decommissioning activities being pursued by other offshore oil and gas lessees that may also have received similar BSEE directives, which could restrict the availability of equipment and experienced workforce necessary to accomplish this work.\nMoreover, BSEE under the Biden Administration could also reconsider its current NTL on idle iron removal or existing idle iron-related regulations and establish new, more stringent decommissioning requirements on an expedited basis. Estimating future restoration and removal costs in the Gulf of Mexico is especially difficult because most of the removal obligations may be many years in the future, regulatory requirements are subject to change or such requirements may be interpreted more restrictively, and asset removal technologies are constantly evolving, which may result in additional or increased costs. As a result, we may make significant increases or decreases to our estimated ARO in future periods. For example, because we operate in the Gulf of Mexico, platforms, facilities and equipment are subject to damage or destruction as a result of hurricanes. The estimated cost to plug and abandon a well or dismantle a platform can change dramatically if the host platform, from which the work was anticipated to be performed, is damaged or toppled rather than structurally intact. Accordingly, our estimate of future ARO will differ dramatically from our recorded estimate if we have a damaged platform.\nAny additional requirements under BOEM\u2019s formerly issued NTL #2016-N01, if it were re-issued and fully implemented, or in the event BOEM under the Biden Administration were to issue new, more stringent financial assurance guidance or requirements, would increase our operating costs and reduce the availability of surety bonds due to the increased demands for such bonds in a low-price commodity environment. In addition, increased demand for salvage contractors and equipment could result in increased costs for decommissioning activities, including plugging and abandonment operations. These items have, and may further, increase our costs and impact our liquidity adversely.\nIn addition, the U.S. Government imposes strict joint and several liability under the OCSLA on the various lessees of a federal oil and gas lease for lease obligations, including decommissioning activities, which means that any single co-lessee may be liable to the U.S. Government for the full amount of all of the multiple lessees\u2019 obligations under the lease. In certain circumstances, we also could be liable for accrued decommissioning liabilities on federal oil and gas leases that we previously owned and assigned to an unrelated third party should the assignee to whom we assigned the leases or any future assignee of those leases is unable to perform its decommissioning obligations (including payment of costs incurred by unrelated parties in decommissioning such lease facilities). For example, we have in the past received a demand for payment of decommissioning costs related to accrued liabilities for property interests that were sold several years prior. These indirect obligations would affect our costs, operating profits and cash flows negatively and could be material.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration, development, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas and operational safety. Future laws or regulations, any adverse change in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with such legal requirements may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations could be significantly delayed or curtailed, and our cost of operations could significantly increase as a result of regulatory requirements or restrictions. Regulated matters include lease permit restrictions; limitations on our drilling activities in environmentally sensitive areas, such as marine habitats, and restrictions on the way we can discharge materials into the environment; bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well decommissioning costs; the spacing of wells; operational reporting; reporting of natural gas sales for resale; and taxation. Under these laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injuries; property and natural resource damages; well site reclamation costs; and governmental sanctions, such as fines and penalties.\nWe are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. It is also possible that a portion of our oil and natural gas properties could be subject to eminent domain proceedings or other government takings for which we may not be adequately compensated. See Business - Compliance with Government Regulations under Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-K for a more detailed explanation of regulations impacting our business.\nOur operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with environmental laws and regulations as well as legal requirements applicable to MPAs and endangered and threatened species.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations require the acquisition of a permit or other approval before drilling or other regulated activity commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit exploration or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, MPAs and other protected areas or that may affect certain wildlife, including marine species and endangered and threatened species; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties; loss of our leases; incurrence of investigatory, remedial or corrective obligations; and the imposition of injunctive relief, which could prohibit, limit or restrict our operations in a particular area.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general and on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could incur strict joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination, regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination\nand regardless of whether our operations met previous standards in the industry at the time they were conducted. Our permits require that we report any incidents that cause or could cause environmental damages.\nNew laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement could significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs or could result in delays, limitations or cancelations to our exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. See Business - Compliance with Environmental Regulations under Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-K for a more detailed description of our environmental, marine species, and endangered and threatened species regulations.\nThe threat of climate change could result in increased costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and foreign countries. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs as well as to eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations are subject to a series of regulatory, political and litigation and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Compliance with Environmental Regulations\u201d for more discussion on the threat of climate and restriction of GHG emissions. The adoption and implementation of any international, federal, regional or state legislation, executive actions, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions on our operations or in areas where we produce oil and natural gas could result in increased compliance costs or costs of consuming fossil fuels, and thereby reduce demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. Additionally, political, financial and litigation risks may result in us having to restrict, delay or cancel production activities, incur liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impair the ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Increasing attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential customer use of substitutes to energy commodities may result in increased costs, reduced demand for oil and natural gas we produce, resulting in reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Moreover, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar geothermal, tidal and biofuels) could reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues. Finally, increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other climatic events.\nIncreasing attention to Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters may impact our business.\nIncreasing attention to climate change, societal expectations for companies to address climate change, investor and societal expectations regarding voluntary ESG disclosures, and consumer demand for alternative forms of energy may result in increased costs, reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce, reduced profits, increased risks of governmental investigations and private party litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change and environmental conservation, for example, may result in demand shifts from oil and natural gas products and bias against companies operating in the sector. To the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to our causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.\nWe have established a managerial ESG Task Force composed of cross-functional management-level employees in Operations, HSE&R, Legal, Human Resources, Investor Relations, and Finance. This task force is responsible for overseeing and managing our ESG reporting initiatives and suggesting areas of focus to our executive management. Executive management in turn reports on those activities to the Board of Directors. Throughout 2021, we undertook several initiatives to improve our ESG performance. From an environmental perspective, we consolidated the gas processing operations for our Mobile Bay assets which lowered our greenhouse gas emissions related to the operation of those assets. On the social front, we instituted a company-wide diversity training program and tied completion of that program to our short-term compensation for the year. Relating to governance, we continued to assess\nthe various competing ESG frameworks; executive management and the Board are evaluating the appropriate oversight and management policies and procedures that would allow us to continue to strengthen our ESG performance. Our current ESG governance structure may not allow us to adequately identify or manage ESG related risks and opportunities, which may include failing to achieve ESG-related strategies and goals.\nOrganizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance, climate change, health and safety and other ESG related factors have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings and recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with fossil energy-related assets could lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us or our customers and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our unit price and/or our access to and costs of capital.", "PERMNO": 90533, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "WTI"}
