{"cik": "1094285", "company": "TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Factors; Cautionary Statement as to Forward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect Teledyne\u2019s financial condition and\noperations. You should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect\nTeledyne. Any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, competitive position or reputation, including materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings.\nRisks related to the pending acquisition of FLIR\nOn January 4, 2021, we announced our proposed acquisition of FLIR in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $8.0 billion (including net debt), which would make the acquisition our largest to date. FLIR designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes technologies that enhance perception and awareness. FLIR provides innovative sensing solutions through thermal imaging, visible-light imaging, video analytics, measurement and diagnostic, and advanced threat detection systems. FLIR offers a diversified portfolio that serves a number of applications in government and defense, industrial, and commercial markets. FLIR, headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon, will be part of the Digital Imaging segment.\nWhile many of the products made and markets served by FLIR are complementary to Teledyne, the acquisition of FLIR would expand the size of our Digital Imaging segment relative to our other segments. Continued innovation and research and development efforts will be required to maintain FLIR\u2019s leadership position in imaging products. There are numerous risk and uncertainties associated with the acquisition, including:\n\u2022Completion of the acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, some of which are outside of our control, and if any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the acquisition will not be completed. Among these conditions are the approval by FLIR\u2019s stockholders of the acquisition, the approval by our stockholders of the issuance of Teledyne stock in the acquisition and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act and under the antitrust laws of certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\u2022Teledyne\u2019s and FLIR\u2019s existing business relationships with third parties may be disrupted due to uncertainty associated with the acquisition, which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of the combined company.\n\u2022Failure to complete the acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.\n\u2022The merger agreement between Teledyne and FLIR subjects us to restrictions on our activities, such as certain equity issuances during the period while the acquisition is pending.\n\u2022After the acquisition, as a result of the issuance of Teledyne stock in the acquisition to the holders of FLIR stock, Teledyne stockholders will have lower ownership and voting interests in Teledyne than they currently have and will exercise less influence over management.\n\u2022Litigation challenging the acquisition may increase costs and prevent the acquisition from being completed within the expected timeframe, or from being completed at all.\n\u2022Both we and FLIR will incur significant transaction costs in connection with the acquisition.\n\u2022Unplanned future events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion to earnings that is currently projected by us in connection with the acquisition.\n\u2022Pursuant to the merger agreement we may be required, under certain circumstances related to the termination of the merger agreement, to pay a termination fee to FLIR of $250.0 million, which, if paid, may materially and adversely affect our financial results.\n\u2022We intend to pay the cash portion of the consideration for the acquisition, refinance certain existing indebtedness of us and FLIR, and pay other fees and expenses required to be paid in connection with the acquisition from cash on hand and borrowings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the funds necessary to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration in connection with the acquisition and refinance certain existing indebtedness on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic may delay or prevent the completion of the acquisition.\n\u2022After completion of the acquisition, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\n\u2022The future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following completion of the acquisition.\n\u2022Both Teledyne and FLIR may have difficulty retaining, motivating, and attracting executives and other employees in light of the pending acquisition, including those experienced with post-acquisition integration, and failure to do so could seriously harm the combined company.\n\u2022The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of Teledyne, FLIR and the combined company following the completion of the acquisition.\n\u2022The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition if, among other things, the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts, or if the effect of the acquisition on the combined company\u2019s financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.\nRisks related to the indebtedness expected to be incurred in connection with the FLIR acquisition\nThe incurrence by us of substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of the acquisition, along with the planned assumption of FLIR\u2019s existing senior notes may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nTeledyne expects to incur a significant amount of indebtedness in connection with the financing of the FLIR acquisition, which we expect will be funded using borrowings along with cash on hand. We may also incur additional indebtedness through the planned assumption of FLIR\u2019s existing senior notes. The use of indebtedness to finance the acquisition will reduce our liquidity and could cause us to place more reliance on cash generated from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for working capital and capital expenditure\nneeds or to pursue other potential strategic plans. We expect that the agreements we will enter into with respect to the indebtedness we will incur to finance the acquisition or in connection with the planned assumption of FLIR\u2019s existing senior notes will contain negative covenants, that, subject to certain exceptions, will include limitations on indebtedness, liens, dispositions, investments and mergers and other fundamental changes. Our ability to comply with these negative covenants can be affected by events beyond our control. The indebtedness and these negative covenants will also have the effect, among other things, of limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, limiting our flexibility in the conduct of our business and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions. In addition, a breach of the negative covenants could result in an event of default with respect to the indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nFollowing completion of the acquisition, the credit rating of the combined company could be downgraded and/or the combined company may fail to obtain an investment grade rating, which may increase borrowing costs or could trigger an obligation to make an offer to purchase FLIR\u2019s $500 million senior notes.\nBy reason of the debt incurred to finance the cash portion of the consideration for the acquisition, the combined company will have a considerably higher level of indebtedness than we and FLIR currently have in the aggregate, and there can be no assurance that the credit ratings of the existing FLIR debt will not be subject to a downgrade below investment grade. If a ratings downgrade were to occur or if the combined company fails to obtain an investment grade rating, the combined company could experience higher borrowing costs in the future and more restrictive debt covenants, which would reduce profitability and diminish operational flexibility. Specifically, in the event that FLIR\u2019s existing senior notes are downgraded below investment grade as a result of the acquisition, the terms of these notes will require the combined company to commence a change of control offer after the closing of the acquisition.\nBecause of higher debt levels, we may not be able to service our debt obligations in accordance with the terms contained in the agreements.\nOur ability to meet our expense and debt service obligations contained in the agreements we expect to enter into with respect to the indebtedness we will incur to finance the acquisition will depend on our available cash and its future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in laws or regulations, industry conditions, industry supply and demand balance, customer preferences, the success of our products and pressure from competitors. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations after the acquisition or should we fail to comply with our financial and other negative covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices, incur additional indebtedness or issue common stock or other equity securities. We may not be able to, at any given time, refinance our debt, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities on terms acceptable to us, in amounts sufficient to meet our needs. If we are able to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, such issuance would also result in dilution to our stockholders. Our inability to service our obligations or refinance our debt could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results after the acquisition. In addition, our debt obligations may limit our ability to make required investments in capacity, technology or other areas of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nAcquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy includes acquisitions. In 2020 and 2019, we expended $29.0 million and $484.0 million in cash, respectively, relating to acquisitions and other investments. Acquisitions involve various inherent risks, such as:\n\u2022our ability to assess accurately the value, strengths, weaknesses, internal controls, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, including the potential loss of key personnel from an acquired business, our potential inability to achieve identified financial, operating and other synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition, and integration issues associated with internal controls of acquired businesses;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing businesses;\n\u2022the potential impairment of assets;\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities associated with a business that we acquire or in which we invest, including environmental liabilities; and\n\u2022production delays associated with consolidating acquired facilities and manufacturing operations.\nWhile we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection, such as indemnification from the seller, insurance coverage, and sometimes placing a portion of the purchase price in escrow to cover potential liabilities, such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition. Further, indemnities, insurance or escrow arrangements may not fully cover such matters.\nIn connection with our acquisitions, including those acquisitions that we do not complete, we may incur significant transaction costs. We are required to expense, as incurred, such transaction costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur indebtedness, and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness, could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs of January 3, 2021, we had $778.5 million total outstanding indebtedness, including $195.0 million in senior unsecured fixed rate notes, $305.3 million in Euro denominated fixed rate notes, $150.0 million in term loans and $125.0 million outstanding under our $750.0 million floating rate credit facility. Our indebtedness or a failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could harm our business by, among other things, reducing the funds available to make acquisitions, capital expenditures, or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions. Our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. Our indebtedness or a failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business. General adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner.\nFurther, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR) has announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in debt instruments, derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives, debt and cash markets exposed to USD-LIBOR. It is unclear as to what the new method of calculating LIBOR that may evolve and this new method could adversely affect the Company\u2019s interest rates on the Company\u2019s indebtedness. The Company is monitoring the ARRC transition plan and is evaluating potential related risks. As of January 3, 2021, approximately 35.3% of the Company\u2019s long-term debt is variable and can be indexed to USD-LIBOR. Our $750.0 million credit facility includes a procedure to switch to LIBOR alternative replacement rates in the future.\nEscalating global trade tensions and the adoption or expansion of tariffs and trade restrictions could negatively impact us.\nThe Company has operations in China, which represented one of the top five countries for our international sales in 2020 and 2019. Any tariffs or other trade restrictions affecting the import of products from China or any retaliatory trade measures taken by China in response to existing or future tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nStarting in 2018, the U.S. Government imposed tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from China and China has retaliated by placing tariffs on various U.S. origin goods. While both countries signed a preliminary trade agreement in January 2020 halting further tariffs and increasing sales of U.S. goods to China, the agreement leaves in place most tariffs on Chinese goods. The final outcome of the negotiations and agreements is not possible to predict. Further escalation of the \u201ctrade war\u201d between the U.S. and China, or the countries\u2019 inability to reach further trade agreements, could result in continued or increased tariffs. High tariffs generally increase the cost of materials for our products, which could result in our products becoming less competitive or generating lower margins. With high tariffs imposed on our products, we may also need to find new suppliers and components for our products, which could result in production delays. To the extent our products are the subject of retaliatory tariffs, customers in some countries or regions, such as China, may begin to seek domestic or non-U.S. sources for products that we sell, or be pressured or incentivized by foreign governments not to purchase U.S.-origin goods, which could harm our future sales in these markets. Additionally, if China bolsters laws or regulations requiring the use of local China suppliers, it could have a negative impact on Teledyne\u2019s revenues.\nAdditionally, a number of well-established customers and suppliers have become listed on Government restricted party lists without much warning. In particular, U.S. export enforcement agencies have placed several Chinese and Russian companies and many of their international subsidiaries on such lists, prohibiting the export of most commercial and dual-use items subject to the Export Administration Regulations. Multiple Teledyne companies had large pending orders with some of those companies that had to be either cancelled or for which Teledyne has submitted export license applications that have a low probability of approval. For example, Huawei Technologies, Co., Ltd. (\u201cHuawei\u201d), and its non-U.S. affiliates have been added to the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security Entity list. Huawei was a customer of our test and measurement business, and pending export license applications have not yet been approved. The U.S. Government has also made efforts to increase restrictions on some of the listed entities, including proposals to expand U.S. export jurisdiction over foreign made products containing certain U.S.-origin materials. In 2020, the U.S. Government applied restrictions to products sold to Huawei where there was no U.S. content in the products, but certain equipment used to manufacture the products had U.S. origins. Additionally, we face the risk that Airbus, a customer to our commercial aerospace business, will demonstrate a preference for non-U.S. sources due to the complications and uncertainties of trade compliance. While we will continue to work to mitigate the impact of tariffs and trade restrictions, they could result in revenue reduction, price increases on material\nused in our products or production delays, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operational results and cash flows.\nA material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in the oil and gas industry, especially the offshore oil and gas industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices.\nA material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in or connected to oil and gas exploration, development and production, especially the offshore oil and gas industry. The oil and gas industry has historically been cyclical and characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities. Oil and gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in those prices, significantly affect the levels of those activities. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and the results of our businesses within our Instrumentation segment.\nSome factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our products and services include the following:\n\u2022worldwide demand for oil and gas;\n\u2022general economic and business conditions and industry trends;\n\u2022the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d), to set and maintain production levels;\n\u2022the level of production by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022the ability of oil and gas companies to generate or raise funds for capital expenditures;\n\u2022domestic and foreign tax policy;\n\u2022laws and governmental regulations that restrict exploration and development of oil and gas in various offshore jurisdictions;\n\u2022laws and governmental regulation that restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022technological changes;\n\u2022the political environment of oil-producing regions;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022climate change regulations that provide incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources.\nTeledyne manufactures seismic energy sources, interconnects and data acquisition products that are used in offshore energy exploration. When crude oil and natural gas prices are low, the level of marine seismic exploration activity typically decreases, potentially resulting in reduced demand for our products used in offshore energy exploration. In addition, a decline in the level of capital spending by oil and natural gas companies may result in a reduced rate of development of new energy reserves, which could adversely affect demand for our products related to energy production, and, in certain instances, result in the cancellation, modification or rescheduling of existing orders and a reduction in customer-funded research and development related to next generation products.\nRecession, financial and credit market disruptions, or an economic downturn in China, may adversely affect us.\nIf another global recession emerges, if economic uncertainty in Europe continues or worsens, or if economic growth in China slows, we may experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash flows from reduced orders, payment delays, collection difficulties, increased price pressures for our products, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories or other factors caused by the economic problems of our customers. Our sales to China-based customers represented approximately 6.0% and 6.6% of total revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Economic growth in China had slowed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued growth in many of our businesses, including those in our Environmental Instrumentation group, could be negatively impacted if another economic downturn occurs in China. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets. If negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers from having access to credit or render them insolvent, orders for our products may decrease, which would result in lower revenue. Likewise, if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products, or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent, they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products. An economic or credit crisis could also impact our ability to raise capital when needed. These events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue, increased price competition, and increased operating costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operational results, and cash flows.\nWe develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets, domestic and international commercial aerospace markets, the semiconductor industry, and the consumer electronics, telecommunications and automotive industries; each of which has been cyclical, exhibited rapid changes and suffered from fluctuating market demands. A cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results. Due to declines in air travel, we face risk that our addressable market for retrofit products will shrink further as airlines retire significant number of aircraft.\nIn addition, we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and to customers in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity constraints. Adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services, which may reduce our revenues, profits or production levels. Some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical\nrefining, which may be negatively impacted in the event of future reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with international sales and international operations, which could harm our business or results of operations.\nDuring 2020, sales to international customers accounted for approximately 45% of our total revenues, compared with 44% in 2019. In 2020, we sold products to customers in over 100 countries. In 2020, the top five countries for international sales were China, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and France, constituting approximately 20% of our total sales. We anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues, particularly since business and growth plans for many Teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the United States to emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil and West Africa.\nRisks associated with international sales and operations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022political and economic instability;\n\u2022international terrorism;\n\u2022export controls, including U.S. export controls related to China, sanctions related to Russia, and increased scrutiny of exports of marine instruments, digital imaging and other products;\n\u2022failure to comply with anti-bribery legislation, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022changes in legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022U.S. and foreign government policy changes affecting the markets for our products;\n\u2022changes in tax laws and tariffs;\n\u2022changes in U.S. - China and U.S. - Russia relations;\n\u2022difficulties in protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022failure to comply with the foreign data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in the European Union;\n\u2022inadvertent transfers of export-controlled information due to increased cross-border technology transfers and the use of offshore computer servers;\n\u2022transportation, including piracy in international waters;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022challenges relating to managing a global workforce with diverse cultures and backgrounds.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Exchange rate fluctuations may increase the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position.\nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d The U.K. formally left the E.U. on January 31, 2020 and entered a transition period until December 31, 2020 during which the U.K. remained in both the E.U. customs union and single market. That transition period has now ended and the E.U. and U.K. have entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement (\u201cTCA\u201d). The TCA ensures tariff-free and quota-free trade in goods between the E.U and the U.K. but also introduces certain non-tariff barriers to trade. In the medium- to long-term, the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. may create further global economic uncertainty, which may adversely impact the economies of the U.K., the E.U. countries and other nations, may cause our current and future customers to reduce their spending on our products and services, and may cause certain E.U.-based customers to source products from businesses based outside of the U.K. For example, Brexit-related uncertainty could lead to a reconsideration by Airbus as to future investment and spending in the U.K., which could reduce sales for our U.K.-based businesses that supply Airbus. Potential Brexit-related risks for our U.K.-based businesses also include increased import duties, loss of customers in the E.U., delays in the movement of goods between the U.K. and the E.U. and loss of access to the E.U. labor pool. Given our several U.K.-based businesses, volatility in the value of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar, or other foreign currencies, could increase the cost of raw materials and components for our U.K.-based businesses and could otherwise adversely affect the business, operations and the financial condition of our U.K.-based businesses.\nHigher tax rates may harm our results of operations and cash flow.\nAs Teledyne expands globally, increases in the United States of the taxation of foreign income and expenses may harm our results of operations and cash flow. The relative amount of income we earn in other jurisdictions could reduce our net income and increase our cash payments. Additionally, the new U.S. Presidential administration proposed a higher corporate tax rate of 28% compared to 21%. Such increased tax rate in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions could also reduce our net income and increase our cash payments.\nChanges in future business conditions could cause business investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to become impaired, resulting in significant losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income.\nOn January 3, 2021, Teledyne\u2019s goodwill was $2,150.0 million and net acquired intangible assets were $409.7 million. Under current accounting guidance, we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach, rather than amortizing the value over time. We have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We are also required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in an entity\u2019s market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors. If the fair market value is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, we could be required to record an impairment charge. The valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows, discount rates and estimated product life cycles. In making these judgments, we evaluate the financial health of the business, including such factors as industry performance, changes in technology and operating cash flows. As we have grown through acquisitions, the amount of goodwill and net acquired intangible assets is a significant portion of our total assets. As a result, the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken. We also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if, as a result of a change in strategy or other reason, we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired.\nFor additional discussion of business investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets, see the discussion under \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur revenue from U.S. Government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the U.S. Government, and, accordingly, we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed or that funding for new programs will not be available.\nWe perform work on a number of contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and other agencies and departments of the U.S. Government including subcontracts with government prime contractors. Sales under contracts with the U.S. Government, including sales under contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, as prime contractor or subcontractor, represented approximately 26% of our total revenue in 2020, compared with 24% in 2019. Performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nGovernment contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations and the failure of Congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations. U.S. Government shutdowns have resulted in delays in anticipated contract awards and delayed payments of invoices for several of our businesses and any new shutdown could have similar or worse effects. The failure by Congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our products and services and cause us to lose future revenues. Any renewed emphasis on Federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a further decrease in overall defense spending. Budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors, and smaller defense budgets could result in government in-sourcing of programs and more intense competition on programs that are not in-sourced, which could result in lower revenues and profits.\nAlso, defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us, because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding. Changes in policy and budget priorities by the new U.S. Presidential Administration for various defense and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (\u201cNASA\u201d) programs could impact our Engineered Systems, Aerospace and Defense Electronics and Digital Imaging segments. Our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment may be impacted by volume or price reductions in connection with the Joint Strike Fighter program, to the extent they are imposed. The timing of program cycles can affect our results of operations for a quarter or year, and cancellations of significant programs such as the Space Launch System (\u201cSLS\u201d), Launch Vehicle Stage Adapter (\u201cLVSA\u201d), International Space Station (\u201cISS\u201d), Mission Operations and Integration (\u201cMO&I\u201d), or the Shallow Water Combat Submersible (\u201cSWCS\u201d) would affect our results.\nIn 2020 and 2019, our largest contract with the U.S. Government was the MO&I contract, which represented 1.5% and 1.4% of our total net sales, respectively. In June 2020, Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. was notified that NASA had awarded to another contractor the Marshall Operations, Systems, Services, and Integration (\u201cMOSSI\u201d) contract, which represented a combination of the Huntsville Operations Support Center contract and the MO&I contract. Subsequently, Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. filed a protest challenging such award, which protest was sustained and which sustainment triggered the cancelation of the MOSSI request for proposal and requiring a new acquisition, free of involvement of individuals with a conflict of interest, to begin. While the MO&I contract continues through September 2021, and NASA has several options to further extend it through March 2023, there is no guarantee it will be further extended. NASA anticipates release of the new acquisition, the Marshall Operations, Systems, Services, and Integration II, draft solicitation in April 2021 with the award expected in late 2022. There is no guarantee that Teledyne Brown Engineering will be awarded this new contract.\nIt is also not uncommon for the U.S. Department of Defense to delay the timing of awards or change orders for major programs for six to twelve months. Reductions and delays in research and development funding by the U.S. Government could impact our revenues. Uncertainty over budgets or priorities with the new U.S. Presidential Administration could result in delays in funding and the timing of awards, and changes in funded programs that could have a material impact on our revenues. A significant shift in U.S. Government priorities related to programs and acquisition strategies could have a material impact to our financial results.\nFurther, most of our U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the U.S. Government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor. Termination for convenience provisions provides only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses, and profit on work completed prior to termination. Termination for default clauses imposes liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in re-procuring undelivered items from another source. We had no U.S. Government contracts terminated for convenience in 2020, compared with three in 2019. No contracts were terminated for default during such two-year period.\nOur U.S. Government contracting business is subject to government contracting regulations, including increasingly complex regulations on cybersecurity, and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects.\nOur U.S. Government contracting businesses, like other government contractors, are subject to various audits, reviews and investigations (including private party \u201cwhistleblower\u201d lawsuits) relating to our compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. More routinely, the U.S. Government may audit the costs we incur on our U.S. Government contracts, including allocated indirect costs. Such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed would need to be refunded. We have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize after final audit. In a worst case scenario, should a business or division be charged with wrongdoing, or should the U.S. Government determine that the business or division is not a \u201cpresently responsible contractor,\u201d that business or division, and conceivably our Company as a whole, could be temporarily suspended or, in the event of a conviction, could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or government-approved subcontracts. In addition, we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages, fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements. Routine audits by U.S. Government agencies of Teledyne\u2019s various procurement and accounting systems have the potential to result in disapproval of the audited systems by the administrative contracting officer. Disapproval could significantly impact cash flow, as up to 10% may be withheld from payments.\nThe Department of Defense as well as other U.S. Government contracting agencies have adopted rules and regulations requiring contractors to implement a set of cyber security measures to attain the safeguarding of contractor systems that process, store, or transmit certain information. Implementation and compliance with these cyber security requirements is complex and costly, and could result in unforeseen expenses, lower profitability and, in the case of non-compliance, penalties and damages, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business. The cyber security requirements also impact our supply base which could impact cost, schedule and performance on programs if suppliers do not meet the requirements and therefore, do not qualify to support the programs.\nWe may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities. Our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving existing products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields. Our Teledyne Scientific Company subsidiary, which serves as our primary research center, has been actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other Teledyne businesses, including Teledyne Oil & Gas, Teledyne Defense Electronics, Teledyne Digital Imaging and our Test and Measurement businesses. The business of Teledyne e2v, for which the design and development of specialized technology for high performance systems and equipment is integral, also requires substantial investments in research and development. Additionally, some of our businesses have sought or are actively pursuing governmental support and funding for some of their research and development initiatives, including funding in 2019 for DALSA\u2019s semiconductor foundry in Bromont, Quebec. Nonetheless, we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible strategic acquisitions of businesses or product lines. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors, some of which will not be within our control, including the existence of bank and capital markets, investor perceptions of us, our businesses and the industries in which we operate, and general economic conditions. Failure to successfully raise needed capital or generate cash flow on a timely or cost-effective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability.\nLimitations in customer funding for applied research and development and limitations in government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas.\nWe may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner or increase our participation in new markets, which could harm our profitability and prospects.\nOur operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. We have major development activities at some of our businesses, for which a failure to execute in a timely manner could negatively impact those businesses. In order to improve our product development capabilities, we purchased the research center that is now Teledyne Scientific Company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased DALSA to gain access to a well-equipped MEMS research and development center. In 2013, we opened a 52,000-square-foot technology development center in Daytona Beach, Florida primarily to serve the offshore oil and gas production and exploration industries. We are currently upgrading infrastructure at Teledyne e2v\u2019s facility in Chelmsford, U.K. and have expanded Teledyne DALSA\u2019s MEMS foundry in Bromont, Quebec, as well as acquired a second MEMS foundry in Edmonton, Alberta as part of the Micralyne acquisition. Successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors, including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements, changes in technology and industry standards, our ability to differentiate our product offerings from the product offerings of our competitors, and market acceptance. We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements.\nWe also have the risk that our defense businesses may not be able to replace revenue related to legacy platforms with products for new platform applications. We face the risk that changes in systems architectures will obviate the need for our products. For example, electronically steered radar arrays do not need certain high voltage interconnects like mechanically steered radar arrays do and unmanned aircraft will not need ejection seat sequencers.\nOur new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes. We may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner.\nAdditionally, new products may trigger increased warranty costs as information on such products is augmented by actual usage. Accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed.\nWe intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments. We may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers\u2019 requirements, as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors.\nWe may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers\u2019 cost reduction mandates, which could harm our sales or margins.\nCost conscious customers may seek price reductions of our products. While we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products, without affecting product quality and reliability, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or to do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers. Prices of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market conditions. As a result, customers may seek lower cost products from China or other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower.\nThe airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) and equivalent regulatory agencies have increasingly focused on the need to assure that airline industry products are designed with sufficient cybersecurity controls to protect against unauthorized access or other unwanted compromise. A failure to meet these evolving expectations could negatively impact sales into the industry and expose us to legal or contractual liability.\nGovernmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. If any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then sale of the product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which often are more stringent than existing regulations. If such proposals are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Recent trends by China\u2019s aviation authority to relax restrictions on airspace may be reversed, and anticipated new regulations loosening airspace restrictions may not materialize, which could impact sales prospects in China for our commercial aerospace businesses.\nThe FAA and the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Fraud Section, among other agencies and countries, have been investigating two Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft crashes that occurred in October 2018 and March 2019, which resulted in the groundings of such aircraft across the world. Subsequently, Boeing announced in December 2019 that it was temporarily suspending production of the 737 Max starting in January 2020. While Boeing has started to resume minimal production in May 2020 and governmental groundings have been lifted, production is not expected to reach historic levels for the immediate future. While resumption of some production of the 737 Max has been factored into our business plans, there is a risk that airlines and air travelers may respond negatively to the 737 Max aircraft due to historic and continuing perceived safety concerns. These factors may further negatively impact our Teledyne Controls\u2019 business.\nIncreasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services.\nEach of our markets is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have, and potential competitors could have, greater name recognition, a larger installed base of products, more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial, technological and personnel resources. New or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services. We have been experiencing increased competition for some of our key products. Furthermore, some of our patents have or are expiring, which could open up further competition. For example, our U.S. patent related to our Wireless GroundLink product expired in 2018, allowing several competitors to enter the market. Additionally, some of our customers have been developing competing products or electing to vertically integrate and replace our products with their own. For example, Airbus is providing a wireless product, FOMAX, which now competes directly with Teledyne Controls hardware and services. Furthermore, Boeing has announced a vertical integration program, which includes avionics. Specifically, Boeing has expressed its intention to replace certain Teledyne wireless products on both the 737 Max and 787 aircraft with its own wireless products. Lastly, some of our products face increasing competition from alternative technologies. For example, the lead acid batteries that Teledyne Battery Products sells face competition from lithium ion batteries, among other competing technologies. The hydrogen generation systems that Teledyne Energy Systems sells also face increasing competition from new entrants to the on-site electrolysis of water market.\nIndustry acquisition and consolidation trends, particularly among aerospace and defense contractors, have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors elect to in-source major acquisition programs and expand small business participation to meet Government contracting goals. Such consolidations can also cause delays in business as the newly consolidated organization undergoes integration.\nLow-cost competition from China and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products. Increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge, which would negatively impact our revenues. Smaller defense budgets both in the United States and Europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs.\nProduct liability claims, product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products, including monitoring instruments, products used in offshore oil and gas production, products used in transportation and commercial aviation and products used in medical devices (including X-Ray detectors), our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products. In part, product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a product, which could adversely affect our results of operations. This could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven to be untrue or settled for immaterial amounts.\nWhile we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities and errors and omissions, we have self-insured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities. Awarded damages could be more than our accruals. We could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well. We cannot ensure that, for 2021 and in future years, insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability.\nProduct recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products. We cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any products.\nWe have been joined, among a number of defendants (often over 100), in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos. In addition, because of the prominent \u201cTeledyne\u201d name, we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spin-off. To date, we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits. However, our historic insurance coverage, including that of our predecessors, may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters. Coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors. Nonetheless, we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims.\nTeledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. and other Teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market, including utilities and certain governmental entities. Certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act and other statutory and common law defenses, and we have received indemnities from some of our customers. However, there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers, and subcontractors.\nSome items we purchase for the manufacture of our products are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability, price and other factors. For example, Teledyne Digital Imaging has an internal single source of supply for CCD semiconductor wafers used to assemble image sensors and an external single source of supply for CMOS semiconductor wafers used to assemble X-ray panel products. Furthermore, sole source supply is more common among our businesses that are heavily involved in research and development because there can be few suppliers in the world capable of producing the products or providing the services with the right highly specialized technology. Teledyne LeCroy continues to outsource a portion of its research and development activities to third-party engineering firms in Malaysia and India where it may be more difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights. We have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts, components, subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources, including international sources. Disruption of these sources or supplier-imposed rationing of scarce components could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations. We could experience global supply chain disruptions if the COVID-19 pandemic health crisis continues and new strains of the virus emerge. International sources possess additional risks, some of which are similar to those described above regarding international sales. With any continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets, some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit and materials to maintain their businesses, which could reduce the availability of some components and, to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products. Some companies engage subcontractors to perform a portion of the services we provide to our customers. To provide these services, the subcontractor must be financially viable, company with applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. Non-performance by a subcontractor could result in misalignment between subcontractor performance and our contractual obligations to our customers. Lastly, our Teledyne Hi-Rel business screens, tests, packages, performs various services and resells products of a third party, and faces the risk that such third party may end its relationship due to economic conditions and other factors.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties which could harm our business.\nWe sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers and OEMs (collectively, \u201cdistributors\u201d). Using third parties for distribution exposes Teledyne to many risks, including concentration, credit risk and legal risk because under certain circumstances we may be held responsible for the actions of those third-party sales channels. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) or similar anti-bribery laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Competitors could also block our access to key distributors. Failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position, and could result in sanctions against us.\nCompliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations, as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities, could have a material adverse financial effect on us.\nWe, like other industry participants, are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations. We may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase. Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing and the use of seismic energy sources for offshore energy exploration could adversely affect some product lines of our Instrumentation segment.\nOur manufacturing operations, including former operations, could expose us to material environmental liabilities. Additionally, companies that we acquire may have environmental liabilities that might not be accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) has focused on greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d), maintaining GHGs threaten the public health and welfare of the American people. The EPA also maintains that GHG emissions from on-road vehicles contribute to that threat. The EPA\u2019s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases. The EPA\u2019s continuing efforts to limit GHG emissions could adversely affect our U.S. manufacturing operations, increase prices for energy, fuel and transportation, require us to accommodate changes in parameters, such as the way parts are manufactured, and may, in some cases, require us to redesign certain of our products. This, or other federal or state regulations, could lead to increased costs, which we may not be able to recover from customers, delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors. For example, Teledyne Battery Products unit makes lead acid batteries in California and is subject to a variety of environmental regulations and inspections, which have increased over time. Also, some of our sites conduct electroplating, metal finishing and other operations that utilize hazardous materials that are subject to similar regulations. Regulatory changes or failure to meet applicable requirements could disrupt that business or force a closure or relocation of the business.\nOur products are subject to various regulations that prohibit or restrict the use of certain hazardous substances. For example, our products placed on the European market are subject to the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d) and the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment\n(\u201cROHS\u201d) Directives. Future hazardous substance restrictions or prohibitions may limit our ability to market some products in certain countries.\nFor additional discussion of environmental matters, see the discussion under the caption \u201cOther Matters - Environmental\u201d of \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operation and Financial Condition\u201d and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of our products that contribute to the environment, sustainability and climate science, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Environment and Sustainability.\u201d\nOur inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success.\nOur future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We also have a maturing workforce. Some of our businesses, including our businesses in traveling wave tube and integrated microwave module design and development, draw from a pool of specialized engineering talent that is small and currently shrinking. Some of our businesses have a need for employees with a certain level of security clearance, and competition for such employees has increased. While we have engaged in succession planning, the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to sell or reconfigure businesses, facilities or product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy or that should be consolidated.\nConsistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets, we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy and objectives. Over the years we have also consolidated some of our business units and facilities, in some cases to respond to downturns in the defense or oil and gas industries, among other reasons. During 2020, we relocated our Teledyne Paradise Datacom operation in State College, Pennsylvania to our Teledyne Microwave Solutions facility in Rancho Cordova, California. We may not be able to realize efficiencies and cost savings from our consolidation activities. There is no assurance that our efforts will be successful. If we do not successfully manage our current consolidation activities, or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Our ability to dispose of, exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors, including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement or lease agreement, as well as industry, business and economic conditions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell non-strategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, if the sale of any non-strategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical, alternative courses of action, including relocation of product lines or closure, may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated.\nNatural and man-made disasters could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSeveral of our facilities, as a result of their locations, could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, floods, ice storms or other natural disasters. Many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in California and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage due to wildfire. In November 2018, wildfires impacted areas near our headquarters and principal research and development center in Thousand Oaks, California, resulting in temporary disruptions and evacuations of employees who lived nearby. Local utilities may impose blackouts during high fire risk weather conditions, which could result in disruptions to our businesses located in California, including our headquarters. In the event of a major earthquake, tornado, hurricane or catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, vandalism, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or health epidemic (including COVID-19), we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our application development, lengthy interruptions in our products, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, all of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Teledyne DALSA\u2019s semiconductor facilities in Quebec, Canada have been impacted by loss of electrical power caused by severe ice storms. In addition, we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern United States and Texas that have been threatened or struck by major hurricanes. In 2017, our businesses located in Houston, Texas were impacted by Hurricane Harvey and our business in Florida was threatened by Hurricanes Irma and Matthew. Our facilities in Alabama, Florida, Nebraska, Tennessee and Virginia have also been threatened by tornados. If any of our California facilities, including our California headquarters, were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our Alabama, Florida, Nebraska, Tennessee or Texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane, storm, tornado or other natural disaster, or if DALSA\u2019s facilities in Quebec experience long-term loss of electrical power, such event could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities. In addition, the insurance we maintain may be insufficient to cover our losses resulting from disasters, cyber-attacks or other business interruptions, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased costs of, such insurance. In addition, our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans (including those relating to our information technology systems) may not be fully responsive to, or minimize losses associated with, catastrophic events.\nDisasters also have an indirect adverse impact on our business. For example, in 2018, a fire at a Netherlands-based facility of a key supplier of printed circuit boards resulted in delivery disruptions to the electronics industry, including to businesses in our Digital Imaging segment.\nTeledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. has developed, built, and launched a multiuser system for earth sensing that is affixed to the International Space Station (\u201cISS\u201d). For the program to continue to be financially successful, the 21-year-old ISS must continue to fly in a safe and human tended condition. While certain spaceflight risks, such as a high-velocity debris impact to the station causing significant structural damage or necessitating the evacuation of the ISS, have been regarded as small, if such event were to occur, the ISS program continuation could be threatened, jeopardizing our investment and potential revenue generation from ISS-based Earth imaging.\nWe may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, or third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual rights, each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business.\nOur ability to enforce and protect our patents, copyrights, software licenses, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we have found that various claims may be asserted against us, including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid, is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim. In addition, we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties. If we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation, we may not be able to sell a product or family of products due to an injunction, or we may have to pay damages that could, in turn, harm our results of operations. Our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches.\nAttempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage, crime, activism, or other motivations, include covertly introducing malware into our computers and computer networks, performing reconnaissance, impersonating authorized users, extortion, and stealing, corrupting or restricting our access to data, among other activities. We continue to train our personnel and update our infrastructure, security tools and processes to protect against security incidents, including both external and internal threats, and to prevent their recurrence. Company personnel and third parties have been tasked to detect, respond to, and investigate such incidents, but it is possible that we might not prevent or be aware of or be able to react to an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, corruption, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. We are subject to U.S. Department of Defense regulations applicable to certain types of data residing on or transiting through our information systems, and these regulations have been and will continue to be incorporated into certain U.S. Department of Defense contracts that we hold. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or controlled information of employees, third parties or the U.S. Government, or any of the deployed security controls are deemed insufficient, we may incur liability or the loss of contracts or security clearances. As a result, we expect to continue to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems. More resources may be required in the defense arena to the extent the U.S. Government increases its cyber security mandates. Unauthorized access to or control of our products, devices or systems could impact the safety of our customers and other third parties which could result in legal claims against us. Security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, including GDPR, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, and California Consumer Privacy Act and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Lastly, we are not immune from cyber security and privacy breaches of our customers and suppliers.\nProvisions of our governing documents, applicable law, and our Change in Control Severance Agreements could make an acquisition of Teledyne more difficult.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware contain several provisions, such as our classified Board, that could make the acquisition of control of Teledyne, in a transaction not approved by our Board, more difficult. We have also entered into Change in Control Severance Agreements with ten members of our current management, which could have an anti-takeover effect. These provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our Company.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d) designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain lawsuits between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a judicial forum that it finds favorable for such lawsuits and make it more costly for our stockholders to bring such lawsuits, which may have the effect of discouraging such lawsuits.\nOur Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or (v) action asserting a claim\ngoverned by the internal affairs doctrine. Our Bylaws also provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to this forum selection provision.\nHowever, this forum selection provision is not intended to apply to any actions brought under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\"), as amended, or the Exchange Act. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, the forum selection provision in our Bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nNevertheless, this forum selection provision in our Bylaws may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers and other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. While we believe the risk of a court declining to enforce the forum selection provision contained in our Bylaws is low, if a court were to find the provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nAn investment in Teledyne\u2019s Common Stock and other securities involve risks, many of which are beyond our control.\nStock markets in general, including the New York Stock Exchange on which our Common Stock is listed, have experienced a high degree of price and volume fluctuations that are not necessarily related to operating performance of the listed companies. In addition to general economic, political and market conditions, such volatility may be related to: (i) changes from analysts\u2019 expectations in revenues, earnings and other financial results; (ii) strategic actions by other competitors; (iii) changes to budgets or policies of the U.S. and other governments; and (iv) other risks described in this report. We cannot provide assurances as to our Common Stock price, which during fiscal 2020 has ranged from a low of $195.34 to a high of $398.99.", "PERMNO": 87445, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "TDY"}
