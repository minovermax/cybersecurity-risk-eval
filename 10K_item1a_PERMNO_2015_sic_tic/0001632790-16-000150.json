{"cik": "1632790", "company": "ENERGIZER HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-11-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this filing in evaluating Energizer and Energizer common stock. Any of the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face risks associated with global economic conditions.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions and uncertainty about future economic prospects could reduce consumer demand for our products. This could occur as a result of a reduction in discretionary spending or a shift of purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private label brands sold by retail chains or price brands. This shift could drive the market towards lower margin products or force us to reduce prices for our products in order to compete. Similarly, our retailer customers could reduce their inventories, shift to different products or require us to lower our prices to retain the shelf placement of our products. Declining financial performance by certain of our retailer customers could impact their ability to pay us on a timely basis, or at all. Worsening economic conditions could harm our sales and profitability. Additionally, disruptions in financial markets could reduce our access to debt and equity capital markets, negatively affecting our ability to implement our business strategy.\nCompetition in our industries may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, achieve profitability, or maintain relationships with existing customers.\nThe categories in which we operate are mature and highly competitive, both in the United States and globally, as a limited number of large manufacturers compete for consumer acceptance, limited retail shelf space and e-commerce opportunities. Because of the highly competitive environment in which we operate, as well as increasing retailer concentration, our retailer customers, including online retailers, frequently seek to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms, resulting in either reduction of our margins or losses of distribution to lower-cost competitors.\nCompetition is based upon brand perceptions, innovation, product performance, customer service and price. Our ability to compete effectively may be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources and greater market share in certain segments than we do, which could provide them with greater scale and negotiating leverage with retailers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nour competitors may have lower production, sales and distribution costs, and higher profit margins, which may enable them to offer aggressive retail discounts and other promotional incentives;\n\u2022\nour competitors have obtained, and may in the future be able to obtain, exclusivity or sole source at particular retailers or favorable in-store placement; and\n\u2022\nwe may lose market share to certain retailers, including club stores, grocery, dollar stores, mass merchandisers and internet-based retailers, which may offer \u201cprivate label\u201d brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the Company\u2019s products in certain categories.\nLoss of reputation of our leading brands or failure of our marketing plans could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on the continuing reputation and success of our brands, particularly our Energizer and Eveready brands. Our operating results could be adversely affected if any of our leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. Any damage to the Energizer and Eveready brands could impair our ability to charge premium prices for our products, resulting in the reduction of our margins or losses of distribution to lower price competitors.\nThe success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or new product offerings do not improve, or have a negative impact on, our brands\u2019 image or ability to attract and retain consumers. Additionally, if claims made in our marketing campaigns become subject to litigation alleging false advertising, which is common in our industry, it could damage our brand, cause us to alter our marketing plans in ways that may materially and adversely affect sales, or result in the imposition of significant damages against us. Further, a boycott or other campaign critical of us, through social media or otherwise, could negatively impact our brands\u2019 reputation and consequently our products\u2019 sales.\nLoss of any of our principal customers could significantly decrease our sales and profitability.\nGenerally, sales to our top customers are made pursuant to purchase orders and we do not have guarantees of minimum purchases from them. As a result, these customers may cancel their purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us at any time. The loss or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by any of our top customers would harm our sales and profitability. Additionally, increasing retailer customer concentration could result in reduced sales outlets for our products, as well as greater negotiating pressures and pricing requirements on us.\nSales of our battery products may be impacted by further changes in technology and device trends, which could impair our operating results and growth prospects.\nWe believe an increasing number of devices are using built-in battery systems, particularly in developed markets, leading to a declining volume trend in the battery category, which we expect will continue. This has and will likely continue to have a negative impact on the demand for primary batteries. This trend has and will continue to put additional pressure on results going forward, both directly through reduced consumption and indirectly as manufacturers aggressively price and promote their products to seek to retain market share or gain battery shelf space. Development and commercialization of new battery or device technologies not available to us could also negatively impact our results and prospects.\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations, including currency fluctuations, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is currently conducted on a worldwide basis, with approximately half of our sales in fiscal year 2016 arising from foreign countries, and a significant portion of our production capacity and cash located overseas. Consequently, we are subject to a number of risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022\nthe possibility of expropriation, confiscatory taxation or price controls;\n\u2022\nthe inability to repatriate foreign-based cash for strategic needs in the U.S., either at all or without incurring significant income tax and earnings consequences, as well as the heightened counterparty, internal control and country-specific risks associated with holding cash overseas;\n\u2022\nthe effect of foreign income taxes, value-added taxes and withholding taxes, including the inability to recover amounts owed to us by a government authority without extended proceedings or at all;\n\u2022\nthe effect of the U.S. tax treatment of foreign source income and losses, and other restrictions on the flow of capital between countries;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in local investment, local employment, local training or exchange control regulations;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on and taxation of international imports and exports;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, including the impact of hyper-inflationary conditions in certain economies, particularly where exchange controls limit or eliminate our ability to convert from local currency;\n\u2022\npolitical or economic instability, government nationalization of business or industries, government corruption and civil unrest, including political or economic instability in the countries of the Eurozone, Egypt, Russia, the\nMiddle East and certain markets in Latin America;\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory constraints, including tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\na significant portion of our sales are denominated in local currencies but reported in U.S. dollars, and a high percentage of product costs for such sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, although we may hedge a portion of the exposure, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to such currencies can negatively impact our reported sales and operating profits.\nThe U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly against most currencies, and our segment profit could be impacted by adverse currency movements.\nA failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our ability to conduct business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems, including some that are managed by third-party service providers, in order to conduct business. These systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to internal and external communications, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, and complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements. These information technology systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to the poor performance or failure of third party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events. If our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in conducting our business, which may adversely impact our operating results. In addition, we continuously assess and implement upgrades to improve our information technology systems globally. As such, during these implementation periods, we face a heightened risk of system interruptions and deficiencies or failures in our internal controls involving our information systems and processes.\nOur operations depend on the use of information technology systems that are subject to data privacy regulations and could be the target of cyberattack.\nOur systems and networks, as well as those of our retailer customers, suppliers, service providers, and banks, have and may in the future become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches, which in turn could result in the unauthorized release and misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our company, employees, customers or consumers, as well as disrupt our operations or damage our facilities or those of third parties. Additionally, our systems are subject to regulation to preserve the privacy of certain data held on those systems. As a result, a failure to comply with applicable regulations or an unauthorized breach or cyberattack could negatively impact our revenues and increase our operating and capital costs. It could also damage our reputation with retailer customers and consumers and diminish the strength and reputation of our brands, or require us to pay monetary penalties. We may also be required to incur additional costs to modify or enhance our systems or in order to try to prevent or remediate any such attacks.\nIf we cannot continue to develop new products in a timely manner, market them at favorable margins, and maintain attractive performance standards in our existing products, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe battery, portable lighting, automotive fragrance and appearance products industries have been notable for developments in product life, product design and applied technology, and our success depends on future innovations by us. The successful development and introduction of new products requires retail and consumer acceptance and overcoming the reaction from competitors. New product introductions in categories where we have existing products will likely also reduce the sales of our existing products. Our investments in research and development may not result in successful products or innovation that will recover the costs of such investments. Our customers or end consumers may not purchase our new products once introduced. Additionally, new products could require regulatory approval which may not be available or may require modification to the product which could impact the production process. Our competitors may introduce new or enhanced products that outperform ours, or develop manufacturing technology that permits them to manufacture at a lower cost relative to ours and sell at a lower price. If we fail to develop and launch successful new products or fail to reduce our cost structure to a competitive level, we may be unable to grow our business and compete successfully.\nOur business also depends on our ability to continue to manufacture our existing products to meet the applicable product performance claims we have made to our customers. Any decline in these standards could result in the loss of business and negatively impact our performance and financial results. Finally, our ability to maintain favorable margins on our products requires us to manage our manufacturing and other production costs relative to our prices. We may not be able to increase our prices in the event that our production costs increase, which would decrease our profit margins and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nOur business is subject to increasing regulation in the U.S. and abroad.\nThe manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, advertising and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S., including by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, and by the Federal Trade Commission with respect to advertising. Similar regulations have been adopted by authorities in foreign countries where we sell our products, and by state and local authorities in the U.S. Legislation is continually being introduced in the United States and other countries, and new or more restrictive regulations or more restrictive interpretations of existing regulations, particularly in the battery industry, are likely and could have an adverse impact on our business. Legislative and regulatory changes by taxing authorities have an impact on our effective tax rate, and we may be subject to additional costs arising from new or changed regulations, including those relating to health care and energy. Additionally, a finding that we are in violation of, or not in compliance with, applicable laws or regulations in the areas above, as well laws or regulations related to competition/antitrust, anti-corruption, trade compliance, data privacy and other areas, could subject us to material civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions, product recalls, or criminal sanctions. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is not merited or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions could jeopardize our reputation and brand image and have a material adverse effect on our businesses, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant liabilities.\nWe must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, recycling of batteries and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances. A release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties. Pursuant to certain environmental laws, we could be subject to joint and several strict liability for contamination relating to our or our predecessors\u2019 current or former properties or any of their respective third-party waste disposal sites. In addition to potentially significant investigation and remediation costs, any such contamination can give rise to claims from governmental authorities or other third parties for natural resource damage, personal injury, property damage or other liabilities. Contamination has been identified at certain of our current and former facilities as well as third-party waste disposal sites, and we are conducting investigation and remediation activities in relation to such properties. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of further cleanup obligations at these or other properties could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenses and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations. As new laws and regulations are introduced, we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe resolution of our tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities, which could adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nSignificant estimation and judgment are required in determining our tax provisions for taxes in the U.S. and jurisdictions outside the U.S. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly audited by tax authorities and, although we believe our tax positions are defensible and our tax provision estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. The unfavorable resolution of any audits or litigation could have an adverse impact on future operating results and our financial condition.\nChanges in production costs, including raw material prices, could erode our profit margins and negatively impact operating results.\nPricing and availability of raw materials, energy, shipping and other services needed for our business can be volatile due to general economic conditions, labor costs, production levels, import duties and tariffs and other factors beyond our control. There is no certainty that we will be able to offset future cost increases. This volatility can significantly affect our production cost and may, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur manufacturing facilities, supply channels or other business operations may be subject to disruption from events beyond our control.\nOperations of our manufacturing and packaging facilities worldwide and of our corporate offices, and the methods\nwe use to obtain supplies and to distribute our products, may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including availability of raw materials, work stoppages, industrial accidents, disruptions in logistics, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality or safety issues, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, trade disputes between countries in which we have operations, such as the U.S. and China, and acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, fire, earthquake, flooding or other natural disasters. The supply of our raw materials may be similarly disrupted. There is also a possibility that third-party manufacturers, which produce a significant portion of certain of our products, could discontinue production with little or no advance notice, or experience financial problems or problems with product quality or timeliness of product delivery, resulting in manufacturing delays or disruptions, regulatory sanctions, product liability claims or consumer complaints. If a major disruption were to occur, it could result in delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations. We maintain business interruption insurance to potentially mitigate the impact of business interruption, but such coverage may not be sufficient to offset the financial or reputational impact of an interruption.\nIn addition, sales of certain of our products tend to be seasonal. As a result of this seasonality, our inventory and working capital needs fluctuate significantly throughout the year. Orders from retailers are often made late in the period preceding the applicable peak season, making forecasting of production schedules and inventory purchases difficult. If we are unable to accurately forecast and prepare for customer orders or our working capital needs, or there is a general downturn in business or economic conditions during these periods, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have significant debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations.\nAs of September 30, 2016, our total aggregate outstanding indebtedness was approximately $1.05 billion, with $290.8 million of additional capacity available under a senior secured revolving credit facility, inclusive of issued and outstanding letters of credit totaling $6.7 million.\nThis significant amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our shareholders, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on this debt, thereby limiting the cash we have available to fund future growth opportunities, such as research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrestrictive covenants in our debt arrangements which limit our operations and borrowing, and place restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase common stock;\n\u2022\nthe risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt or rising interest rates on our variable rate debt increasing future debt costs and limiting the future availability of debt financing;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, due to the need to use our cash to service our outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged with debt and that may therefore be more able to invest in their business or use their available cash to pursue other opportunities, including acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.\nIn addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of our outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt.\nWe may need additional financing in the future, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, and may be dilutive to existing shareholders.\nIn addition to any debt obligations we incurred in connection with the separation, we may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes. For example, we may need to increase our investment in research and development activities or require funding to make acquisitions. We may be unable to obtain desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. For example, during periods of volatile credit markets, there is a risk that lenders, even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices, could fail or refuse to honor their credit commitments and obligations, including, but not limited to, extending credit up to the maximum permitted by a credit facility and otherwise accessing capital or honoring loan commitments. If our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their loan commitments or we are unable to borrow, it could be difficult to replace such loan commitments on similar terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund growth opportunities, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. If we\nraise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants. Generally, to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, all of the risks described above in connection with our debt obligations could increase.\nWe may not be able to achieve cost savings as a result of any current or future restructuring efforts.\nTo operate more efficiently and control costs, we have entered into, and may seek to enter into additional restructuring and cost reduction plans. We may be unable to identify cost savings opportunities to be achieved by such plans in the future. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions and other factors that we may not be able to control. We may also incur significant charges related to restructuring plans, which would reduce our profitability in the periods such charges are incurred.\nExecution of any restructuring program also presents a number of significant risks, including:\n\u2022\nactual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service standards to customers;\n\u2022\nthe failure to preserve adequate internal controls as we restructure our general and administrative functions, including our information technology and financial reporting infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe failure to preserve supplier relationships and distribution, sales and other important relationships and to resolve conflicts that may arise;\n\u2022\nloss of sales as we reduce or eliminate staffing for non-core product lines;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention from ongoing business activities; and\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees while implementing benefit changes and reductions in the workforce.\nWe may not be able to effectively design restructuring programs in the future, and when implementing restructuring plans we may not be able to predict whether we will realize the purpose and anticipated benefits of these measures and, if we do not, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market similar products, which could adversely affect our market share and results of operations.\nThe vast majority of our total revenues are from products bearing proprietary trademarks and brand names. In addition, we own or license from third parties a number of patents, patent applications and other technology. We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect or maintain our own intellectual property rights or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. In addition, even if such rights are protected in the United States, the laws of some other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We cannot be certain that our intellectual property rights will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future, and we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights. As patents expire, we could face increased competition, which could negatively impact our operating results. If other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights, they may dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace, which could diminish the value that consumers associate with our brands and harm our sales.\nOur future financial performance and success are dependent on our ability to execute our business strategies successfully.\nOur products are currently marketed and sold through a dedicated commercial organization and exclusive and non-exclusive third-party distributors and wholesalers. As part of the separation, we increased our use of exclusive and non-exclusive third-party distributors and wholesalers. We also decreased or eliminated our business operations in certain countries with large numbers of local and regional low-cost competitors in order to increase our profitability. In addition, we shifted from a decentralized management structure to a model in which many functions are managed centrally. We expect that these changes in our business strategy will enable us to reach new retail customers and consumers, and focus our business operations on more profitable markets. However, the use of distributors in markets where we have historically maintained a direct presence could adversely impact the reputation of our brands and negatively impact our results of operations. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to efficiently implement our strategies in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, achieve the goals of our long-term business strategies, or meet competitive challenges. If we are unable to execute our business strategies successfully, our revenues and marketability may be adversely affected.\nIf we pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives, such as our recent auto care acquisition. With respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us, or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges. With respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges. Companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. Our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses, integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, and may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business involves the potential for claims of product liability and other tort claims against us, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition and result in product recalls or withdrawals.\nWe face exposure to claims arising out of alleged defects in our products, including for property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects. We maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance does not cover all types of claims, particularly claims that do not involve personal injury or property damage or claims that exceed the amount of insurance coverage. Further, we may not be able to maintain such insurance in sufficient amounts, on desirable terms, or at all, in the future. In addition to the risk of monetary judgments not covered by insurance, product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm our products\u2019 reputation and in certain cases require a product recall. Product withdrawals or product liability claims, and any subsequent remedial actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, brand value, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to attract, retain and develop key personnel.\nOur future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, retain and develop highly qualified personnel, including future members of our management team. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we can retain and motivate our key employees or attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future. Additionally, the escalating costs of offering and administering health care, retirement and other benefits for employees could result in reduced profitability.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s possible departure from the European Union could adversely affect us.\nThe June 23, 2016 referendum by United Kingdom voters to exit the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) adversely impacted global markets, including currencies, and resulted in a decline in the value of the British pound and the euro, as compared to the US dollar and other currencies. Volatility in exchange rates could be expected to continue in the short term as the United Kingdom negotiates its exit from the European Union. A weaker British pound and euro compared to the US dollar during a reporting period would cause local currency results of our United Kingdom and other European operations to be translated into fewer US dollars. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our United Kingdom and other European operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations. These changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nWe may experience losses or be subject to increased funding and expenses related to our pension plans.\nWe assumed pension plan liabilities related to our current and former employees in connection with the separation. Effective January 1, 2014, the pension benefit earned to date by active participants under the legacy U.S. pension plan was frozen and future retirement service benefits are no longer accrued under this retirement program; however, our pension plan obligations remain significant. If the investment of plan assets does not provide the expected long-term returns, if interest rates or other assumptions change, or if governmental regulations change the timing or amounts of required contributions to the plans, we could be required to make significant additional pension contributions, which may have an adverse impact on\nour liquidity, our ability to comply with debt covenants and may require recognition of increased expense within our financial statements.\nOur credit ratings are important to our cost of capital.\nWe expect that the major credit rating agencies will continue to evaluate our creditworthiness and give us specified credit ratings. These ratings would be based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and financial policies as well as our strategies, operations and execution. These credit ratings are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks related to investment in Energizer, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued. Nonetheless, the credit ratings we receive will impact our borrowing costs as well as our access to sources of capital on terms that will be advantageous to our business. Failure to obtain sufficiently high credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings, our liquidity or our competitive position and could also restrict our access to capital markets. There can be no assurance that any credit ratings we receive will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies if, in such rating agency\u2019s judgments, circumstances so warrant.\nRisks Related to the Spin-off\nWe have limited recent history of operating as an independent company, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical information about Energizer prior to our separation from our former parent refers to Energizer\u2019s business as operated by and integrated with our former parent. Our historical financial information prior to our separation from our former parent is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of our former parent. Accordingly, the historical financial information prior to our separation from our former parent does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below:\n\u2022\nPrior to the separation, our business was operated by our former parent as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Our former parent or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us, such as legal, treasury, accounting, auditing, human resources, investor relations, public affairs and finance. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from our former parent for such functions, which are likely to be less than the expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company.\n\u2022\nHistorically, we have shared economies of scope and scale with our former parent in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. Although we have entered into transition agreements with our former parent, these arrangements are limited in duration and may not fully capture the benefits that we have enjoyed as a result of being integrated with our former parent.\n\u2022\nAs a part of our former parent, we took advantage of our former parent's overall size and scope to procure more advantageous distribution arrangements, including shipping costs. As a standalone company, we may be unable to obtain similar arrangements to the same extent as our former parent did, or on terms as favorable as those our former parent obtained.\n\u2022\nThe cost of capital for our business may be higher than our former parent's cost of capital prior to the separation.\n\u2022\nIn connection with the separation, we shifted a portion of our business towards exclusive and non-exclusive third-party distribution arrangements rather than directly selling product to our retail customers. Retail customers who prefer to buy directly from us may reduce or terminate their purchases from us as a result of this new strategy. In addition, we cannot ensure that we will be able to negotiate the most advantageous distribution agreements, or that the third-party distributors will operate under the same standards as we would have or will not take actions that could damage our reputations or brands.\nOther significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from our former parent. For additional information about the past financial performance of our business and the basis of presentation of the historical consolidated financial statements see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the historical financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation, and the separation may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. We may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (a) we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if we were still a part of our former parent because our business is less diversified than our former parent's business prior to the completion of the separation; (b) we may be unable to obtain certain goods, services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable as those our former parent obtained prior to completion of the separation; and (c) the separation has entailed changes to our information technology systems, reporting systems, supply chain and other operations that may require significant expense and may not be implemented in an as timely and effective fashion as we expect. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn connection with our separation from our former parent, our former parent agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify our former parent for certain liabilities. If we are required to pay under these indemnities to our former parent, our financial results could be negatively impacted. The indemnity from our former parent may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which our former parent was allocated responsibility, and our former parent may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the separation agreement and certain other agreements with our former parent, our former parent agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify our former parent for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Indemnity payments that we may be required to provide to our former parent are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the separation and related transactions. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that our former parent has agreed to retain. Any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of our operating business. Further, the indemnity from our former parent may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and our former parent may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from our former parent any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify our former parent for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\nIn connection with our Spin-off, our former parent received an opinion of counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The opinion of counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, certain representations, statements and undertakings of Energizer, including those relating to the past and future conduct of Energizer. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if our former parent or Energizer breaches any of its covenants in the separation documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the \u201cIRS,\u201d could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. The opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert a contrary position.\nUnder the tax matters agreement with our former parent, Energizer may be required to indemnify our former parent against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of Energizer, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether Energizer participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), or (ii) other actions or failures to act by Energizer or any of Energizer\u2019s representations or undertakings in connection with the separation and the distribution being incorrect or violated. Any such indemnity obligations could be material. In addition, we may incur certain tax costs in connection with the separation, including non-U.S. tax costs resulting from separations in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material.\nWe may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capital-raising transactions due to the separation.\nUnder current law, a spin-off can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its shareholders as a result of certain post-spin-off acquisitions of shares or assets of the spun-off corporation. For example, a spin-off may result in taxable gain to the parent corporation under Section 355(e) of the Code if the spin-off were later deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares representing a 50% or greater interest (by vote or value) in the spun-off corporation. To preserve the tax-free treatment of the separation and the distribution, and in addition to Energizer\u2019s indemnity obligation described above, the tax matters agreement restricts Energizer, for the two-year period following the separation, except in specific circumstances, from: (i) entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of shares of Energizer common stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise, (ii) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing Energizer shares other than in certain open-market transactions, (iv) ceasing to actively conduct the Household Products businesses or (v) taking or failing to take any other action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. These restrictions may limit Energizer\u2019s ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions or other transactions that may maximize the value of Energizer\u2019s business.\nThe terms we received in our agreements with our former parent may be less beneficial than the terms we may have otherwise received from unaffiliated third parties.\nThe agreements we entered into with our former parent in connection with the separation, including a separation and distribution agreement, a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement and reciprocal trademark license agreements, were prepared in the context of the separation while Energizer was still a wholly owned subsidiary of our former parent. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were prepared, Energizer did not have an independent board of directors or a management team that was independent of our former parent. As a result, the terms of those agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. Arm\u2019s-length negotiations between our former parent and an unaffiliated third party in another form of transaction, such as a buyer in a sale of a business transaction, are likely to have resulted in more favorable terms to the unaffiliated third party.\nWe may be held liable to our former parent if we fail to perform certain services under the transition services agreement, and the performance of such services may negatively impact our business and operations.\nEnergizer and our former parent entered into a transition services agreement in connection with the separation pursuant to which Energizer and our former parent will provide each other certain transitional services, including treasury and employee benefits administration, information technology, distribution and importation, regulatory and general administrative services, on an interim, transitional basis. The fees we will be paid under the transition services agreement may not be adequate to compensate us for the costs of performing the services. If we do not satisfactorily perform our obligations under the agreement, we may be held liable for any resulting losses suffered by our former parent. In addition, during the transition services periods, our management and employees may be required to divert their attention away from our business in order to provide services to our former parent, which could adversely affect the business.\nOur former parent may fail to perform under various transaction agreements executed as part of the separation or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire.\nIn connection with the separation, Energizer and our former parent entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements, including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement and reciprocal trademark license agreements. The separation agreement, the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement, together with the documents and agreements by which the internal reorganization was effected, determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and included indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The transition services agreement provided for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the separation. If our former parent is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses. If we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once certain transaction agreements expire, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline. We are in the process of creating our own, or engaging third parties to provide, systems and services to replace many of the systems and services that our former parent currently provides to us. However, we may not be successful in implementing these systems and services or in transitioning\ndata from our former parent's systems to ours.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends or share repurchases on our common stock.\nAlthough we expect to pay regular cash dividends and conduct periodic share repurchase programs, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders or repurchases of the Company\u2019s common stock will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nThe Board\u2019s decisions regarding the payment of dividends or repurchase of shares will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of our debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and on our access to the capital markets. We cannot guarantee that we will pay a dividend or repurchase shares in the future or continue to pay any dividend or conduct share repurchase programs.\nYour percentage of ownership in Energizer may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, your percentage ownership in Energizer may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we grant to our directors, officers and employees. From time to time, we will issue additional stock-based awards to our employees under our employee benefits plans.\nSuch awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, our amended and restated articles of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws, and of Missouri law, may deter or delay an acquisition of Energizer.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and the General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri, which we refer to as \u201cMissouri law,\u201d contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover by making the replacement of incumbent directors more time-consuming and difficult. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe inability of our shareholders to call a special meeting;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how we may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe initial division of our Board of Directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term;\n\u2022\na provision that our shareholders may only remove directors \u201cfor cause\u201d and with the approval of the holders of two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock at a special meeting of shareholders called expressly for that purpose;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our directors, and not shareholders, to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that any amendment or repeal of specified provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation (including provisions relating to directors, calling special meetings, shareholder-initiated business and director nominations, action by written consent and amendment of our amended and restated bylaws) must be approved by the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our common stock and any other voting shares that may be outstanding, voting together as a single class.\nIn addition, because we have not chosen to opt out of coverage of Section 351.459 of Missouri law, which we refer to as the \u201cbusiness combination statute,\u201d these provisions could also deter or delay a change of control. The business combination statute restricts certain business combination transactions between us and an \u201cinterested shareholder,\u201d generally any person who, together with his or her affiliates and associates, owns or controls 20% or more of the outstanding shares of our voting stock, for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person becomes an interested shareholder, unless either such transaction or the interested shareholder\u2019s acquisition of stock is approved by our Board on or before the date the interested shareholder obtains such status. The business combination statute also provides that, after the expiration of such five-year period, business combinations are prohibited unless (i) the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting stock, other than the stock owned by the interested shareholder, or any affiliate or associate of such interested shareholder, approve the business combination or (ii) the business combination satisfies certain detailed fairness and procedural requirements.\nWe believe that these provisions will help to protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could deter or delay an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in our best interests or the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nIn addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the tax matters agreement, Energizer could be required to indemnify our former parent for the resulting tax, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that you may consider favorable.\n1B.
