RISK FACTORS.\nSet forth below are certain risk factors that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. You should carefully read the following risk factors, together with the consolidated financial statements, related notes, and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that contain risks and uncertainties. Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in Item 7. under the heading \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in connection with your consideration of the risk factors and other important factors that may affect future results described below.\nI.Risks Related to the Healthcare Industry\nHealth care reform has initiated significant changes to the United States health care system and we expect to see further changes in the health care system in the future.\nVarious health care reform provisions became law upon enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, on March 23, 2010 (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d). The reforms contained in the Affordable Care Act have impacted our business. Continued political, economic, and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the United States to fundamental change. Further changes relating to the health care industry and in health care spending may adversely affect our revenue. We anticipate that Congress will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation effecting additional fundamental changes in the health care system. Although efforts at replacing the Affordable Care Act and overhauling the health care system have stalled in Congress, the change of administration and control of the Senate following the 2020 election cycle suggests that the risk of repeal of the Affordable Care Act is reduced. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing or effect of changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of potential legislation on our business. However, although the specific reforms to the current health care system cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such changes could have a considerable impact on how health care is reimbursed, particularly on the coverage for certain types of services and on the reimbursement levels provided by government sources.\nChanges in government reimbursement levels could adversely affect our Patient Care segment\u2019s net revenue, cash flows, and profitability.\nWe derived approximately 58.5%, 57.7%, and 57.5% of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, from reimbursements for O&P services and products from programs administered by Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA. Each of these programs set reimbursement levels for the O&P services and products provided under their program. If these agencies reduce reimbursement levels for O&P services and products in the future, our net revenues could substantially decline. In addition, the percentage of our net revenues derived from these sources may increase as the portion of the U.S. population over age 65 continues to grow, making us more vulnerable to reimbursement reductions by these organizations. Reduced government reimbursement levels could result in reduced private payor reimbursement levels because fee schedules of certain third party payors are indexed to Medicare reimbursement levels. Furthermore, the health care industry is experiencing a trend towards cost containment as government and other third party payors seek to impose\nlower reimbursement rates and negotiate reduced contract rates with service providers. This trend could adversely affect our net revenues. For example, the Medicare contractor for Pricing, Data Analysis and Coding (referred to as \u201cPDAC\u201d) recently announced verification requirements and code changes that have reduced the reimbursement level for certain prosthetic feet, and the VA is in the process of reassessing the method it uses to determine reimbursement levels for O&P services and products provided under certain miscellaneous codes. Additionally, a number of states have reduced their Medicaid reimbursement rates for O&P services and products, or have reduced Medicaid eligibility, and at any time some number of other states are reviewing Medicaid reimbursement policies generally, including for prosthetic and orthotic devices. Similarly, the federal government is continually evaluating potentially significant changes to the Medicaid program, including, but not limited to changing the nature and scope of Medicaid reimbursement. Any significant reduction in reimbursement levels under programs administered by Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues.\nMedicare provides for reimbursement for O&P products and services based on prices set forth in fee schedules for eight regional service areas. Medicare prices are adjusted each year based on the CPI-U unless Congress acts to change or eliminate the adjustment. The Medicare price changes for 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were 5.1%, 0.2%, 0.9%, and 2.3%, respectively. The Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) changed the Medicare inflation factors applicable to O&P (and other) suppliers. The annual updates for years subsequent to 2011 are based on the percentage increase in the CPI-U for the 12-months ended in June of the previous year. Section 3401(m) of the ACA required that for 2011 and each subsequent year, the fee schedule update factor based on the CPI-U for the 12-months ended in June of the previous year is to be adjusted by the 10-year moving average of changes in annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multifactor productivity (as projected by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services for the 10-year period ending with the applicable fiscal year, year, cost reporting period, or other annual period) (the \u201cMFP Adjustment\u201d). The MFP Adjustment may result in the percentage increase being less than zero for a year and may result in payment rates for a year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year. If the U.S. Congress were to legislate additional modifications to the Medicare fee schedules, our net revenues from Medicare and other payors could be adversely and materially affected.\nRegular challenges to the ACA occur in the federal courts. The ACA survived the third round of court challenges in California v. Texas, 141 S.Ct. 2104 (2021) when the Supreme Court on June 17, 2021 held that plaintiffs, including certain individuals and twenty (20) states, lacked standing to sue to overturn the ACA. Despite the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, future legal challenges to the ACA are possible as rejection of the principles behind the ACA remains a focus of various political candidates\u2019 campaign platforms, and leadership of the states that challenged the law remain opposed to the law. If any challenges to the ACA are successful, it may have a material adverse effect on our net revenues.\nAlternative models of reimbursement for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (\u201cDMEPOS\u201d) may also affect our business. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 requires that Medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for certain DMEPOS items and services with \u201csingle payment amounts\u201d determined through a competitive bidding process, and CMS has issued regulations finalizing the methodology for adjusting fee schedule amounts for such items. See 79 Fed. Reg. 66,120, 66,124 (Nov. 6, 2014). The types of DMEPOS most applicable to us include certain off-the-shelf (\u201cOTS\u201d) orthotics. Under the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program, suppliers compete to submit bids for selected products, and the Medicare suppliers offering the best price, in addition to meeting applicable quality and financial standards, are awarded contracts to supply the designated products and services to Medicare beneficiaries in specified competitive bidding areas. Although our product offerings currently subject to competitive bidding do not comprise a significant portion of our business, it is possible that the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program may expand to include other types of products we offer, or that other payors will adopt similar models for reimbursement, which could negatively affect our net revenue.\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011 required, among other things, mandatory across-the-board reductions in Federal spending, or \u201csequestration\u201d. While delayed by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, President Obama issued a sequestration order on March 1, 2013. For services provided on or after April 1, 2013, Medicare fee-for-service claim payments, including those for DMEPOS as well as claims under the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program, are reduced by 2%. Section 3709 of the CARES Act temporarily suspended the 2% payment adjustment applied to Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) claims due to sequestration for claims with dates of service from May 1 through December 31, 2020. The Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2021, signed into law on December 27, 2020, extended the suspension period to March 31, 2021. An Act to Prevent Across-the-Board Direct Spending Cuts, and for Other Purposes, signed into law on April 14, 2021, extended the suspension period to December 31, 2021. The Protecting Medicare and American Farmers From Sequester Cuts Act, signed into law December 10, 2021, extended the extension period to March 31, 2022, with a 1% reduction from April 1 to June 30, 2022, and the full 2% payment reduction on and after July 1, 2022. On November 2, 2015, President Obama signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 into law, which provided for two years of increases to discretionary spending to be offset by an\nadditional year of Medicare sequestration, through 2025. This is a claims payment adjustment with limited impact on us; no permanent reductions in the Medicare DMEPOS fee schedule have been made as a result of sequestration, therefore additional reimbursements from Medicaid, the VA, and commercial payors who use the Medicare fee schedule as a basis for reimbursement have not been impacted.\nCMS may also develop policies to limit Medicare coverage of specific products and services. Medicare administrative contractors may issue local coverage determinations (\u201cLCD\u201d) that limit coverage for a particular item or service, and these determinations are generally coordinated across all applicable Medicare administrative contractors and therefore generally apply nationally. Any LCD that negatively impacts orthotic or prosthetic reimbursement would negatively affect our revenue.\nFinally, patients may continue to move to Medicare Advantage plans from traditional Medicare plans, which will change the nature of the reimbursement received by us from the traditional Medicare program and may negatively affect our net revenue.\nIf the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, then it would have a material adverse effect on our Patient Care segment\u2019s net revenues, earnings, and cash flows.\nWe derived approximately 34.8%, 35.7%, and 35.8% of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, from reimbursements for O&P services and products for patients who have commercial payors as their primary payor. We continue to experience downward pressure on some of our commercial payment rates as a result of general conditions in the market, recent, and future consolidations among commercial payors, increased focus on O&P services and products and other factors. There is no guarantee that commercial payment rates will not be materially lower in the future, particularly given the fluctuations in government reimbursement rates.\nWe are continuously in the process of negotiating new agreements and renegotiating agreements that are up for renewal with commercial payors, who often begin negotiations with proposed reductions in our reimbursement rates. Sometimes many significant agreements are up for renewal or being renegotiated at the same time. In the event that our ongoing negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, the cumulative effect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Consolidations in the commercial payor market have significantly increased the negotiating leverage of commercial payors. Our negotiations with payors are also influenced by competitive pressures, and we may experience decreased contracted rates with commercial payors or experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. If the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, or if we see a decline in commercial patients, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings, and cash flows.\nWe depend on reimbursements by third party payors, as well as payments by individuals, which could lead to delays and uncertainties in the Patient Care segment\u2019s reimbursement process.\nWe receive a substantial portion of our payments for health care services on a fee-for-service basis from third party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, private insurers, and managed care organizations. We estimate that we have received approximately 93.3%, 93.4%, and 93.3% of our net revenues from such third party payors during 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We estimate that such amounts included approximately 31.4%, 32.3%, and 31.9% from Medicare in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, 17.6%, 16.2%, and 15.8% from Medicaid programs in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In addition, we estimate net revenues from the VA were 9.5%, 9.2%, and 9.8% in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nThe reimbursement process is complex and can involve lengthy delays. Third party payors continue their efforts to control expenditures for health care, including proposals to revise reimbursement policies. While we recognize revenue when health care services are provided, there can be delays before we receive payment. In addition, third party payors may disallow, in whole or in part, requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage, that services provided were not medically necessary, or that additional supporting documentation is necessary. Retroactive adjustments may change amounts realized from third party payors. Third party payors may require pre-authorizations for certain services and/or devices, which may result in a delay in our ability to provide services or to provide services at all. Additionally, we may see an increase in bundled payment models, which can result in delays before we receive payment or no payment at all for certain services.\nChanges in government reimbursement levels and policies such as those described above may also contribute to uncertainties surrounding the reimbursement process. We are subject to governmental audits of our reimbursement claims under Medicare, Medicaid, the VA, and other governmental programs and may be required to repay these agencies if found that we\nwere incorrectly reimbursed. Delays and uncertainties in the reimbursement process may adversely affect accounts receivable, increase the overall costs of collection and cause us to incur additional borrowing costs.\nWe also may not be paid with respect to co-payments and deductibles that are the patient\u2019s financial responsibility. Many of the plans offered on the state health insurance exchanges have high deductibles and require coinsurance that patients cannot afford to pay. Amounts not covered by third party payors are the obligations of individual patients from whom we may not receive whole or partial payment. We also may not receive whole or partial payments from uninsured and underinsured individuals. In such an event, our earnings and cash flow would be adversely affected, potentially affecting our ability to maintain our restrictive debt covenant ratios and meet our financial obligations.\nAdditionally, employer based plans and other individual plans are increasingly relying on \u201chigh deductible\u201d plan designs. As their participation in health plans with these high deductible designs increases, our patients will face greater financial burdens and participatory costs that may affect their decisions regarding the timing of their replacement of their devices. Due to cost considerations, they may seek to repair or refurbish their existing devices and delay the purchase of new replacement devices, which will adversely affect our revenues and our profitability.\nThe risks associated with third party payors, co-payments, and deductibles and the inability to monitor and manage accounts receivable successfully could still have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, our collection policies or our provisions for allowances for Medicare, Medicaid, and contractual discounts and doubtful accounts receivable may not be adequate.\nAnother recent development that may impact both rates of payment and administrative expense relates to state and federal responses to so-called \u201csurprise billing.\u201d The federal No Surprises Act was enacted on December 27, 2020 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. It was generally designed to provide protection from patients being surprised by bills for health care and patient cost-sharing payment obligations when receiving care from certain providers who are \u201cout-of-network\u201d (\u201cOON\u201d) with a given health plan. The protection is generally aimed at situations where patients (i) receive care from OON providers who furnish services at in-network facilities, (ii) receive emergency care from OON providers, or (iii) use OON air ambulances. While our facilities are not directly regulated by the No Surprises Act, when our professionals provide services through or at a covered health care provider (such as a hospital) we may be impacted by the new law, which became effective on January 1, 2022. Additionally, various of the states are experimenting with their own legislative solutions to \u201csurprise billing,\u201d with laws and requirements that may extend beyond the scope of the No Surprises Act. An example of such a law is in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which enacted a change to M.G.L. Chapter 111 Section 228, which was also effective on January 1, 2022, but with penalties for noncompliance deferred to July 1, 2022. One side-effect of these laws, in addition to subjecting health care providers to additional administrative expense and risk of penalties, is that health insurers are already using the laws to extract additional discounts and rate reductions from participating providers. If the health insurers extend this approach to our services and contracts, that may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nDue to constraints in the growth of our rates of reimbursement, we may face cost pressures that could adversely affect our profitability.\nDue to increased pressures on governmental and commercial payors to seek ways of reducing the costs of care, those payors have and may continue to seek ways to reduce growth in the rate of our reimbursement for the services we provide. This constraint in the rate of growth in reimbursement may adversely affect our profitability as we experience increases in the wages, materials, and other costs necessary to the conduct of our business. These cost increases may adversely affect our profitability and our profit margins.\nChanges in government reimbursement levels could adversely affect our Products & Services segment\u2019s net revenues, cash flows, and profitability.\nChanges in government reimbursement levels could adversely affect the net revenues, cash flows, and profitability of the businesses in our Products & Services segment. In particular, a significant majority of our therapeutic services sales involve devices and related services provided to SNFs and similar businesses. Reductions in government reimbursement levels to SNFs have caused, and could continue to cause, such SNFs to reduce or cancel their use of our therapeutic service equipment and related consultative services negatively impacting net revenues, cash flows, and profitability. For example, in July 2011 CMS announced an across the board reduction of approximately 11% in SNF reimbursement levels, which negatively impacted the demand for our devices and treatment modalities. Although CMS has announced increases in SNF reimbursement levels in the years since (the agency announced an increase of 1.2% for fiscal year (\u201cFY\u201d) 2022, 2.2% for FY\n2021, 2.4% for FY 2020, 2.4% for FY 2019, 1.0% for FY 2018), we cannot predict whether any other changes to reimbursement levels will be implemented, or if implemented what form any changes might take. Effective October 1, 2019, the Patient-Driven Payment Model replaced the previous Resource Utilization Group IV SNF payment system under Medicare Part A.\nWe face periodic reviews, audits, and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies, and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business.\nWe contract with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide O&P services. Pursuant to these contracts, we are subject to various governmental reviews, audits, and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse review, audit, or investigation could result in:\n\u2022refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts;\n\u2022imposition of fines, penalties, and other sanctions on us;\n\u2022loss of our right to participate in various federal programs;\n\u2022damage to our reputation in various markets; or\n\u2022material and/or adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the recent past, we saw a significant increase in Medicare audits with a temporary suspension of audit activity due to the public health emergency associated with COVID-19. However, Medicare audit activity has resumed, which includes RAC audits, CERT audits, TPE prepayment audits, and UPIC audits. In addition, SMRCs are responsible for the identification of improper payment rates through medical record review. We believe that Medicare audits, inquiries and investigations will continue to occur from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Medicare audits could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations, particularly if we are unsuccessful at final adjudication.\nII. Risks Related to Our Operations and Strategy\nOur results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover, and labor cost increases.\nWe have from time-to-time experienced labor shortages and other labor-related issues. These labor shortages have become more pronounced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us in one or more of our markets, including high employment levels, and federal and state government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers\u2019 health and safety, wage and hour practices, and immigration. These factors can also impact the cost of labor. Increased turnover rates within our employee base can lead to decreased efficiency and increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees. An overall labor shortage or lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur results of operations can be adversely affected by inflation and other general cost increases.\nWe are subject to both contractual, inflationary, and other general cost increases, including with regard to our labor costs and purchases of raw materials and transportation services. If we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases, growth, and/or cost reductions in our operations, these inflationary and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn 2021, our total company costs including our materials costs, personnel costs, other operating costs, and general & administrative expenses totaled $1,015.3 million. A 1% inflationary increase in this amount would increase costs by approximately $10.2 million.\nCyber attacks, system security risks, data breaches, and other technology failures could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, our results of operations, and our financial position.\nA cyber attack, system security risk, data breach or technology failure could occur and potentially disrupt our business, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our profitability. Our IT systems are subject to the risk of computer viruses or\nother malicious code, unauthorized access, or cyber attacks from a variety of sources, including directly, through a vendor with access to our IT systems, or through code embedded in a program or application we run on our IT systems. The risk of system attacks or cyber incidents is not limited to threats to our IT systems, but also includes compromises of the IT systems of vendors and third parties with which we do business.\nThe administrative and technical controls and other preventive measures that we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our IT systems may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber attacks, or other security breaches to our computer systems. We are not currently in full compliance with the standards prescribed under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, and this could result in heightened cybersecurity risk. In addition, disruptions or breaches could occur as a result of natural disasters, man-made disasters, epidemic/pandemic, industrial accident, blackout, criminal activity, technological changes or events, terrorism, or other unanticipated events beyond our control. While we have insurance intended to provide coverage from certain losses related to such incidents, and a variety of preventative security measures such as risk management, information protection, and disaster recovery systems, insurance may not cover all losses and our preventive security measures may not be sufficient or adequate to protect our IT systems. Additionally, we cannot predict the method or outcome of every possible cyber incident or ensure that we have protected ourselves against every possible cyber threat in light of the varied and increasingly complex breaches faced by companies on a regular basis. Problems with, or shortcomings in, our systems or plans could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business, our results of operations, and our financial position.\nWe utilize information technology systems to support our business. Our multi-year implementation of an enterprise-wide resource planning system, reliance upon multiple legacy business systems, security breaches, or other disruptions to our information technology systems or assets, could interfere with our operations, compromise security of our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 information and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation.\nOur operations rely on certain key IT systems, many of which are legacy in nature or may be dependent upon third-party services, to provide critical connections of data, information, and services for internal and external users. Over the next several years, we expect to implement a new enterprise resource planning system (\u201cERP\u201d), which will require significant financial and human resources to deploy. There can be no assurance that the actual costs for the ERP will not materially exceed our current estimates or that the ERP will not take longer to successfully implement than we currently expect. The failure to successfully implement the ERP in a timely manner may adversely affect our ability to establish and maintain an effective control environment. In addition, potential flaws in implementing the ERP, not adequately training our work force or adapting our systems and processes to effectively operate under the ERP, or the failure of any portion/module of the ERP to meet our needs, properly interface with legacy systems or provide appropriate controls, may pose risks to our ability to operate successfully and efficiently. There may be other challenges and risks to both our aging and current IT systems over time due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, availability of resources, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and as we upgrade and standardize our ERP system on a company-wide basis. These challenges and risks could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties, disruption to our operations, a material weakness in or failure of our control environment, loss of valuable data, and damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business.\nDisruptions in our disaster recovery systems, management continuity planning, or information systems could limit our ability to operate our business effectively, or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur IT systems facilitate our ability to conduct our business. While we have disaster recovery systems in place, these systems may not be adequate, and any disruptions in our disaster recovery systems could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations. Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our technology systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our management personnel were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be adversely affected.\nWe have made and may continue to make acquisitions, which could divert the attention of management and which may not be integrated successfully into our existing business. We may not find suitable acquisitions in the future, which could adversely affect our ability to penetrate new markets and achieve our growth objectives.\nWe intend to continue to pursue acquisitions to enter new geographic markets and expand the scope of services we provide. We cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates, acquisitions will be completed on acceptable terms or at all, our due diligence process will uncover all potential liabilities or issues affecting our integration process, we\nwill not incur breakup, termination or similar fees and expenses, or we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired business. Furthermore, acquisitions in new geographic markets and services may require us to comply with new and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements, which could impose substantial obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources, and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for noncompliance with such requirements. The acquisitions could be of significant size and involve operations in multiple jurisdictions. The acquisition and integration of another business could divert management attention from other business activities. This diversion, together with other difficulties we may incur in integrating an acquired business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we may incur debt to finance acquisitions. Such borrowings may not be available on terms as favorable to us as our current borrowing terms and may increase our leverage.\nWe face new competitors in the O&P patient care services market.\nThe barriers to entry into the O&P patient care services business in the United States are generally low. In particular, we are aware that two O&P product manufacturers, each with international O&P patient care services operations, also now operate O&P patient care services business in the United States, and could continue to expand their U.S. presence. These O&P product manufacturers are important suppliers to our O&P patient care services business as well as our Product & Services segment distribution business. Other O&P product manufacturers with international O&P patient care services operations could also choose to enter the U.S. O&P patient care services market, as could other healthcare companies. These competitors have significant financial resources, established brands, and other competitive strengths. The continued expansion of these competitors, and the entry of new competitors into the O&P patient care services market in the United States, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn addition, these competitors could negatively impact our acquisition strategy in the O&P patient care services market. In particular, competition for acquisition candidates could increase the prices we pay to complete acquisitions, and could cause us to lose acquisitions to competitors, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe O&P patient care services industry in the United States is consolidating, and this consolidation could adversely affect the distribution business in our Products & Services segment.\nIn recent years the O&P patient care services industry in the United States has been consolidating, and that consolidation is accelerating. The primary customers of the distribution business in our Products & Services Segment are these independent O&P patient care service providers. If the consolidation of these independent O&P provider customers were to cause them to source their purchases of O&P products, components and supplies from another supplier, it could adversely affect the net revenue, cash flow and profitability of our distribution business and the Products & Services segment.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2022 and beyond may continue to be materially adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) outbreak.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 evolved into a global pandemic in the first quarter of 2020. The full extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will continue to impact our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new medical and other information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions by governmental entities or others to contain it or mitigate its impact.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations in 2021 and 2020. We experienced a reduction in revenue due to a decline in the number of patients that we treated in our patient care clinics, as well as a reduction in sales to independent O&P clinics by our distribution business. A significant portion of this decline was due to O&P patients determining voluntarily to wait for various reasons, including concerns regarding their own health and safety, for appointments and procedures, both with us and with their referring physicians, that the patient deems to be non-urgent or otherwise able to be deferred or postponed. Although we have seen some recovery in patient volume since April of 2020, and sequentially since the second quarter of 2020, the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic has been erratic, with infection rates fluctuating as new variants, including the Delta and Omicron variants that emerged throughout the United States in 2021, and we are unable to predict when the COVID-19 pandemic will no longer significantly impact our patient volumes, both in our own clinics and at independent O&P providers.\nNevertheless, we continue to believe that these patient volume declines attributed to COVID-19 in 2021 and 2020 primarily reflect a deferral of healthcare services during those periods, rather than a permanent reduction in demand for our services. To date, we have not experienced significantly extended billing and collection cycles as a result of displaced employees,\ndelayed reimbursement by governmental or private payers, or delayed revenue cycle management procedures; however, we cannot predict the impact the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have on these areas of our operations in future periods. We may also face a shortage in products within our supply chain in the future, which could impact our ability to service our patients in our clinics on a timely basis or at all.\nOur management of the impact of COVID-19 has and will continue to require significant investment of time from our management and employees, as well as resources across our enterprise. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward existing or new initiatives or investments, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFurther, the impacts of COVID-19 have caused significant uncertainty and volatility in the credit markets. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, or if costs of capital increased significantly due the impact of COVID-19 including, volatility in the capital markets, a reduction in our credit ratings or other factors, then our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nThere have been several new sources of funding that flowed from Federal and state sources to health care providers and suppliers relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. We received approximately $1.1 million and $24.0 million, during 2021 and 2020, respectively, in grants under the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, also referred to as the CARES Act, which established to reimburse providers for lost revenue and health-care related expenses that are attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will be required to attest to and comply with the terms and conditions of any funding that we receive under the Provider Relief Fund, and to track our use of the funds in order to demonstrate such compliance. Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services surrounding compliance requirements continues to emerge and evolve, resulting in increased complexity in our reporting obligations related to the payments received under the Provider Relief Fund. If we fail to appropriately comply with all of the terms and conditions, we may be required to repay some or all of these amounts and may be subject to other enforcement action, which could have a material adverse impact. There is still a significant degree of uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the CARES Act, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act and other enacted legislation. Many of the potential requirements under these sources of funding were not promulgated pursuant to notice-and-comment rulemaking but were, rather, issued as subregulatory guidance, responses to frequently asked questions and other informal issuances, the content and substance of which changed materially and regularly. There can be no assurance that the terms and conditions of provider relief funding or other relief programs will not change or be interpreted in ways that affect our ability to comply with such terms and conditions in the future (which could affect our ability to retain any funding that we receive), the amount of total stimulus funding we may ultimately receive or our eligibility to participate in any future stimulus funding. We continue to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and government responses to the pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe foregoing and other continued disruptions to our business as a result of COVID-19 has had, and is currently expected to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDisruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our net revenue, cash flow, and profitability.\nWe depend on domestic and international outside suppliers and O&P product manufacturers to provide the materials, components, and products we use in the devices we provide to the patients of our Patient Care segment, and distribute to the customers of our distribution business in our Products & Services segment. Disruption of our supply chain could result from a variety of factors that could impact our suppliers, manufacturers, or shipping carriers. These factors include, among other things: a natural disaster, including a hurricane, earthquake, or flood; a public health crisis, including a global or regional pandemic outbreak of disease; adverse weather; a cybersecurity breach or incident; terrorism or other acts of violence; acts of war or other armed conflict; operational or financial instability of one or more key suppliers, manufacturers or shipping carriers; unavailability of raw materials; transportation interruptions or delays; or labor strikes or other labor activities. To date, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have not had a material adverse impact on our supply chain; however, we cannot provide assurance future developments will not result in a significant disruption to our supply chain. Any discontinuation or interruption in the availability of the materials, components, and products we use and sell in our businesses from one or more suppliers or manufacturers could increase our cost of materials, or delay or preclude deliveries to our patients and customers, which could have an adverse effect on our net revenue, cash flow, and profitability.\nConsolidation of manufacturers within the O&P industry may adversely affect our business by increasing prices we pay for certain devices and components.\nWe depend on a limited number of manufacturers who supply us with certain key devices and components used in the prostheses we provide to our patients, particularly with respect to high technology components. These manufacturers are subject to a consolidation trend within the O&P industry. To the extent this trend continues, consolidation amongst certain manufacturers could result in a sole or limited source for certain high technology devices and components used in the devices we provide to patients. Any such consolidation could require us to pay increased prices for such devices and components, which could significantly reduce our gross margin and profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn order to remain competitive, we are required to make capital expenditures to maintain our systems, properties, and our equipment.\nIn order to remain competitive, we are required to make capital expenditures to invest in reengineering our supply chain and financial systems, in therapeutic equipment for our Products & Services segment, and to refurbish and maintain our property and equipment generally. A substantial portion of our anticipated capital expenditure requirements over the next several years relate to updating and refreshing the physical and technology infrastructure that supports logistics and warehousing of products for both our business segments. We also continue to invest in refreshing the therapeutic equipment portfolio of Accelerated Care Plus in our Products & Services segment, and in upgrading and maintaining the appearance and function of our patient care clinics and satellite locations in our Patient Care segment. If we are unable to fund any such investment or otherwise fail to invest in such items, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur products and services face the risk of technological obsolescence, which, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change. There can be no assurance that third parties will not succeed in developing and marketing technologies, products or services that are more effective than those that we provide our patients, or that would render the products and services we provide our patients obsolete or noncompetitive. Additionally, new surgical procedures and medications could be developed for diabetes, trauma associated with accidents or physical injury, tumors, infection, or musculoskeletal disorders of the back, extremities, or joints that would replace or reduce the importance of our prosthetic and orthotic products and services. Accordingly, our success will depend upon our ability to respond to future medical and technological changes that may impact the demand for our prosthetic and orthotic products and services.\nWe depend on our ability to recruit and retain experienced clinicians.\nOur revenue generation is dependent upon referrals from physicians in the communities our patient care clinics serve, and our ability to maintain good relations with these physicians. Our clinicians are the front line for generating these referrals and we are dependent on their talents and skills to successfully cultivate and maintain strong relationships with these physicians. If we cannot recruit and retain our base of experienced and skilled clinicians, our business may decrease and our net operating revenues may decline. We may also experience increases in our labor costs, if higher wages and greater benefits are required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel, and such increases may adversely affect our profitability. Furthermore, while we attempt to manage overall labor costs in the most efficient way, our efforts to manage them may have limited effectiveness and may lead to increased turnover and other challenges.\nGiven the complexities and demands related to reimbursement, we may fail to adequately provide the staffing and systems necessary to ensure we effectively manage our reimbursement processes.\nThe nature of our business requires that we are effective in the assessment of patient eligibility, the process of pre-authorization, the recordation and collection of provider documentation, the timely and complete submission of claims for reimbursement, the application of cash receipts to patient accounts, the timely response to payor denials, and the conduct of collection activities. If we fail to provide adequate or qualified staffing, we could incur reductions in the amount of reimbursement we receive for the O&P services that we provide.\nIf we are unable to retain our senior management and key employees, then our business and results of operations and financial position could be harmed.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent on the services of our senior management and other key employees. Although we have employment agreements with our senior management, these agreements do not prevent those individuals from ceasing their employment with us at any time. If we are unable to retain existing senior management and other key employees, or to attract other such qualified employees on terms satisfactory to us, then our business could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to economically procure necessary components and to conduct timely and effective inventories of the materials and components we use in our business could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the use of materials and componentry we acquire from third party manufacturers. If manufacturers critical to our business substantially increase the cost of the components they sell to us, then our inability to acquire the necessary materials and components on a cost effective basis may adversely affect revenues and earnings. Additionally, to successfully perform our business, it is necessary that we conduct timely and thorough inventories of our raw materials and Work in Process. The conduct of these inventories is costly and time consuming. If we encounter issues in their conduct, given that our clinicians oversee the inventory processes which occur in our clinics, remedial procedures can disrupt our ability to see and treat patients, and thereby adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nInsurance coverage for some of our losses may be inadequate and may be subject to the credit risk of commercial insurance companies.\nSome of our insurance coverage is through various third-party insurers. To the extent we hold policies to cover certain groups of claims or rely on insurance coverage obtained by third parties to cover such claims, but either we or such third parties did not obtain sufficient insurance limits, did not buy an extended reporting period policy, where applicable, or the issuing insurance company is unable or unwilling to pay such claims, we may be responsible for those losses. Furthermore, for our losses that are insured or reinsured through commercial insurance companies, we are subject to the \u201ccredit risk\u201d of those insurance companies. While we believe our commercial insurance company providers currently are creditworthy, there can be no assurance that such insurance companies will remain so in the future.\nCOVID-19 vaccination mandates adopted by federal, state, and local governments, as well as by certain healthcare systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOn September 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order requiring all employers with U.S. government contracts to ensure that their U.S.-based employees, contractors, and subcontractors that work on or in support of U.S. government contracts are fully vaccinated against COVID-19; the initial deadline for covered contractor employees to be fully vaccinated was December 8, 2021, but on November 4, 2021, the Biden administration extended this deadline to January 18, 2022. The executive order includes on-site and remote U.S.-based employees, contractors, and subcontractors and it only permits limited exceptions for medical and religious reasons. This executive order is currently tied up in litigation and is not currently being enforced.\nAdditionally, many state and local governments in which our business operates, as well as certain healthcare systems that serve as referral sources for Hanger Clinic patients, have implemented or announced COVID-19 vaccination requirements applicable to certain of our employees, and additional vaccination mandates may be announced in the future.\nIt is currently not possible to predict with certainty the impact any vaccination mandate will have on our business, especially on our workforce. These mandates could impact employers like us as well as health care providers with which we do business and who may require vendors and other health care professionals, such as our staff, to be vaccinated before coming on-site.\nOur implementation of these requirements may result in costs to us in the form of vaccinations or testing of employees. These requirements may also result in attrition in our workforce, including attrition of critically skilled employees, and difficulty securing future employment needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIII. Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nA cybersecurity incident could cause a violation of HIPAA and other privacy laws and regulations or result in a loss of confidential data.\nWe are not currently in full compliance with all the requirements of the regulations issued under HIPAA, and this could result in heightened cybersecurity risk. A cyber attack that penetrates our IT security defenses causing an IT security breach, loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws, loss of proprietary business information, or a material disruption of our IT business systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, our future results of operations, as well as our reputation, could be adversely impacted by theft, destruction, loss, or misappropriation of protected health information, other confidential data, or proprietary business information.\nOur acquisitions require transitions and integration of various information technology systems, and we regularly upgrade and expand our information technology systems\u2019 capabilities. If we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of these systems or are unable to implement, maintain, or expand our systems properly, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, regulatory problems, working capital disruptions, and increases in administrative expenses. While we make significant efforts to address any information security issues and vulnerabilities with respect to the companies we acquire, we may still inherit risks of security breaches or other compromises when we integrate these companies within our business.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, and local governmental regulations, noncompliance with which could result in significant penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA failure by us to comply with the numerous federal, state, and/or local health care and other governmental regulations to which we are subject, including the regulations discussed under \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d in \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS.\u201d above, could result in significant penalties and adverse consequences, including exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur non-compete agreements and other restrictive covenants involving clinicians may not be enforceable.\nWe have contracts with clinicians in many states. Some of these contracts include provisions preventing these clinicians from competing with us both during and after the term of our relationship with them. The law governing non-compete agreements and other forms of restrictive covenants varies from state to state. Some states are reluctant to strictly enforce non-compete agreements and restrictive covenants applicable to health care providers. There can be no assurance that our non-compete agreements related to affiliated clinicians will not be successfully challenged as unenforceable in certain states. In such event, we would be unable to prevent former affiliated clinicians from competing with us, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our patients, reducing our revenues and earnings.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business or to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including but not limited to our trademarks and copyrights, and our proprietary technology. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret, and other laws to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology, or to defend against claims by third parties that the conduct of our businesses or our use of intellectual property infringes upon such third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to pay substantial amounts to the other party or cease exercising our rights in such intellectual property, including ceasing the use of certain trademarks used by us to distinguish our services from those of others or ceasing the exercise of our rights in copyrightable works. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third-party\u2019s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected as a result.\nIV. Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Capital Structure\nWe have substantial indebtedness, and our failure to comply with the covenants and payment requirements of that indebtedness may subject us to increased interest expenses, lender consent and amendment costs, or adverse financial consequences.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $517.2 million in indebtedness. This current level of indebtedness is comprised of approximately $486.1 million of borrowings under the term loan facility under our Credit Agreement, no borrowings under the revolving credit facility of our Credit Agreement, and approximately $31.2 million of indebtedness related to other financing obligations and Seller Notes, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs. Under our Credit Agreement, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants and other provisions. In addition to other requirements, these provisions include requirements that we timely prepare our financial statements and timely receive audits on our annual financial statements, meet certain financial ratio requirements, and timely pay interest and principal when due. To the extent that we fail to meet our financial statement requirements in future periods, our operating trends do not enable us to meet our financial covenant requirements, we are unable to pay interest or principal when due or we are unable to meet other covenants and requirements contained within our currently existing Credit Agreement, we may default under the Credit Agreement. A default could result in increases in consent or amendment fees to lenders, increases in interest costs, the imposition of additional constraints on borrowing by our lenders, or potentially more serious liquidity constraints and adverse financial consequences, including reductions in the value of our common stock or the necessity of seeking protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws. See the \u201cFinancial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources\u201d section in this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\nAdditionally, our current Credit Agreement includes variable interest rates. In the event that interest rates rise, we will be required to pay greater interest expenses, which will have an adverse effect on our income from operations and financial condition.\nTo remedy issues we may encounter with meeting our debt obligations, or for other purposes, we may find it necessary to seek further refinancing of our indebtedness, and may do so with debt instruments that are more costly than our existing instruments (and which will rank senior to our equity securities), or we may issue additional equity securities which may dilute the ownership interests or value of our existing shareholders. These actions may decrease the value of our equity securities.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022industry or general market conditions;\n\u2022domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022changes in our referral sources\u2019 or customers\u2019 preferences;\n\u2022new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\u2022lawsuits, enforcement actions, and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022action by activist shareholders, institutional shareholders or other large shareholders, including future sales or purchases of our common stock;\n\u2022the entry of a new competitor into one of the markets we serve;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022investor perception of us and our industry;\n\u2022changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, or strategic partnerships;\n\u2022any future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022ability to file future SEC filings timely.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme volatility in recent years from a variety of reasons that have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, including geopolitical, social, healthcare, and other events impacting the global stock markets generally. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against such company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth, to develop our business, and to potentially fund future share repurchases. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which shareholders have purchased their shares.", "PERMNO": 10051, "SIC": 8093, "TIC": "HNGR"}
