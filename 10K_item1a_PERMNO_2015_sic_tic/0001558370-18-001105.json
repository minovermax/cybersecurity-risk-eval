{"cik": "1477425", "company": "SendGrid, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d, as well as our other public filings with the SEC. Our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and uncertainties. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. In addition, the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. Our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material, and these risks and uncertainties could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. In assessing the risks and uncertainties described below, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur recent growth may not be indicative of our future growth and, if we continue to grow, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\nWe have recently experienced a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations. In particular, we grew from 58 employees as of December 31, 2011, to 415 fulltime employees as of December 31, 2017, and we have also significantly increased the number of emails processed by our platform over the last several years. We anticipate that we will continue to expand our operations and headcount in the near term. Our growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, technical, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our management, technical, administrative, operational, and financial controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage our growth could result in difficulty or delays in effectively scaling our platform to handle increased email volumes, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties. Any of these difficulties could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to sustain our revenue growth rate, we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have experienced rapid revenue growth over recent years, with revenue of $111.9 million, $79.9 million, and $58.5 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Although we have experienced rapid revenue growth historically, we may not continue to grow as rapidly in the future and our revenue growth rates may decline. Any success that we may experience in the future will depend in large part on our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nmaintain and expand our customer base;\n\u00b7\nincrease revenue from existing customers through increased or broader use of our platform within their organizations;\n\u00b7\nimprove the performance and capabilities of our platform through research and development;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally;\n\u00b7\nachieve the anticipated benefits from any businesses or technologies that we may acquire; and\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully compete with other companies.\nIf we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, our stock price could be volatile or decline, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability. You should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual periods as any indication of our future revenue or revenue growth.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, retain existing customers or increase sales both to new and existing customers, our business and results of operations will be affected adversely.\nTo succeed, we must continue to attract and retain customers and increase sales to new and existing customers. We price our services on a tiered subscription model based on the customer\u2019s use of our services (principally, email volumes), and therefore the revenue we generate from our customers depends on their use of our services. We have only a limited salesforce and to date have relied primarily on our self-service model to generate our revenue. The amount that new and existing customers purchase, renew, and use our services depends on a number of factors, including those outside of our control.\nWe may fail to attract new customers, retain existing customers or increase sales to new or existing customers as a result of a number of factors, including: reductions in our current or potential customers\u2019 spending levels; competitive factors affecting the cloud-based business software market, including the introduction of competing platforms, discount pricing and other strategies that may be implemented by our competitors; our ability to execute on our growth strategy and operating plans; a decline in our customers\u2019 level of satisfaction with our platform and customers\u2019 usage of our platform or an increased perception by our customers\u2019 that they can manage their email distribution and marketing efforts internally or otherwise without use of our platform; reductions in the use of email as a digital communication channel; the difficulty and cost to switch to a competitor may not be significant for many of our customers; changes in our relationships with third parties, including our strategic partners and payment processors; the timeliness and success of new services and functionality we may offer now or in the future, including our Marketing Campaigns service that we introduced in late 2015; concerns relating to actual or perceived security breaches; the frequency and severity of any system outages; and technological changes or problems. In addition, we believe a relatively small number of businesses have more than one unique paying account with us, and we count each of these accounts as a separate customer. We believe our number of customers is an important measure for evaluating our business. Because some businesses have more than one unique paying account with us and we count each of these accounts as a separate customer, the number of our customers set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for any period is not necessarily indicative of the number of unique businesses from which we received revenue during any such period. We rely on our reputation and recommendations from key customers in order to promote our platform. The loss of any of our key customers could have a significant impact on our business reputation and our ability to obtain new customers. In addition, acquisitions of our customers could lead to cancellation of our contracts with those customers or by the acquiring companies.\nFailure to attract new customers, retain existing customers or increase sales to customers will harm our business and results of operations.\nOur limited operating history in new and developing markets and our rapid growth make it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects.\nWe introduced our Email API service in 2009, our Marketing Campaigns service in late 2015, and our Expert Services in 2016. The majority of our revenue growth has occurred in the last few years and was derived from the sale of subscriptions to our Email API service. This short operating history and our rapid growth make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our ability to forecast our future operating results is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth, particularly with respect to our most recently introduced services. If our assumptions regarding these uncertainties are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our historical and expected operating and financial results, our business could suffer, and the trading price of our stock may decline.\nWe also operate in new and developing markets that may not continue to develop as we expect. You should consider our future prospects in light of the challenges and uncertainties that we face, including the fact that our business has grown rapidly, and it may not be possible to discern fully the trends that we are subject to, that we operate in new and developing markets and that elements of our business strategy are new and subject to ongoing development. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including increasing and unforeseen expenses as we continue to grow our business. If we do not manage these risks successfully, our business and results of operations will be harmed.\nIf we are unable to increase adoption of our platform through our self-service model, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nHistorically, we have relied on the adoption of our platform through our self-service model for a significant majority of our revenue. We have only a limited salesforce. Although we believe our business model can continue to scale without a significantly larger salesforce, our self-service model may not continue to be as effective as we anticipate, and the absence of a large direct sales function may impede our future growth.\nAs we continue to scale our business, we may choose to invest in a larger direct salesforce to reach additional customers and grow our revenue. Our ability to manage a larger direct salesforce is uncertain. Identifying and recruiting additional qualified sales personnel and managing and training them once hired would require significant time, expense and attention and would significantly impact our business model. In addition, adding additional salesforce would considerably change our cost structure and results of operations, and we may have to reduce other expenses, such as our research and development expense, in order to accommodate a corresponding increase in marketing and sales expense and attain and maintain profitability. If our lack of a large direct salesforce limits us from reaching additional customers and growing our revenue and we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel in the future, our revenue growth and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties to sell our services.\nWe have established strategic relationships with a number of other companies, including public cloud infrastructure providers and ecommerce platforms, software vendors that offer complementary products and with which we co-sell our services and digital marketing agencies that resell our services to their clients. In order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will continue to establish and maintain these strategic relationships. Identifying strategic partners, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services over ours or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our platform. In addition, acquisitions of our strategic partners by our competitors, or acquisition of our competitors by our strategic partners, could result in a decrease in the number of our current and potential customers, as our strategic partners may no longer facilitate the adoption of our platform by potential customers.\nIf we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our strategic relationships with third parties, our ability to compete or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our operating results could suffer. Even if we are successful in our strategic relationships, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased usage of our services or increased revenues.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to continue to drive adoption of our platform and services by international customers, and our international operations and sales to customers with international operations expose us to risks inherent in international sales.\nWe generated more than 36% of our revenue in each of the last three years from customers located outside the United States. The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to expand our customer base worldwide and to sell additional services to international customers.\nIf we are unable to successfully market our platform to or localize our services for international customers, then our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected, and our growth may be constrained.\nWe have limited experience operating in international markets where the challenges of conducting our business can be significantly different from those we have faced in the United States and the existing markets in which we operate and where business practices may create internal control risks. We have only recently established operations outside of the United States, with the opening of an office in London. We may open additional non-U.S. offices in the future. There are a number of risks inherent in conducting international business, including:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nthe burden of complying with a wide variety of laws and regulatory regimes, including those relating to labor matters, consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, and taxes;\n\u00b7\ntariffs, export and import restrictions, restrictions on foreign investments, sanctions, and other trade barriers or protection measures;\n\u00b7\ncosts and difficulties of localizing our services;\n\u00b7\nlack of acceptance of our localized services;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in and costs of staffing, managing, and operating our international operations;\n\u00b7\ntax issues, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and with respect to our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements;\n\u00b7\nweaker intellectual property protection;\n\u00b7\neconomic weakness or currency related crises;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on the ability of our self-service sales model to attract international customers;\n\u00b7\nour limited historical sale experience outside the United States;\n\u00b7\nour ability to adapt to our marketing and selling efforts to different cultures and customer requirements;\n\u00b7\ncommon local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our policies and codes of conduct and ethics;\n\u00b7\ncorporate espionage; and\n\u00b7\npolitical instability and security risks in the countries where we are doing business.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage these risks, our relationships with our existing and prospective customers, strategic partners and employees and our operations outside of the United States may be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand and maintain and increase market awareness of our company and services, then our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing the \u201cSendGrid\u201d brand identity and maintaining and increasing market awareness of our company and services is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our platform, to strengthen our relationships with our existing customers and to our ability to attract new customers. The successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on our continued marketing efforts, our ability to continue to offer high quality services, our ability to be thought leaders in our industry and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform and services from competing products and services. For example, we rely on both algorithmic and purchased listings displayed by search engines to attract a significant percentage of the customers. Algorithmic listings cannot be purchased, and instead are determined and displayed solely by a set of formulas designed by the search engine. Purchased listings can be purchased by advertisers in order to attract customers to their websites, but the cost of purchased search listing advertising may increase as demand for these channels grows. If search engines on which we rely for algorithmic listings modify their algorithms in an attempt to optimize their search listings, this could result in fewer potential customers clicking through to our website, requiring us to resort to additional purchased listings or other costly advertisements to attempt to replace this traffic. If one or more search engines on which we rely for purchased listings modifies or terminates its relationship with us, or increases the amounts it charges us, our expenses could rise. Any such increases could negatively affect market awareness of our brand and our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, independent industry analysts often provide reviews of our services and competing products and services, which may significantly influence the perception of our services in the marketplace. If these reviews are negative or not\nas strong as reviews of our competitors\u2019 products and services, then our brand may be harmed. This may cause us to lose existing customers, decrease the number of new customers that we are able to attract or lower our pricing model, each of which would likely harm our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, our customers and other third parties have complained about our platform, such as complaints about our pricing and customer support or the use of our platform to transmit spam, phishing scams, website links to harmful applications or other harmful or illegal material. If we do not handle customer and other complaints effectively, then our brand and reputation may suffer, our customers may lose confidence in us and our customers may reduce or cease their use of our services. In addition, many of our customers post about and discuss Internet-based products and services, including our platform and services, on social media. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to generate positive customer feedback and minimize negative feedback on social media channels where existing and potential customers seek and share information. If actions we take or changes we make to our platform or services, particularly as our platform continues to scale, upset these customers then their online commentary could negatively affect our brand and reputation. Complaints or negative publicity about us, our platform or our services could materially and adversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers, our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe promotion of our brand also requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that these expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive and as we expand into new markets. To the extent that these activities increase revenue, this revenue still may not be enough to offset the increased expenses we incur. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, then our business may not grow, we may see our pricing power reduced relative to competitors and we may lose customers, all of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe market in which we participate is highly competitive and, if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nWe provide cloud-based services that enable businesses to reach their customers using email for both transactional and marketing purposes. The market for providing these services is fragmented, with some vendors addressing transactional email services, some vendors addressing email marketing services and other vendors providing a broad array of services that include transactional and marketing services as part of a software suite or broader portfolio of software offerings. Notwithstanding the availability of third-party software services, some businesses rely on internally-developed solutions for their email communications needs. The market for digital communications services is rapidly evolving, creating opportunity for new competitors to enter the market with point product solutions or addressing specific segments of the market. In addition, in some instances, we have strategic or other commercial relationships with companies with which we also compete, such as Amazon Web Services. Our competitors include:\n\u00b7\nCompanies that offer transactional email services, including Amazon, Mailgun, Oracle and SparkPost; and\n\u00b7\nCompanies that offer email marketing services, including Adobe, Campaign Monitor, Endurance, IBM, MailChimp, Oracle and Salesforce.\nWe believe the principal factors on which we compete include: completeness of offering; credibility with developers and marketers; global reach; ease of adoption; features and functionality; platform scalability, reliability, security, and performance; brand awareness and reputation; integration with third-party applications and data sources; customer support; and the total cost of deployment and ownership. Our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies with similar or superior functionality to our platform or at a cheaper price point that render our existing or future services less competitive or obsolete, and we may need to decrease the prices or accept less favorable terms for subscriptions for our services in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to maintain our pricing due to competitive pressures, our margins will be reduced, and our operating results will be negatively affected.\nOur current and potential competitors also may have significantly more financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we have, may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services, may have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships and may have longer operating histories and greater name recognition. As a result, these competitors may respond faster to new technologies and undertake more extensive marketing programs for their products or services. If these companies decide to further invest in\nand develop, market, or resell competitive products or services, or acquire or form a strategic alliance with one of our other competitors, our ability to compete effectively could be significantly compromised and our operating results could be harmed. In a few cases, these vendors may offer competitive products or services at little or no additional cost by bundling it with their existing suite of applications. To the extent any of our competitors has existing relationships with potential customers for either email software or other applications, those customers may be unwilling to purchase our platform because of their existing relationships with our competitor. If we are unable to compete with such companies, the demand for our platform and services could substantially decline.\nIf our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to our or our customers\u2019 and their end customers\u2019 private or proprietary data is otherwise obtained, our platform or services may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be severely harmed, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our services, we may incur significant liabilities and we may lose the ability to offer our customers a credit card payment option.\nOur operations involve the storage and transmission of data of our customers and their end customers, including personally identifiable information. Security breaches or other incidents could result in unauthorized access to, loss of or unauthorized disclosure of this information, litigation, indemnity obligations and other possible liabilities, as well as negative publicity, which could damage our reputation, impair our sales, and harm our customers and our business. Cyberattacks and other malicious Internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and cloud-based service providers like us are regularly targeted. For example, in 2013, we suffered a distributed denial of service attack, whereby a cybercriminal denied our customers access to our webpage and, in 2015, a cybercriminal gained unauthorized access to several of our internal systems, including those containing sensitive and confidential customer data. It is possible that we may face increased risk of cybersecurity attacks as compromising our platform may allow cybercriminals to send a large number of phishing emails that bypasses end users\u2019 spam filters. If our security measures are compromised as a result of third-party action, employee or customer error, malfeasance, stolen or fraudulently obtained log-in credentials or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged, our business may be harmed, and we could incur significant liability. In addition, if the security measures of our customers are compromised, even without any actual compromise of our own systems, we may face negative publicity or reputational harm if our customers or anyone else incorrectly attributes the blame for such security breaches to us or our systems. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage our systems because they change frequently and generally are not detected until after an incident has occurred. As we increase our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems or gain unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data. Further, as we rely more on third-party and public-cloud infrastructure, such as Amazon Web Services, we will become more dependent on third-party security measures to protect against unauthorized access, cyberattacks and the mishandling of customer data. Any security breach, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputation, and we could lose customers and fail to acquire new customers. In addition, many governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data and any mandatory disclosures we may make regarding a security breach would likely lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. It is also possible that security breaches sustained by our competitors could result in negative publicity for our entire industry that indirectly harms our reputation and diminishes demand for our services.\nFurthermore, failure to maintain compliance with the data protection policy standards adopted by the major credit card issuers and other payment processors may limit our ability to offer our customers a credit card or online payment option. Any loss of our ability to offer our customers a credit card payment or online payment option would harm our reputation and make our platform and services less attractive to many organizations by negatively impacting our customer experience and significantly increasing our administrative costs related to customer payment processing.\nOur existing general liability insurance may not cover any, or cover only a portion of any, potential claims related to security breaches to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all or any portion of liabilities that may be imposed. In addition, there can be no assurance that the limitations on liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities with respect to any particular claim. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage would increase our operating expenses and reduce our net income.\nOur customers\u2019 and other users\u2019 violation of our policies or other misuse of our platform to transmit offensive or illegal messages, phish, spam, website links to harmful applications or for other fraudulent activity could damage our reputation, and we may face liability for unauthorized, inaccurate, or fraudulent information distributed via our platform.\nDespite our ongoing and substantial efforts to limit such use, a portion of our customers use our platform to transmit offensive or illegal messages, spam, phishing scams, and website links to harmful applications, reproduce and distribute copyrighted material or the trademarks of others without permission, and report inaccurate or fraudulent data or information. These issues also arise with respect to a portion of those users who use our platform on a free trial basis. These actions are in violation of our policies. However, our efforts to defeat spamming attacks and other fraudulent activity will not prevent all such attacks and activity, such use of our platform could damage our reputation and we could face claims for damages, copyright or trademark infringement, defamation, negligence, or fraud. Moreover, our customers\u2019 and other users\u2019 promotion of their products and services through our platform might not comply with federal, state, and foreign laws. We rely on contractual representations made to us by our customers that their use of our platform will comply with our policies and applicable law, including, without limitation, our email policy. Although we retain the right to verify that customers and other users are abiding by our email policy and to review their email and email lists, our customers and other users are ultimately responsible for compliance with our policies, and we do not systematically audit our customers or other users to confirm compliance with our policies. We cannot predict whether our role in facilitating our customers\u2019 or other users\u2019 activities would expose us to liability under applicable law. Even if claims asserted against us do not result in liability, we may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims. If we are found liable for our customers\u2019 or other users\u2019 activities, we could be required to pay fines or penalties, redesign business methods or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions and to avoid future liability.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our software could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nOur platform is complex, and therefore, undetected errors, failures or bugs may occur, particularly as we continue to scale our platform to accommodate future growth. Our platform may be used in IT environments with different operating systems, system management software, applications, devices, databases and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures of our platform or other aspects of the IT environment into which it is deployed. Despite testing by us, errors, failures, or bugs may not be found until our platform is used by our customers. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our platform or services could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our platform or services, weakening of our competitive position, claims by customers for losses sustained by them or failure to meet any stated service level commitments in our customer agreements. For example, in November 2017, while making changes to increase stability in our system, a subset of recipient data was relocated within one of our data centers. During the relocation, this subset of recipient data did not fully propagate for some customer accounts, resulting in the decision to suspend Marketing Campaigns email sending for several hours until recipient data was restored. Correcting any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions, delays, or cessation in the sale of our services, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur platform and services and our business are subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those regarding privacy, data protection and information security. Any failure by us or our third-party service providers, as well as the failure of our platform or services to comply with applicable laws and regulations would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various federal government agencies, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and state and local agencies. The United States and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security, and storage of personally identifiable information of individuals, and the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the online collection, use and dissemination of data. Self-regulatory obligations, other industry standards, policies and other legal obligations may apply to our collection, distribution, use, security or storage of personally identifiable information or other data relating to individuals. In addition, the federal government and many states and foreign governments have enacted laws requiring companies to\nnotify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with one another, other regulatory requirements, or our internal practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with United States, European Union or other foreign privacy or security laws, regulations, policies, industry standards or legal obligations or any security incident that results in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of, personally identifiable information or other customer data may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nWe expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the European Union, and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. For example, in May 2018, the general data protection regulation will come into force, bringing with it a complete overhaul of E.U. data protection laws: the new rules will supersede current E.U. data protection legislation, impose more stringent E.U. data protection requirements, and provide for greater penalties for noncompliance. Changing definitions of personal data and information may also limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data. Also, some jurisdictions require that certain types of data be retained on servers within these jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, directives and regulations may result in enforcement action against us, including fines and imprisonment, and damage to our reputation, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. In 2016, the European Union and the United States political authorities adopted the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, or Privacy Shield, to enable companies in the United States to transfer personal data lawfully from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. Organizations in the United States may participate in the Privacy Shield program once they have satisfied a series of requirements (as contained in a set of privacy-protective principles), which are designed to ensure they will continue to provide a level of data protection deemed \u201cadequate\u201d by the European Commission. The Privacy Shield is administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission. In December 2017, we obtained our E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield certification and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield certification. By submitting our self-certifications to these Privacy Shield frameworks, we have committed to apply the frameworks\u2019 principles to all personal information received by us from the European Economic Area and Switzerland in reliance on these frameworks. These frameworks enable us to lawfully collect, receive and process personal data from the European Union and Switzerland.\nWe publicly post our privacy policies and practices concerning our processing, use and disclosure of the personally identifiable information provided to us by our website visitors. Our publication of our privacy policies and other statements we publish that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive or misrepresentative of our practices.\nIf our service is perceived to cause, or is otherwise unfavorably associated with, violations of privacy or data security requirements, it may subject us or our customers to public criticism and potential legal liability. Existing and potential privacy laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security and increasing sensitivity of consumers to unauthorized processing of personal information may create negative public reactions to technologies, products, and services such as ours. Public concerns regarding personal information processing, privacy and security may cause some of our customers\u2019 end users to be less likely to visit their websites or otherwise interact with them. If enough end users choose not to visit our customers\u2019 websites or otherwise interact with them, our customers could stop using our platform. This, in turn, may reduce the value of our services and slow or eliminate the growth of our business.\nEvolving and changing definitions of what constitutes \u201cPersonal Information\u201d and \u201cPersonal Data\u201d within the European Union, the United States and elsewhere, especially relating to the classification of internet protocol, or IP, addresses, machine or device identification numbers, location data and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business. Future laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations could impair our ability to collect or use information that we utilize to provide email delivery and marketing services to our customers, thereby impairing our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase revenue. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of our customers\u2019 data or additional requirements for express or implied consent of customers for the use and disclosure of such information limit our ability to develop new services and features.\nUnited States federal legislation and the laws of many foreign countries impose certain obligations on the senders of commercial emails, which could minimize the effectiveness of our platform, and establish financial penalties for non-compliance, which could increase the costs of our business.\nThe Federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or the CAN-SPAM Act, establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and transactional email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. The CAN-SPAM Act, among other things, obligates the sender of commercial emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future commercial emails from the sender. In addition, some states have passed laws regulating commercial email practices that are significantly more restrictive and difficult to comply with than the CAN-SPAM Act. For example, Utah and Michigan prohibit the sending of email messages that advertise products or services that minors are prohibited by law from purchasing (e.g., alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, illegal drugs) or that contain content harmful to minors (e.g., pornography) to email addresses listed on specified child protection registries. Some portions of these state laws may not be preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada, and the European Union, have enacted laws that regulate sending email, and some of these laws are more restrictive than U.S. laws. For example, some foreign laws prohibit sending broad categories of email unless the recipient has provided the sender advance consent to receipt of such email, or in other words has \u201copted-in\u201d to receiving such email. If we were found to be in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, applicable state laws governing email not preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act or foreign laws regulating the distribution of email, whether as a result of violations by our customers or our own acts or omissions, we could be required to pay large penalties, which would adversely affect our financial condition, significantly harm our business, and injure our reputation. The terms of injunctions, judgments, consent decrees or settlement agreements entered into connection with enforcement actions or investigations against our company in connection with any of the foregoing laws may also require us to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business, which could impair our ability to attract and retain customers or could increase our operating costs.\nThe standards that private entities and inbox service providers use to regulate the use and delivery of email have in the past interfered with, and may in the future interfere with, the effectiveness of our platform and our ability to conduct business.\nOur customers rely on email to communicate with their existing or prospective customers. Various private entities attempt to regulate the use of email for commercial solicitation. These entities often advocate standards of conduct or practice that significantly exceed current legal requirements and classify certain email solicitations that comply with current legal requirements as spam. Some of these entities maintain \u201cblacklists\u201d of companies and individuals, and the websites, inbox service providers and IP addresses associated with those entities or individuals that do not adhere to those standards of conduct or practices for commercial email solicitations that the blacklisting entity believes are appropriate. If a company\u2019s IP addresses are listed by a blacklisting entity, emails sent from those addresses may be blocked if they are sent to any internet domain or internet address that subscribes to the blacklisting entity\u2019s service or uses its blacklist.\nFrom time to time, some of our IP addresses have become, and we expect will continue to be, listed with one or more blacklisting entities due to the messaging practices of our customers and other users. We may be at an increased risk of having our IP addresses blacklisted due to our scale and volume of email processed, compared to our smaller competitors. While the overall percentage of such email solicitations that our individual customers send may be at or below reasonable standards, the total aggregate number of all emails that we process on behalf of our customers may trigger increased scrutiny from these blacklisting entities. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully remove ourselves from those lists. Because we fulfill email delivery on behalf of our customers, blacklisting of this type could undermine the effectiveness of our customers\u2019 transactional email, email marketing programs and other email communications, all of which could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, inbox service providers can block emails from reaching their users. While we continually improve our own technology and work closely with inbox service providers to maintain our deliverability rates, the implementation of new or more restrictive policies by inbox service providers may make it more difficult to deliver our customers\u2019 emails, particularly if we are not given adequate notice of a change in policy or struggle to update our platform or services to comply with the changed policy in a reasonable amount of time. In addition, some inbox service providers categorize as \u201cpromotional\u201d emails that originate from email service providers and, as a result, direct them to an alternate or \u201ctabbed\u201d\nsection of the recipient\u2019s inbox. If inbox service providers materially limit or halt the delivery of our customers\u2019 emails, or if we fail to deliver our customers\u2019 emails in a manner compatible with inbox service providers\u2019 email handling or authentication technologies or other policies, or if the open rates of our customers\u2019 emails are negatively impacted by the actions of inbox service providers to categorize emails, then customers may question the effectiveness of our platform and cancel their accounts. This, in turn, would harm our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions and anti-corruption laws and regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nVarious of our operations and services may be subject to export control and economic sanctions regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. The provision of our services must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular deployment may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. In addition, changes in our platform capabilities or services, or changes in applicable export or economic sanctions regulations may create delays in the introduction and deployment of our platform and services in international markets, or, in some cases, prevent the provision of our services to certain countries or end users. Any change in export or economic sanctions regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could also result in decreased use of our platform and services, or in our decreased ability to provide our services to existing or prospective customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform and services or limitation on our ability to provide our services could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFurthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the exportation of certain products and services to countries, territories, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. While we are currently taking precautions to prevent our platform from being accessed by persons targeted by U.S. sanctions, including IP address blocking, such measures may be circumvented. Given the technical limitations in developing measures that will prevent access to internet based services from particular geographies or by particular individuals, we have previously identified and expect we will continue to identify customer accounts for our platform and services that originate or that we suspect originate from countries that are subject to U.S. embargoes.\nWe are aware that trials of and subscriptions to our platform have been initiated by persons and organizations in countries that are the subject of U.S. embargoes. Our provision of services in these instances was likely in violation of trade sanctions laws. We have terminated the accounts of such persons and organizations as we have become aware of them. We filed an initial voluntary self-disclosure with the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, in February 2016 concerning these potential violations. In December 2017, OFAC informed us it had completed its review of our voluntary self-disclosure and issued a cautionary letter instead of pursuing a civil monetary penalty. The cautionary letter is a final enforcement response but does not constitute a final agency determination and does not preclude OFAC from taking future enforcement action should new or additional information warrant renewed attention.\nOur failure to comply with U.S. sanctions or export control laws or regulations could cause us and certain of our employees to be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Each instance in which we allow access to our platform may constitute a separate violation of these laws. We may also suffer reputational harm.\nFurther, we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our platform functions and services. Various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our customers\u2019 ability to import our services into those countries. Encryption products and the underlying technology may also be subject to export control restrictions. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of exports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required approval for our services, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the provision of our services, including with respect to new services, may create delays in the introduction of our services in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from\ndeploying our platform and using our services throughout their globally-distributed systems or, in some cases, prevent the provision of our services to some countries altogether.\nAdditionally, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions both domestic and abroad. We and our third-party business partners and intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures in place to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results, and prospects.\nIf we are unable to develop and release enhancements to our platform and services or new services and functionality to respond to rapid technological change in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe market for our platform and services is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements, changing customer demands, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies can quickly make existing products and services obsolete and unmarketable. For example, new Internet standards and technologies or new standards in the field of operating system support could emerge that are incompatible with customer deployments of our platform. The success of any enhancements or improvements to our platform or any new services or functionality depends on several factors, including timely completion, competitive pricing, adequate quality testing, integration with existing technologies and our platform, and overall market acceptance. We cannot be sure that we will succeed in developing, marketing, and delivering on a timely and cost-effective basis enhancements or improvements to our platform or any services or functionality that respond to technological change or new customer requirements, nor can we be sure that any enhancements or improvements to our platform will achieve market acceptance. For example, we introduced our Marketing Campaigns service in late 2015 and the service may not achieve broad market acceptance or be cost-effective in the long term.\nFurther, our success depends on meeting customer demands and expectations both with respect to the ability of our API to integrate within their applications and the speed, reliability, and effectiveness of our platform. For example, if we are unable to adapt our platform on a timely basis to new email or operating system protocols or we fail to effectively integrate our API with new technologies and standards, the ability of our platform to integrate with our customers\u2019 systems or satisfy our customers\u2019 needs may be impaired. In addition, because we use both co-located data centers and public cloud resources to host our platform, we need to continually enhance and improve our platform to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communications, and database technologies and standards. As we transition to Amazon Web Services to host a portion of our platform, we will become more dependent on third parties to keep pace with such changes. If we cannot deliver technologically competitive services, we could lose customers and our revenues and stock price may decline.\nAny new services or functionality that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain errors or defects, or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate sufficient revenue. Moreover, even if we introduce new services or functionality, we may experience a decline in revenue of our existing services that is not offset by revenue from the new services or functionality. For example, customers may delay making purchases of new services to permit them to make a more thorough evaluation of these services or until industry and marketplace reviews become widely available. In addition, we may lose existing customers that choose a competitor\u2019s products and services or that choose to rely on an internally-developed solution, rather than migrate to our new services. Similarly, if we offer a bundle of our services that our customers and prospective customers do not find compelling, our business will be harmed. This could result in a temporary or permanent revenue shortfall and adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to scale our technology infrastructure and platform quickly enough to meet our customers\u2019 growing needs and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed.\nAs usage of our platform grows, we will need to continue making significant investments to develop and implement new technologies in our infrastructure operations to support our growth. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including basic customer support and our Expert Services team, to serve our growing customer base. Any failure of, or delay in, these efforts could impair the performance of our platform and reduce customer satisfaction and reduce our growth. Even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion may be expensive and complex. To the extent that we do not effectively scale our platform and infrastructure to meet the growing needs of our customers or are not able to manage that growth effectively, we may not be able to grow as quickly as we anticipate, our customers may reduce or stop use of our services, we may be unable to compete effectively, and our business and operating results may be harmed.\nWe are primarily dependent on a single service, our Email API service, and the lack of continued market acceptance of our Email API service could cause our operating results to suffer.\nSales of our Email API service account for a substantial majority of our revenue. We expect that we will be substantially dependent on our Email API service to generate revenue for the foreseeable future. As a result, our operating results could suffer due to:\n\u00b7\nany decline in demand for our Email API service;\n\u00b7\nthe failure of our Email API service to achieve continued market acceptance;\n\u00b7\nthe market for our Email API service not continuing to grow, or growing more slowly than we expect;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction or increase in popularity of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for, or represent an improvement over, our Email API service;\n\u00b7\ntechnological innovations or new standards that our Email API service does not address;\n\u00b7\nsensitivity to current or future prices offered by us or competing solutions;\n\u00b7\nour inability to release enhanced versions of our Email API service on a timely basis; and\n\u00b7\nthe continued use and ubiquity of email in commercial transactions and applications.\nIf the market for our Email API service grows more slowly than anticipated or if demand for our Email API service does not grow as quickly as anticipated, we may not be able to grow our revenue.\nOur services are sold on a short-term basis, such that subscription renewal or usage rates can decrease rapidly, and if we do not accurately predict these rates, our future revenue and operating results may be harmed.\nWe charge our customers based on their use of our services. We generally enter into monthly subscription agreements with our customers and, therefore, most of our customers may reduce or cease their use of our services on a monthly basis without penalty or termination charges. Our retention of customers and our customers\u2019 use of our services are used to determine our subscription net dollar retention rate. We believe subscription net dollar retention rate is an important measure for evaluating our business. Additionally, our subscription agreements for use of our Email API service include a fixed fee that covers a specified number of email credits in the applicable month. If our customers lower the number of email credits they purchase in any month, then the fixed fees we charge will decrease. We have historically experienced customer turnover as a result of many of our customers being SMBs in the entrepreneurial stage of their development that are more susceptible than larger businesses to general economic conditions and other risks affecting their businesses. We cannot accurately predict customers\u2019 usage levels on a monthly basis and the loss of customers or reductions in their usage levels of our services may each have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition,\nincluding our subscription net dollar retention rate and our subscription gross dollar churn rate, which is a component of our subscription net dollar retention rate.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with our customers and have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.\nOur customers depend on our customer support team to resolve technical and operational issues relating to our platform. Our ability to provide effective customer support is largely dependent on our ability to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel with experience in supporting customers on platforms such as ours. Our customer base has grown significantly and that has and will put additional pressure on our customer support team. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support. We also may be unable to modify the scope and delivery of our support to compete with changes in the support provided by our competitors. Increased customer demand for support, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and negatively affect our operating results. In addition, as we continue to grow our operations and expand internationally, we need to be able to provide efficient customer support that meets our customers\u2019 needs globally at scale and our customer support team will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support and documentation in languages other than English. If we are unable to provide efficient customer support globally at scale, our ability to grow our operations may be harmed and we may need to hire additional support personnel, which could negatively impact our operating results. In addition, we provide self-service support resources to our customers, such as our best practice guides and webcasts hosted on our website. We also rely on our user community to serve as a resource for questions on any part of our platform. Members of our user community are not obligated to participate in discussions with other users, and to the extent they do not our customers\u2019 ability to find answers to questions about our platform of services may suffer. If we are unable to develop self-service support resources that are easy to use and that our customers utilize to resolve their technical issues or if our customers choose not to take advantage of these self-service support services, customers may continue to direct support requests to our customer support team instead of relying on our self-service support resources and our customers\u2019 experience with our platform may be negatively impacted. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation, our ability to sell our services to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nTo deliver our services, we rely on internet service providers for network connectivity and co-location facilities and public cloud infrastructure to host our platform.\nWe interconnect with internet service providers around the world to enable the use of our platform by our customers and we expect that we will continue to rely heavily on internet service providers for network connectivity going forward. Our reliance on internet service providers reduces our control over quality of service and exposes us to potential service outages and rate fluctuations. If a significant portion of our internet service providers stop providing us with access to their network infrastructure, fail to provide access on a cost-effective basis, cease operations, or otherwise terminate access, the delay caused by qualifying and switching to other internet service providers could be time consuming and costly and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, we currently serve the majority of our platform infrastructure from multiple co-located third-party data centers located throughout the United States and in certain international locations. We are in the process of transitioning the hosting of a portion of our platform infrastructure to Amazon Web Services. As a result, our operations depend, in part, on the ability of third parties to protect these facilities and resources against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or network failures, criminal acts and similar events. In the event that any of our hosting arrangements are terminated, or if there is a lapse of service or damage to a facility or other resource, we could experience interruptions in our platform as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and resources. We have experienced and expect that we will in the future experience such interruptions from time to time.\nAny damage to, or failure of, the systems of our third-party providers could result in interruptions to and may cause errors or poor quality communications with our platform. Even with current and planned disaster recovery arrangements, our business could be harmed. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenue, subject us to liability, damage our reputation and cause customers to become dissatisfied and fail to renew their subscriptions or demand credits, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business will suffer.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. From time to time we have experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining employees who have appropriate qualifications, and we are continuing our efforts to meet our hiring goals. We believe that there is, and will continue to be, intense competition for highly skilled executive, technical, marketing, and other personnel with experience in the locations where we maintain offices. We must provide competitive compensation packages and a high-quality work environment to hire, retain and motivate employees. If we are unable to retain and motivate our existing employees and attract qualified personnel to fill key positions, we may be unable to manage our business effectively, including the development, marketing, and sale of our services, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. To the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we also may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information.\nVolatility in, or lack of performance of, our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Many of our key personnel are, or will soon be, vested in a substantial amount of shares of common stock or stock awards. Employees may be more likely to terminate their employment with us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options, or, conversely, if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly above the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, if our stock price underperforms or the outlook for our stock is negative, we may not be able to attract qualified personnel to join our business. Candidates making employment decisions, particularly in high-technology industries, often consider the value and growth potential of any equity they may receive in connection with their employment. As a result, any significant decline in the market price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain highly skilled executive, technical, marketing, and other personnel. If we are unable to retain and attract highly-skilled employees, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced losses in the past, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe generated net losses of $6.3 million, $3.9 million, and $5.9 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $49.9 million. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods in order to achieve or sustain profitability. We also expect our costs to increase in future periods, which could negatively affect our future operating results if our revenue does not increase commensurately. For example, we intend to continue to expend significant funds to develop and enhance our technical infrastructure, platform, and services, including possibly through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies, expand our research and development efforts and selling and marketing operations, including through increased headcount, meet the increased compliance requirements associated with our transition to and operation as a public company, and expand into new markets. Our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our stock price may significantly decrease.\nWe may require additional financing in the future and may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could slow or stop our ability to grow or otherwise harm our business.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges and opportunities, including the need to develop new features or enhance our platform, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through our operations, sales of our equity securities and debt financing provided by financial institutions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. We may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock could decline. If we engage in debt financing, the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of our common stock, and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and our ability to operate our business. We may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders and force us to maintain specified\nliquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price could decline substantially.\nOur results of operations, including our revenue, operating expenses, and cash flows, have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, may be difficult to predict and may or may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Additionally, we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. Some of the factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n\u00b7\nour ability to attract new customers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain customers and expand their usage of our services;\n\u00b7\nchanges in customers\u2019 budgets and in the timing of their purchasing decisions, including as a result of any changes in their usage or expected usage of our services;\n\u00b7\npotential customers opting for alternative solutions, including internally-developed and maintained solutions, and competitive email or digital communication solutions;\n\u00b7\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and success of new products, features and services by us and our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including price competition or consolidation among competitors, customers, or strategic partners;\n\u00b7\nsignificant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our platform;\n\u00b7\nreputational harm or other liabilities resulting from the use of our platform to transmit spam, phishing scams, website links to harmful applications or other harmful or illegal material;\n\u00b7\nthe collectability of receivables from customers, which may be hindered or delayed if these customers experience financial distress;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers participate;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could, for example, cause our subscription agreements denominated in U.S. dollars to be more expensive internationally;\n\u00b7\nsales tax and other tax determinations by authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements; and\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in stock-based compensation expense.\nThe occurrence of one or more of the foregoing and other factors may cause our results of operations to vary significantly. Accordingly, our results of operations in any one quarter may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. Additionally, if our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or\nsecurities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our common stock could decline substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nOur revenue is affected by seasonality.\nOur revenue is directly correlated with the number of emails sent by our customers. During the fourth-quarter holiday season, our customers process a relatively higher number of transactions, run a greater number of marketing programs, and therefore send more emails. Partially because of this seasonality, a greater percentage of our annual revenue has come from our fourth quarter than from other quarters. In 2017, 2016, and 2015, 28% to 29% of our annual revenue was in our fourth quarter. While we believe that this seasonality has affected and will continue to affect our quarterly results, our rapid growth has largely masked seasonal trends to date. Seasonality may become more pronounced in the future to the extent our revenue mix shifts between our Email API, Marketing Campaigns, and other revenue sources over time. As a result, historical patterns in our business may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance.\nOur reliance on cloud-based technologies from third parties may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe rely heavily on hosted cloud-based technologies from third parties in order to operate critical internal functions of our business, including our accounting, billing, and office management functions. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions, or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices, our expenses could increase. As a result, our ability to manage our operations could be interrupted and our processes for managing our sales process and supporting our customers could be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained, and implemented, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture, which could harm our business.\nWe believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. Between December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2017, we have increased the size of our full-time workforce by 357 employees, and we expect to continue to hire as we expand. If we do not continue to maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we may be unable to foster the innovation, creativity, and teamwork we believe we need to support our growth. Moreover, many of our employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our common stock in the public markets after our recent initial public offering, or IPO, which could lead to disparities of wealth among our employees that adversely affects relations among employees and our culture in general. Our potential headcount growth and our transition from a private company to a public company may result in a change to our corporate culture, which could harm our business.\nAcquisition opportunities could be difficult to identify, and any pursued acquisitions could divert the attention of management, pose integration challenges, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have in the past acquired and intend in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, in 2017, we acquired Bizzy, a marketing automation company. We do not know if we will be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits of this or other acquisitions and we may not be successful in integrating acquired technologies and businesses into our company. Acquisitions may disrupt our business, divert our resources, and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our existing business.\nWe also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from an acquired business due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\ninability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated costs, accounting charges or other liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nincurrence of acquisition-related costs;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations, and personnel of the acquired business, including due to language, geographical or cultural differences;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto our platform and contract terms, including disparities in the revenues, licensing, support, or professional services model of the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nadverse effects to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nthe potential loss of key employees;\n\u00b7\nretention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nuse of resources that are needed in other parts of our business;\n\u00b7\nlitigation or other claims arising in connection with the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nadditional regulatory and compliance requirements; and\n\u00b7\nuse of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur platform or services may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties and this may create liability for us or otherwise harm our business.\nFrom time to time third parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, that our platform capabilities or services infringe their intellectual property rights, and such claims may also result in claims against our customers. These claims may damage our brand and reputation, harm our customer relationships, and create liability for us. We expect the number of such claims will increase as the number of products and services and the level of competition in our market grows, the functionality of our platform or services overlap with that of other products and services, and the volume of issued software patents and patent applications continues to increase.\nCompanies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, many of these companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Furthermore, patent holding companies, non-practicing entities and other adverse patent owners that are not deterred by our existing intellectual property protections have asserted, and in the future may seek to assert, patent claims against us. From time to time, third parties have contacted us inviting us to license their patents and may, in the future, assert patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights against us, our strategic partners or our customers. We have received, and may in the future receive, notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, and, to the extent we gain greater market visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims, which is not uncommon with respect to our market.\nThere may be third-party intellectual property rights, including issued or pending patents, that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods. In addition, if we acquire or license technologies from third parties, we may be exposed to increased risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement due to, among other things, our lower\nlevel of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology and the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, may be very time-consuming, may be expensive to settle or litigate, and may divert our management\u2019s attention and other resources. These claims may also subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights and may require us to indemnify our customers for liabilities they incur as a result of such claims. These claims may also result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We may be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license were available, we may be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. Alternatively, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which may require significant time, effort, and expense, and may affect the performance or features of our platform. If we cannot license or develop alternative non-infringing substitutes for any infringing technology used in any aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our services and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results would adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nOur agreements with customers and other third parties typically include indemnification or other provisions under which we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement or other liabilities relating to or arising from our platform or services or other acts or omissions. Large indemnity payments or damage claims from contractual breach could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other current and prospective customers, reduce demand for our platform and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our services.\nOur platform incorporates open source software code. An open source license allows the use, modification, and distribution of software in source code form. Certain kinds of open source licenses further require that any person who creates a product or service that contains, links to, or is derived from software that was subject to an open source license must also make their own product or service subject to the same open source license. Using software that is subject to this kind of open source license can lead to a requirement that our services be provided free of charge or be made available or distributed in source code form. Although we do not believe our platform includes any open source software in a manner that would result in the imposition of any such requirement, the interpretation of open source licenses is legally complex, and, despite our efforts, it is possible that our platform could be found to contain this type of open source software. Further, few of the licenses applicable to open source software have been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our platform or services in the future.\nMoreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our platform will be effective. If we have not complied with the terms of an applicable open source software license, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our platform on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our services to remove or replace the open source software, to discontinue the sale of our services if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, to pay monetary damages, or to make generally available the source code for our proprietary technology, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to risks related to license requirements, use of open source software can involve greater risks than those associated with use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or assurance of title, performance, non-infringement, or controls on origin of the software. There is typically no support available for open source software, and we cannot assure you that the authors of such open source software will not abandon further development and maintenance. Many of the risks associated with the use of open source software, such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title or performance, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for\nscreening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source software, but we cannot be sure that all open source software is identified or submitted for approval prior to use in our platform.\nResponding to any infringement claim, regardless of its validity, or discovering open source software code in our platform could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition, by, among other things:\n\u00b7\nresulting in time-consuming and costly litigation;\n\u00b7\ndiverting management\u2019s time and attention from developing our business;\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that may not be favorable to us;\n\u00b7\ncausing delays in the deployment of our platform;\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to stop selling some aspects of our platform;\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to redesign certain components of our platform using alternative non-infringing or non-open source technology or practices, which could require significant effort and expense;\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to disclose our software source code, the detailed program commands for our software; and\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers.\nAny failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual protections in the United States and other jurisdictions, all of which provide only limited protection and may not now or in the future provide us with a competitive advantage.\nIn order to protect our unpatented proprietary technologies and processes, we rely on trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, strategic partners, vendors, and others. Also, despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights or develop similar technologies and processes. Further, the contractual provisions that we enter into may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights. Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our technologies, trade secrets and intellectual property is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. To the extent that we expand our activities outside of the United States, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our platform and proprietary information may increase. We may be unable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use or infringement of our platform, technologies, or intellectual property rights.\nWe cannot assure you that any patents we have obtained or that may be issued to us in the future will give us the protection that we seek or that such patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. As of December 31, 2017, we had one issued patent. Any patents that may be issued to us in the future may not provide sufficiently broad protection and may not be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Obtaining and enforcing software patents in the United States is becoming increasingly challenging. Any patents we have obtained or may obtain in the future may be found to be invalid or unenforceable in light of recent and future changes in the law. Similarly, we cannot assure you that any future trademark registrations will be issued from current or future applications or that any registered trademarks we have obtained or may obtain in the future will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights. We also license software\nfrom third parties for integration into our software, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.\nThere can be no assurance that the steps that we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior technologies, products, or services, or that our trademark, patent, and other intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by others. Furthermore, effective trademark, patent, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our software is available or where we have employees or independent contractors. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internet and software-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.\nIn order to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and such fluctuations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAs our international operations expand beyond our current London location, our exposure to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates grows. While we have primarily transacted with customers and business partners in U.S. dollars, we expect to expand the number of transactions with customers and business partners that are denominated in foreign currencies in the future as we expand our business internationally. We incur expenses for some of our internet service provider costs outside of the United States in local currencies and for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our U.K. location in British pounds. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in an increase to the U.S. dollar equivalent of such expenses.\nAccordingly, changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may, particularly in the future as we expand our business internationally, affect our results of operations due to transactional and translational remeasurement. As a result of such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors and securities analysts who follow our stock, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur subscription agreements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore our revenue currently is not subject to foreign currency risk. However, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our platform to current and prospective customers outside of the United States, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe do not currently maintain a program to hedge transactional exposures in foreign currencies. However, in the future, we may use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.\nComprehensive tax reform bills could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, and effective January 1, 2018, the U.S. government enacted H.R. 1, \u201cAn Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018\u201d (informally titled the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d) which includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities. The Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act remains subject to interpretation and further guidance from US taxing authorities and as a result the overall impact of this tax reform is uncertain and may change due to interpretation changes, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. The impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. We are unable to predict what tax reform may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices, could affect our effective tax rates in the future in countries where we have operations and have an adverse effect on our overall tax rate in the future, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or paid, or in the future should collect or pay, sales, use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe do not collect sales, use, value added and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable. Sales, use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and we may be required to collect and/or remit such taxes in the future. While we reserve estimated amounts with respect to such taxes on our financial statements, we cannot be certain that we have made sufficient reserves to cover such tax liabilities or such taxes. If our reserve amounts are inadequate, such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the application of federal, state, local and international tax laws to cloud services are continuously evolving. Income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be enacted or amended at any time, possibly with retroactive effect, which could increase our taxes and ultimately have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes of approximately $37.1 million, which expire in various years beginning in 2029 if not utilized.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-ownership change NOLs to offset future taxable income. As of December 31, 2017, we had not completed a Section 382 limitation study, and postponed completion of our prior study, due to a significant level of legacy ownership both before and after our IPO. We will continue to monitor and assess our significant ownership interests. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could also result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs is dependent on attaining profitability sufficient to offset such available NOLs prior to their expiration. In addition, we may not be able to utilize a portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheet, even if we attain profitability.\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, NOLs generated in 2018 and future years may be carried forward indefinitely but may not be carried back and are only eligible to offset up to a maximum of 80% of taxable income generated in a given year. It is uncertain if and to what extent various U.S. states will conform to the newly enacted U.S. federal tax law.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in U.S. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nU.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Due to the anticipated expansion of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local taxes in the United States and the United Kingdom. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus, by our earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. We may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which a determination is made.\nUnfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy or reductions in marketing information technology spending could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers. The revenue growth and potential profitability of our business depend on demand for email services and email marketing generally and for our services in particular. Current or future economic uncertainties or downturns could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, political turmoil, natural catastrophes, warfare and terrorist attacks on the United States, Europe, the Asia Pacific region or elsewhere, could cause a decrease in business investments, including spending on information technology, and negatively affect the growth of our business. To the extent our platform or services are perceived by customers and potential customers as discretionary, there may be delays or reductions in spending on our services, we may need to reduce our prices in order to remain competitive and our revenue may decline. In addition, the increased pace of consolidation in certain industries may result in reduced overall spending on our platform and services. We cannot predict the timing, magnitude or duration of any economic slowdown, instability, or recovery, generally or within any particular industry. If the economic conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate worsen, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, many of our customers are SMBs. These organizations frequently have limited budgets and are often resource- and time-constrained and, as a result, may be significantly more affected by economic downturns than their larger, more established counterparts. As a result, SMBs may choose to spend the limited funds that they have on items other than our services. Moreover, if SMBs experience economic distress, they may be unwilling or unable to expend time and financial resources on email, which could negatively affect the overall demand for our platform, increase customer attrition and cause our revenue growth or operating results to decline.\nThe success of our business depends on the continued growth and acceptance of email as a communications tool and the related accessibility, expansion, and reliability of the Internet infrastructure.\nThe future success of our business depends on the continued widespread use of email as a primary means of communication and as the document of record for many digital business transactions. Security problems such as viruses, worms and other malicious programs, reliability issues arising from outages and damage to the Internet infrastructure or an overabundance of spam could create the perception that email is not a safe, reliable, or efficient means of communication, which would\ndiscourage businesses and consumers from using email. In addition, alternative communications tools such as social media or text messaging have gained significant widespread acceptance and may gain additional acceptance for both email marketing and transactional record purposes. To the extent use of these alternative communications tools continues to grow, these tools could be used by our customers as a substitute for our services, and demand for our services and our revenues could decline.\nFurthermore, federal, state, or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the Internet as a commercial medium. In addition, government agencies or private organizations have imposed and may impose additional taxes, fees, or other charges for accessing the Internet or commerce conducted via the Internet. We provide our platform through the Internet and many of our customers use our services in connection with their own online transactions. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our platform in order to comply with these changes and could impact our customers\u2019 businesses, reducing demand for our services. These laws or charges could limit the growth of Internet-related commerce or the use of Internet communications such as email or result in reductions in the demand for Internet-based services such as our platform. In addition, the use of the Internet and email as business tools could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands in Internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease-of-use, accessibility, and quality of service. Any decrease in the use of the Internet or email would reduce demand for our platform and harm our business.\nIf we experience excessive credit card or other fraudulent activity, we could incur substantial costs.\nMost of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card or other online accounts directly for subscription fees that we charge. If people pay for our services with stolen credit cards or other wrongly obtained online account information, we could incur substantial third-party vendor costs for which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with credit card billing information online, and we do not review the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our risk of exposure to fraudulent activity. We also incur charges, which we refer to as chargebacks, from the credit card and other online payment processing companies from claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card or other online transaction to purchase our subscription. If the number of unauthorized credit card or other online transactions becomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks and we could lose the right to accept credit cards or other online accounts for payment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results for periods prior to and subsequent to such change and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nIn particular, in May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, Revenue Recognition. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services; this new accounting standard also impacts the recognition of sales commissions. As an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act with respect to ASU 2014-09, and as a result ASU 2014-09 will become applicable to us on January 1, 2019.\nASU 2014-09 permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We continue to evaluate the impact of the new standard and available adoption methods on our consolidated financial statements. We are in the process of evaluating arrangements with customers and identifying differences in accounting between new and existing standards.\nRegardless of the transition method, the application of this new guidance could have an adverse effect on our operating results in one or more periods as compared to what they would have been under current standards.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, and stock-based compensation. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, further increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nMoreover, the demands on management in operating a publicly-traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies, are significant. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage us as a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe also expect that being a public company will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and qualified executive officers.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the year ending December 31, 2018. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting, provided that our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act.\nIf we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We are in the process of designing and implementing the internal controls over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation, which process will be time-consuming, costly, and complicated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, when required, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are related in complex ways. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our IPO in November 2017 at a price of $16.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from an intraday low of $17.50 to an intraday high of $24.45 through December 31, 2017. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the factors that may affect the market price of our common stock include:\n\u00b7\nour operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nfailure to meet revenue, earnings, key metrics or other financial or operational expectations that we establish or are established by securities analysts or investors;\n\u00b7\nthe overall performance and volatility of the equity markets in general or of our industry in particular;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors\u2019 businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u00b7\nthe number of shares of our common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\n\u00b7\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws or regulations affecting our business;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our board of directors or management;\n\u00b7\npublication of research reports about us or our industry or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\npublic reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, including related to new services or functionalities or announced or completed acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\u00b7\nlarge volumes of sales of shares of our common stock by us or our existing stockholders; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral political and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our stock regardless of actual operating performance. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. This form of litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAn active public trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nPrior to the completion of our IPO in November 2017, no public market for our common stock existed. Although our common stock is listed on the NYSE, we cannot assure you that an active public trading market for our common stock will continue to develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not continue to develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares without depressing the market price for the shares or to sell the shares at all. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, a large number of shares of our common stock becoming available for sale or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there were 42,175,647 shares of our common stock outstanding. All shares of common stock sold in our IPO are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless held by our \u201caffiliates,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The resale of 33,370,647 shares of our common stock, or approximately 79% of our outstanding shares as of December 31, 2017, is currently prohibited or otherwise restricted as a result of securities law provisions, market standoff agreements entered into by our stockholders with us or lock-up agreements entered into by our stockholders with the underwriters for our IPO; however, subject to applicable securities law restrictions, these shares will be able to be sold in the public market beginning May 14, 2017. Further, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC on behalf of the underwriters may, in its sole discretion, permit our officers, directors, employees and current security holders who are subject to lock-up agreements to sell shares prior to the expiration of the lock-up agreements. In addition, the shares subject to outstanding options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, of which options and RSUs to purchase 12,217,721 shares and 656,854 shares, respectively, were outstanding as of December 31, 2017, and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans will become available for sale immediately upon the exercise of such options and the expiration of any applicable market stand-off or lock-up agreements, subject to applicable securities law restrictions. On November 15, 2017, we registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity incentive plans. As a consequence, the sale of shares to be issued under our equity incentive plans can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to the lockup agreements and the restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, in the case of our affiliates.\nThe holders of 24,471,780 shares, or approximately 58% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2017, have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. Once we register the offer and sale of shares for the holders of registration rights, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to the lock-up agreements and the restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, in the case of our affiliates.\nWe may issue shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may invest or spend the proceeds of our initial public offering in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a return.\nWe intend to use the remaining net proceeds to us from our IPO for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including developing and enhancing our technical infrastructure, platform, and services, expanding our research and development efforts and selling and marketing operations, meeting the increased compliance requirements associated with our transition to and operation as a public company, and expanding into new markets. We may also use a portion to make acquisitions or investments. However, we do not have any agreements or commitments for any acquisitions or strategic investments at this time. Our management generally will have broad discretion to use the net proceeds, and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these proceeds. Our management might not apply the net proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment. Until we use the net proceeds, we plan to invest them, and these investments may not yield a favorable rate of return. If we do not invest or apply the net proceeds in ways that enhance stockholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nConcentration of ownership among our officers, directors, significant stockholders, and their affiliates may prevent minority investors from influencing corporate decisions.\nOur officers, directors, and their affiliated funds and each of our stockholders who own greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 65.8% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2017. If some of these persons or entities act together, they will have significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentration of ownership could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company. Some of these persons or entities may have interests different from yours.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe never have declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, our credit facility restricts, and any future debt or preferred security arrangements may restrict, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We anticipate that we will retain any future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their shares of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nFor so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including not being required to comply with the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, we have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards. As a result of the\naccounting standards election, we will not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of the year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (ii) the last day of the first year in which our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous rolling three-year period, issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u00b7\nauthorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms, rights, and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our common stock;\n\u00b7\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u00b7\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, or our chief executive officer;\n\u00b7\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nestablish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n\u00b7\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u00b7\nprovide that our directors may be removed for cause only upon the vote of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66%) of our outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u00b7\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u00b7\nrequire the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66%) of our outstanding shares of common stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our management could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. If a court were to find either choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 17097, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SEND"}
