RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TESTING AND REGULATION OF OUR PRODUCTS CANDIDATES\nOur product candidates are in preclinical and clinical stages of development and we may not successfully develop a product candidate that becomes a commercially viable drug.\nThe discovery and development of drugs is inherently risky and involves a high rate of failure. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales, which we do not expect will occur in the short term, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. We do not have extensive experience in discovery and development of commercial drugs. Our product candidates and drug research programs will continue to require significant, time-consuming and costly research and development, testing and regulatory approvals.\nIn addition to our clinical stage programs, we have a limited number of preclinical and research-stage programs in our pipeline. Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not:\n\u2022\noffer therapeutic or other improvement over existing competitive therapies;\n\u2022\nbe proven safe and effective in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nmeet applicable regulatory standards;\n\u2022\nbe capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs; and\n\u2022\nif approved for commercial sale, be successfully marketed as pharmaceutical products.\nOur viability as a company may depend, in part, on our ability to create product candidates for ourselves and our collaborators and if we are unable to do so, our business will be harmed.\nWe must show the safety and efficacy of our product candidates through expensive, time consuming preclinical testing and clinical trials, the results of which are uncertain and governed by exacting regulations.\nOur product candidates are in clinical or preclinical stages of development and may not prove to be sufficiently safe or effective in more advanced human clinical trials. We will need to conduct extensive further testing of all of our product candidates, expend significant additional resources and possibly partner emerging programs to realize commercial value from any of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we and our collaboration partners must demonstrate through preclinical studies (laboratory or animal testing) and clinical trials (human testing) that our proposed products are safe and effective for use in each target indication. This testing is expensive and time-consuming, and failure can occur at any stage. If we terminate a preclinical or clinical program, we will have expended resources in an effort that will not provide a return on our investment and missed the opportunity to have allocated those resources to potentially more productive uses.\nOur product candidates, as well as the activities associated with their research, development and commercialization, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable authorities outside of the United States, for example the European Medicines Agency in the European Union. These regulations govern the manufacturing, assessment of benefit and risk, safety, labeling, storage, commercialization and reimbursement of our product candidates. We or our collaboration partners may encounter problems in clinical trials that may cause us or the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to delay, suspend or terminate our clinical trials at any phase. Changes in regulations or the process for regulatory review during the development or approval phases of our product candidates may cause development delays or rejection of an application for approval.\nNon-U.S. jurisdictions have different approval procedures than those required by the FDA, and these jurisdictions may impose additional testing requirements for our product candidates. In addition, although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of this data is subject to conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. The trial population also must adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will depend on its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. If the FDA does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of the applicable product candidate.\nIt is part of our strategy to pursue clinical development to take advantage of available accelerated regulatory approval processes, such as fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation. For example, the FDA granted fast track designation to miransertib for the treatment of PROS. There is no guarantee that our other product candidates will show the evidence predictive of clinical benefit necessary to qualify for such regulatory treatment. The receipt of such a designation for a product candidate does not guarantee a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualifies for fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may later decide to withdraw such designation if it determines that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification.\nDelays in clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates.\nClinical trials typically take several years to complete. The duration and cost of clinical trials vary greatly depending on the phase of development and the nature, complexity, and intended use of the drug being tested. Even if the results of our clinical trials are favorable, the clinical trials of our product candidates may take significantly longer than expected to complete. Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing for any of our product candidates could significantly affect our product development costs and business plan.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory approval or commercializing our product candidates, including the following:\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or may require discussions regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or preclinical testing or to provide additional information about formulation or manufacture of our product candidates or clinical trial design or to abandon programs;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays related to reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs), clinical investigators and trial sites;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to source suitable diagnostic tests for our trials in targeted patient populations;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nfailure by us, our employees, our CROs or their employees to conduct a clinical trial in accordance with all applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n\u2022\nfailure of our CROs or other third-party contractors to comply with all contractual requirements or to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;\n\u2022\nenrollment in our clinical trials for our product candidates may be slower than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nwe, or regulators, may suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable regulatory requirements and guidance may occur, which could require us to amend clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\nthe effects of our product candidates on patients may not have the desired therapeutic result or may have undesirable side effects that could delay or preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use, if approved; and\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial or the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate.\nIf we experience delays in completion of, or if we terminate, any of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nThe results of early-stage clinical trials and preclinical studies may not be predictive of future results. Initial success in clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained when these trials are completed or in later stage trials.\nThe results from initial preclinical studies and clinical trials of products under development are not necessarily indicative of results that will be obtained from subsequent or more extensive preclinical studies and clinical testing in humans. Clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the required regulatory approvals or result in marketable products. Failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product under development will delay and could prevent its regulatory approval.\nA number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including ArQule and other biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after generating promising results in earlier trials. For example, a positive randomized Phase 2 trial for tivantinib in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) did not lead to a positive outcome in our Phase 3 trials in HCC. In addition, from time to time we report interim data from our clinical trials. Interim data from a clinical trial may not be predictive of final results from the clinical trial.\nIf serious adverse events or undesirable side effects are identified during the development of any product candidates we may develop, we may need to abandon or limit our further clinical development of those product candidates.\nAt any time, a clinical trial can be placed on \u201cclinical hold\u201d or temporarily or permanently stopped for a variety of reasons, principally for safety concerns. If any product candidates we develop are associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side effects we may need or regulatory authorities may require us to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the adverse events or undesirable side effects are less prevalent, less severe, or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary marketing approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nCompletion and duration of clinical trials depends on, among other things, our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients, which is a function of many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe incidence among the general population of diseases which contain therapeutic endpoints chosen for evaluation;\n\u2022\nthe eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u2022\nthe size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s therapeutic endpoints;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit clinical trial investigators and sites with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and\n\u2022\ncompetition for patients by clinical trial programs for other treatments.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would harm our financial position.\nFailure to successfully validate, develop and obtain regulatory approval for companion diagnostics could harm our drug development strategy.\nOne of the key elements of our clinical development strategy is to seek to identify patient subsets within a disease category that may derive particular benefit from the product candidates we are developing. We seek to develop companion diagnostics to help us to identify patients within a particular subset, both during our clinical trials and in connection with the potential commercialization of our product candidates. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. We do not develop companion diagnostics internally and thus we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of third-party collaborators in developing and obtaining approval for these companion diagnostics. We, our partners and our companion diagnostic collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval for companion diagnostics, including issues relating to selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility, clinical validation or concordance. Any delay or failure by our collaborators to develop or obtain regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic could delay or prevent approval of our product candidates. In addition, our collaborators may encounter production difficulties or difficulties sourcing key materials that could constrain the supply of the companion diagnostic, and both they and we may have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostic in the clinical community. If such companion diagnostic were to fail to gain market acceptance, it would have an adverse effect on our ability to derive revenues from sales of products that obtain marketing approval. In addition, the diagnostic companies with whom we and our partners work may decide to discontinue selling or manufacturing the companion diagnostic (or components thereof) that we anticipate using in connection with development and commercialization of our product candidates, or our relationship with such diagnostic companies may otherwise terminate according to the terms of our agreements with them. We may not be able to enter into\narrangements with another diagnostic company to obtain supplies of alternative diagnostic tests for use in connection with the development and commercialization of our product candidates or do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, many current companion diagnostic products use immunohistochemistry (IHC) to identify patients within a target group. The results of IHC tests are determined by pathologists and clinicians and therefore are subject to variation from reader to reader. While efforts are made to ensure rigorous training, such inherent variability can impact patient selection and cause variation from lab to lab and trial to trial.\nWe have limited clinical development and commercialization experience.\nWe have limited experience conducting clinical trials and have never obtained regulatory approvals for any drug. We have not independently completed a Phase 3, or pivotal, clinical trial, filed an NDA or commercialized a drug. We have no experience as a company in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products and do not currently have a sales and marketing organization. Developing commercialization capabilities will be expensive and time-consuming, and could delay any product launch. We may not be able to develop a successful commercial organization. To the extent we are unable or determine not to acquire these resources internally, we will be forced to rely on third-party clinical investigators, clinical research organizations, marketing organizations or our collaboration partners as we did for our Phase 3 trial in HCC. If we are unable to establish adequate capabilities independently or with others, our drug development and commercialization efforts could fail, and we may be unable to generate product revenues.\nIf our drug discovery and development programs do not progress as anticipated, our revenue and stock price could be negatively impacted.\nWe estimate the timing of a variety of preclinical, clinical, regulatory and other milestones for planning purposes, including when a product candidate is expected to enter clinical trials, how soon patients will be recruited and enrolled in these trials, when a clinical trial will be completed and when an application for regulatory approval will be filed. We base our estimates on facts that are currently known to us and on a variety of assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. If we or our collaborators do not achieve milestones when anticipated our revenues and stock price could decline. In addition, our research and clinical testing may be delayed or abandoned if we or our competitors subsequently discover other compounds that show improved safety or efficacy compared to our product candidates, which could limit our ability to achieve milestones and the associated revenue when anticipated or at all, cause us to incur additional expense and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nEven if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, we and our collaborators will be subject to ongoing government regulation.\nEven if regulatory authorities approve any of our product candidates, the manufacture, marketing and sale of these drugs will be subject to strict and ongoing regulation. Compliance with such regulations may consume substantial financial and management resources and expose us and our collaborators to the potential for other adverse circumstances. For example, a regulatory authority can place restrictions on the sale or marketing of a drug in order to manage the risks identified during clinical trials or after the drug is on the market. A regulatory authority can condition the approval of a drug on costly post-marketing follow-up studies. Based on these studies, if a regulatory authority does not believe that the drug demonstrates a clinical benefit to patients or an acceptable safety profile, it could limit the indications for which a drug may be sold or revoke the drug\u2019s marketing approval. In addition, identification of certain side effects either during clinical trials or after a drug is on the market may result in reformulation of a drug, additional preclinical and clinical trials, labeling changes, implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, termination of ongoing clinical trials or withdrawal of approval. Any of these events could delay or prevent us from generating revenue from the commercialization of these drugs and cause us to incur significant additional costs.\nIn addition, if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, we may be subject to various regulatory, civil, or criminal sanctions, including Warning or Untitled Letters, withdrawal or suspension of product approvals. FDA refusal to approval new applications, consent decrees, injunctions, product seizures or detentions, and civil and criminal penalties.\nEven if we or our collaborators bring products to market, we may be unable to price our products effectively or obtain adequate reimbursement for sales of our products, which would have an adverse effect on our revenues.\nThe requirements governing product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after product-licensing approval is granted. As a result, we may obtain regulatory approval for a drug candidate in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that reduce our profits from the sale of the product. In some foreign markets pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to continuing government control after initial marketing approval. Varying price regulation between countries can lead to inconsistent prices and some re-selling by third parties of products from markets where products are sold at lower prices to markets where those products are sold at higher prices. Any practice of exploiting price differences between countries could undermine our sales in markets with higher prices and reduce the sales of our future products, if any.\nAdditionally, third party payors, such as government and private insurance plans, frequently require companies to provide rebates and predetermined discounts from list prices and are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceuticals and other medical products. Our products may not be considered cost-effective, and reimbursement to the patient may not be available or be sufficient to allow the sale of our products on a competitive basis. We, or our collaborators, may not be able to negotiate favorable reimbursement rates for our products. If we, or our collaborators, fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our products by third-party payors, sales of the drugs would be adversely affected or there may be no commercially viable market for the products.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur significant continued losses for the next several years, and our future profitability is uncertain.\nFrom our inception in 1993 through December 31, 2018 we have incurred cumulative losses of approximately $548 million. These losses have resulted principally from the costs of our research and development activities, acquisitions, and enhancements to our technology. In the past we derived our revenue primarily from license and technology transfer fees and payments for compound deliveries associated with our discontinued chemistry services operations, research and development funding paid under our agreements with collaboration partners, and from milestone payments under collaboration agreements.\nWe expect that we will continue to incur significant expenses in order to fund research, development and commercialization of our product candidates. Our expenses could increase beyond our expectations if we are required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities to perform trials in addition to those that we currently expect, or if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates. We currently have a number of product candidates in various stages of clinical development. As a result, we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability.\nTo attain profitability, we will need to develop clinical products successfully and market and sell them effectively, either by ourselves or with collaborators. We have never generated revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates, and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to do so. Even if were to generate product revenues and achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or grow profitability. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of drugs, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. If we fail to become profitable, or if we are unable to fund our continuing losses, we may be unable to continue our business.\nWe are party to a loan and security agreement that contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nIn 2017, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC for a term loan to us in the principal amount of\u2009 $15 million. We are required to repay the loan on or before August 1, 2022. Borrowings under this loan and security agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding certain intellectual property rights. The loan and security agreement restricts our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of our business or property, subject to limited exceptions;\n\u2022\nmake material changes to our business or management team;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions resulting in significant changes to the voting control of our stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain changes to our organizational structure;\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with other entities or acquire other entities;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or create encumbrances on our assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends, other than dividends paid solely in shares of our common stock, or make distributions on and, in certain cases, repurchase our stock;\n\u2022\nrepay subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into certain exclusive licensing arrangements; or\n\u2022\nmake certain investments.\nIn addition, we are required under our loan agreement to comply with various affirmative operating covenants. The operating covenants and restrictions and obligations in our loan and security agreement, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the loan and security agreement, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the facility to become immediately due and payable and eliminate our eligibility to receive additional loans under the agreement.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable, either when such obligations become due, when they mature, or in the event of a default, we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which may negatively impact our business operations and financial condition.\nWe may need substantial additional funding and we may be unable to raise capital when needed, or on terms favorable to us, which could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our drug discovery, product development and commercialization activities.\nDeveloping drugs, conducting clinical trials, and commercializing products are expensive. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception, and we expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to continue our preclinical and clinical development programs. We anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at December 31, 2018, financial support from our licensing agreements and the one year extension of our loan agreement will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next 12 months. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe progress and cost of our ongoing and future clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under our license agreements with Basilea and Sinovant;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing all patent applications, claims, patents and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of securing manufacturing capabilities for our clinical product candidates and commercial products, if any;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of commercializing our product candidates, including establishing or contracting for sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, if any such product candidate receives regulatory approval for commercial sale; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of any acquisitions of or investments in businesses, products or technologies.\nWe may seek the capital necessary to fund our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, or collaboration and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders\u2019 ownership interests will be diluted and the terms of such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 rights. Other debt-financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that would restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to us when required, on satisfactory terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funds when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some of our development and commercialization programs, or obtain funds through other arrangements on unattractive terms, which could prevent us from successfully executing our business strategy.\nWe have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and research and development credit carryforwards which, if we were to become profitable, could be used to offset/defer federal and state income taxes. Such carryforwards may not, under certain circumstances related to changes in ownership of our stock, be available to us.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had federal NOL, state NOL, and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $422 million, $241 million and $28 million respectively, which expire at various dates through 2037. Out of the total federal NOL of\u2009 $422 million $12.6 million of NOL generated in 2018 has an indefinite life. Such carryforwards could potentially be used to offset certain future federal and state income tax liabilities. Utilization of carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state provisions due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. We undertook a detailed study of our NOLs and research and development credit carryforwards through January 31, 2019 to determine whether such amounts are likely to be limited by Sections 382 or 383. As a result of this analysis, we currently do not believe any Section 382 or 383 limitations will significantly impact our ability to offset income with available NOLs and research and development credit carryforwards. However, future ownership changes under Section 382 may limit our ability to fully utilize these tax benefits. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the carryforwards before utilization. If we are not able to utilize our carryforwards, we would be required to use our cash resources to pay taxes that would otherwise have been offset, thereby reducing our liquidity.\nComprehensive tax reform could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn December 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTCJA\u201d), which significantly changed the U.S. federal income tax system. The TCJA, among other things, significantly changed corporate taxation, including reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from a top marginal tax rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limiting the tax deduction for net business interest expense to 30% of adjusted taxable income (with certain excepted businesses), limiting the deduction for NOLs generated during or after 2018 to 80% of annual taxable income and eliminating NOL carrybacks, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions generally referred to as \u201corphan drugs\u201d). We continue to examine the impact the TCJA may have on our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO COLLABORATIONS\nPart of our business strategy involves collaborative out-licensing of our product candidates. We may not be able to find collaborators or successfully form suitable collaborations to further our drug development and commercialization efforts.\nWe have sought and may seek collaborators for our drug development and commercialization efforts. For example, in April 2018 we exclusively licensed derazantinib (ARQ 087) to Basilea Pharmaceutica Limited in the United States, European Union, Japan and the rest of the world, excluding the People\u2019s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan where derazantinib was exclusively licensed to Sinovant Sciences Ltd., a subsidiary of Roivant Sciences Ltd. in February 2018. We may seek to enter into additional future collaborations to obtain external financing for drug development and to obtain access to drug development and commercialization expertise.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. This competition is particularly intense in the oncology field. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe design or results of clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthee likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;\n\u2022\nthe potential market for the subject product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such drug candidate to patients;\n\u2022\nthe existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of the applicable intellectual property, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge;\n\u2022\nthe potential of competing products; and\n\u2022\nindustry and market conditions generally.\nEven if we are able to attract the interest of potential collaborators, the negotiation, documentation and implementation of collaboration agreements are complex and time-consuming. Collaborations may not be available on commercially acceptable terms and, if formed, may not be commercially successful or, if successful, may not realize sufficient benefit for us. If we are unable to form collaborations, we may not gain access to the financial resources and industry expertise necessary to develop and commercialize product candidates or successfully market any product candidate we develop on our own and, therefore, we may have to curtail the development of the product candidate for which we are seeking to collaborate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs. In addition, our past, existing and future collaboration terms contain or will likely contain limitations on the areas of research and development that we may pursue, either alone or in collaboration with third parties.\nOur success depends in part on the efforts of our current and possible future collaborators, who will likely have substantial control and discretion over the continued development and commercialization of product candidates that are the subjects of our collaborations.\nOur current collaborators and future collaborators will have significant discretion in determining the efforts and amount of resources that they dedicate to our collaborations. Our collaborators may determine not to proceed with clinical development or commercialization of a particular product candidate for a number of reasons that are beyond our control, even under circumstances where we might have continued such program. In addition, our rights to receive milestone payments and royalties from our collaborators will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals and achieve market acceptance of products developed from our product candidates. We will also depend on our collaborators to manufacture clinical, and possibly, commercial quantities of our product candidates. Our collaborators may not be successful in manufacturing our product candidates or successfully commercializing them.\nWe face additional risks in connection with our existing and future collaborations, including the following:\n\u2022\nour collaborators may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, products that are similar to or competitive with the products that are the subject of the collaboration with us;\n\u2022\nour collaborators may underfund, not commit sufficient resources to, or conduct in an unsatisfactory matter the testing, development, manufacturing, or commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may utilize our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or potentially invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n\u2022\nour collaborators may encounter conflicts of interest, changes in business strategy or other business issues which could adversely affect their willingness or ability to fulfill their obligations to us. For example, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies historically have re-evaluated their priorities following mergers and consolidations, which have been common in recent years;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and our collaborators delaying or terminating the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates, resulting in significant litigation or arbitration that could be time-consuming and expensive, or causing collaborators to act in their own self-interest and not in the interest of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nwe might not have the financial or human resources to meet our obligations or take advantage of our rights under the terms of our existing and future collaborations; and\n\u2022\nour existing collaborators may exercise their respective rights to terminate without cause their collaborations with us, in which event, we might not be able to complete development and commercialization of the affected product candidates on our own.\nRISKS RELATED TO RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTY VENDORS\nWe rely heavily on third parties such as contract research organizations, to conduct our nonclinical studies and clinical trials. If third parties upon which we rely do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to develop further, obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe do not have the ability or the human resources to perform all of the testing or conduct all of the clinical trials that are necessary in connection with the development of our product candidates. As a result, we rely on CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions, and clinical investigators to ensure the proper and timely conduct of both our our clinical trials and nonclinical studies. While we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on CROs does not relieve us of our responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s current Good Clinical Practices (GCP), which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our product candidates in clinical development. The FDA enforces these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, our agreements with these third parties, including CROs, might terminate for a variety of reasons. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, that would delay our product development activities.\nWe have a limited ability to control whether or not our CROs devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical and nonclinical programs. These CROs may also have relationships with other entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies. We face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by CROs, which may allow our potential competitors to access our proprietary technology. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of\nthe clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates to conduct preclinical and clinical studies. We may not be able to maintain these relationships and could experience supply disruptions outside of our control.\nTo date, our product candidates have been manufactured in relatively small quantities for preclinical and clinical trials. We have no experience in manufacturing any of our product candidates on a large scale and have contracted with third party manufacturers (as have our collaborators) to provide material for clinical trials and to assist in the development and optimization of our manufacturing processes and methods. Our and our collaborators\u2019 ability to conduct clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates will depend on the ability of such third parties to manufacture our products on a large scale at a competitive cost and in accordance with the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and other regulatory requirements. Significant scale-up of manufacturing may result in unanticipated technical challenges and may require additional validation studies that the FDA must review and approve.\nWe do not currently have arrangements in place for a second source for certain aspects of our supply chain. If our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed or if they experience a shutdown or disruption in the facilities used to produce the applicable material, due to technical, regulatory or other problems, we may be required to replace such manufacturer. Although we believe that there are several potential alternative manufacturers at each step of our supply chain, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement manufacturer and in reaching agreement with such alternative manufacturer. If we or our collaborators are not able to obtain contract manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms, obtain or develop the necessary materials and technologies for manufacturing, or obtain intellectual property rights necessary for manufacturing, we may not be able to conduct or complete clinical trials or commercialize our product candidates.\nOur product candidates require precise, high-quality manufacturing. The failure to achieve and maintain these high manufacturing standards, including the incidence of manufacturing errors, could result in patient injury or death, clinical holds, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously hurt our business.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers may undergo inspections by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for compliance with GMP regulations or their foreign equivalent. We and our collaborators have limited control over our contract manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. If these facilities do not satisfy GMP requirements, we and our collaborators may need to conduct additional validation studies, or find alternative manufacturing facilities, either of which would result in significant cost to us as well as a delay in obtaining approval for any affected product candidate. Failure by such third-party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could also result in sanctions being imposed (including fines, injunctions and civil penalties), clinical holds, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nRISKS RELATED TO COMPETITION\nThe drug research and development industry is highly competitive, and we compete with some companies that have a broader range of capabilities and better access to resources than we do.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapid and continuous technological innovation. We compete with companies worldwide that are engaged in the research and discovery, licensing, development and commercialization of drug candidates, including, in the area of small molecule anti-cancer therapeutics, companies such as AbbVie Inc., Amgen, Inc., Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Astellas Pharma, Inc., Array BioPharma Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Celgene Corporation, Curis, Inc.,\nExelixis, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, FORMA Therapeutics, Gilead Sciences, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Incyte Corporation, Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Johnson and Johnson, Merck, Merck KGaA, Novartis AG, Pfizer, Inc., Principia Biopharma, Inc., the Roche Group, Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., and many others.\nWith respect to ARQ 531, we are aware of a number of companies that are or may be pursuing different approaches to C481S-mutant BTK inhibition, including Aptose Biosciences Inc., Roche and Sunesis Pharmaceuticals. Moreover, numerous companies are also pursuing inhibitors of wild-type BTK, including AbbVie with its drug, IMBRUVICA, and AstraZeneca with its drug, CALQUENCE. Other companies with BTK inhibitors currently in development include Astra Zeneca, BeiGene Co., Ltd., Merck KGaA, Eli Lilly, Gilead, GlaxoSmithKline, Principia Biopharma and others. Other approved drugs that may compete to treat ibrutinib refractory patients, including patients with C481S-mutant BTK, include AbbVie\u2019s Bcl-2 inhibitor, VENCLEXTA, and Verastem Oncology\u2019s COPIKTRA.\nWith respect to miransertib (ARQ 092) in rare diseases, we believe Roche is developing taselisib for PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Syndromes (PROS). Regarding miransertib in oncology, we are aware of a number of companies that are or may be pursuing different approaches to AKT inhibition, including Astra Zeneca, Bayer, Eli Lilly, Merck, Novartis, Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Roche. Moreover, numerous companies have pursued and are pursuing inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR, two kinases in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway; these drugs include Idelalisib, an approved PI3K inhibitor, and Everolimus, Temsirolimus and Rapamycin, approved mTOR inhibitors.\nWith respect to derazantinib (ARQ 087), we are aware of a number of companies that are or may be pursuing a number of different approaches to FGFR inhibition, including Astra Zeneca, Bayer, BioClin Therapeutics, Debiopharm Group, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Eisai Co., Ltd., Five Prime Therapeutics, Incyte, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Pfizer, Principia Biopharma, Servier and Taiho Oncology. With respect to iCCA, our lead indication for ARQ 087, we are aware of a number of companies with products under development, including Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceutical, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Cellact Pharma Gmbh, Concordia Healthcare, Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd., Delcath Systems, Inc., Exelixis, InCyte, Novartis, Oncotherapy Services, Inc. and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nEven if we are successful in bringing products to market, we face substantial competitive challenges in effectively marketing and distributing our products. Companies and research institutions, including large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies with significantly much greater financial resources and more experience in developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining FDA and foreign regulatory approvals and bringing new drugs to market are developing products within the field of oncology. Some of these entities already have competitive products on the market or product candidates in more advanced stages of development than we do. By virtue of having or introducing competitive products on the market before us, these entities may gain a competitive advantage. In addition, there may be product candidates of which we are not aware at an earlier stage of development that may compete with our product candidates. Some of our competitors have entered into collaborations with leading companies within our target markets.\nWe are in a rapidly evolving field of research. Consequently, our technology may be rendered non-competitive or obsolete by approaches and methodologies discovered by others, both before and after we have gone to market with our products. We also face competition from existing therapies that are currently accepted in the marketplace and from the impact of adverse events in our field that may affect regulatory approval or public perception.\nWe anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market and advanced technologies become available. If we are unable to successfully compete in our chosen field, we will not become profitable.\nWe may not be able to recruit and retain the scientists and management we need to compete.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled scientific personnel and management, and our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with leading academic institutions, clinicians and scientists. We are highly dependent on our senior management and scientific\nstaff, and the loss of the services of one or more of our other key employees could have an adverse effect on the successful completion of our clinical trials or the commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe compete intensely with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including our collaborators, medicinal chemistry outsourcing companies, contract research and manufacturing organizations, and academic and research institutions in the recruitment of scientists and management. The shortage of personnel with experience in drug development could lead to increased recruiting, relocation and compensation costs, which may exceed our expectations and resources. If we cannot hire additional qualified personnel, the workload may increase for both existing and new personnel. If we are unsuccessful in our recruitment efforts, we may be unable to execute our strategy.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur patents may fail to protect our business. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our product candidates or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, third parties may be able to develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market.\nTo be successful and compete, we must obtain and maintain patents on our products and technology. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for certain aspects of the technology we are developing, but patent protection may not be available for some of our product candidates or their use, synthesis or formulations. The patent position of biotechnology firms is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has recently been the subject of much litigation. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until substantially after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patent applications, or that we were the first inventors to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. In addition, we may rely on our third-party collaborators to file patent applications and prosecute patents relating to proprietary technology that we develop as a part of the collaboration. If our present or future collaborators fail to file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications in a timely manner, our business may be adversely affected.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. For example, the Leahy-Smith America Invents became fully effective in March 2013 and included, among other things, moving to a first inventor-to-file system. Additionally, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. While we cannot predict what form any new patent reform regulations ultimately may take, final governmental rule-making and case law interpreting the new statute could introduce new substantive rules, procedures and case law bases for challenging patents, and certain reforms that make it easier for competitors to challenge our patents could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not know whether our patent applications will result in issued patents. The standards that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. In addition, the receipt of a patent might not provide much practical protection. If we receive a patent with a narrow scope it will be easier for competitors to design products that do not infringe our patent. We cannot be certain that we will receive any additional patents, that the claims of our patents will offer significant protection for our technology, or that our patents will not be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing\nand regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe only have limited geographical protection with respect to certain patents and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents covering our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. While we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our product candidates. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets or other forms of intellectual property, which could make it difficult for us to prevent competitors in some jurisdictions from marketing competing products in violation of our proprietary rights. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. In some jurisdictions, compulsory licensing laws compel patent owners to grant licenses to third parties. Such compulsory licenses could be extended to include some of our product candidates, which could limit our potential revenue opportunities.\nThe drug research and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation, and we may be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits.\nThe drug research and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation, and we believe these lawsuits are likely to continue. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference, derivation, reexamination or inter partes review proceedings before the USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that we infringe with our product candidates or resulting products. In addition, technology created under our research and development collaborations may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, in which case we may not receive milestone or royalty revenue from those collaborations.\nIf we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us, we might have to pay substantial monetary damages, and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use the patented technology or redesign our products so as not to infringe the patent. We may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements at a reasonable cost or effectively redesign our products. Any inability to secure licenses or alternative technology could delay the introduction of our products or prevent us from manufacturing or selling products. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract management from their normal responsibilities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nAgreements we have with our employees, consultants and collaborators may not afford adequate protection for our trade secrets, confidential information and other proprietary information.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and know-how. To protect our trade secrets and know-how, we require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute agreements regarding the confidentiality and ownership of such proprietary information. We cannot guarantee, however, that these agreements will provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and there may not be adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. Our employees, consultants or advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants or advisors had or have previous employment or consulting relationships. Like patent litigation, enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing than our federal and state courts to protect trade secrets. Furthermore, others may independently develop substantially equivalent knowledge to that covered by our trade secrets and know-how. Our failure or inability to protect our proprietary information and techniques may inhibit or limit our ability to compete effectively or exclude certain competitors from the market.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nSome of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, that are important or necessary to the development of one or more of our product candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of a third party to commercialize our own technology or product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from such third party. A license to such intellectual property may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive practice, and companies that may be more established, or have greater resources than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize our product candidates. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their larger size and cash resources or greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. We may not be able to successfully complete such negotiations and ultimately acquire the rights to the intellectual property surrounding the additional product candidates that we may seek to acquire.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent offices, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and patent offices in foreign countries in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and patent offices in foreign countries require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of a patent or patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are not able to obtain patent term extensions in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation, thereby potentially extending the term of our marketing exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be impaired.\nProduct candidates we develop that are approved for commercial marketing by the FDA may be subject to the provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the \u201cHatch-Waxman Act.\u201d The Hatch-Waxman Act provides companies with marketing exclusivity for varying time periods during which generic versions of a drug may not be marketed and allows companies to apply to extend patent protection for up to five additional years. Nevertheless, we may not be granted patent term extension either in the United States or in any foreign country because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the term of extension, as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension, or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product may be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration sooner, and our revenue would likely be reduced.\nRISKS RELATED TO LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE\nWe face potential liability related to the privacy of health information.\nMost health care providers, including research institutions from which we or our collaborators obtain patient information, are subject to privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. Although we are not directly regulated by HIPAA, we could face substantial criminal penalties if we knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a health care provider or research institution that has not satisfied HIPPA\u2019s disclosure standards. In addition, certain state privacy laws may apply directly to our operations and/or those of our collaborators and may impose restrictions on our use and dissemination of individuals\u2019 health information. Moreover, patients about whom we or our collaborators obtain information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may have contractual rights that limit our ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals\u2019 privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nThe collection and use of personal health data in the European Union had previously been governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, which has been replaced by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which became effective on May 25, 2018. While the Data Protection Directive did not apply to organizations based outside the EU, the GDPR has expanded its reach to include any business, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to residents in the EU. This expansion would incorporate our clinical trial activities in EU member states. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for \u201csensitive information\u201d which\nincludes health and genetic information of data subjects residing in the EU. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States or other regions that have not been deemed to offer \u201cadequate\u201d privacy protections. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU member states, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in significant fines.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EU, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may be exposed to potential liability related to the development, testing or manufacturing of compounds we develop and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses.\nWe are developing, clinically testing and manufacturing potential therapeutic products for use in humans. In connection with these activities, we could be liable if persons are injured or die while using these drugs. We may have to pay substantial damages and/or incur legal costs to defend claims resulting from injury or death, and we may not receive expected royalty or milestone payments if commercialization of a drug is limited or ended as a result of such claims. We have product liability and clinical trial insurance that contains customary exclusions and provides coverage per occurrence at levels, in the aggregate, which we believe are customary and commercially reasonable in our industry given our current stage of drug development. Our product liability insurance does not cover every type of product liability claim that we may face or loss we may incur and may not adequately compensate us for the entire amount of covered claims or losses or for the harm to our business reputation. Also, we may be unable to maintain our current insurance policies or obtain and maintain necessary additional coverage at acceptable costs, or at all.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could significantly harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Although we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nWe maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities that may arise from employee injury. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act), and other anticorruption laws that apply in countries\nwhere we do business and may do business in the future. The FCPA, the Bribery Act, and these other laws generally prohibit us, our officers and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We may in the future operate in jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA or Bribery Act violations, and we may participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA, the Bribery Act, or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, which we collectively refer to as Trade Control Laws.\nThere is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, the Bribery Act, or other legal requirements, including Trade Control Laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA, the Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control Laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA, the Bribery Act, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control Laws by U.S., U.K. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations will be directly, or indirectly through our prescribers, customers, and purchasers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations. These laws will impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and educational programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy laws enacted by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that will affect our operations include, but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nAnti-Kickback Statute: prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchasing, ordering, leasing, arranging for, or recommending the purchasing, ordering, or leasing of, any good or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare or Medicaid;\n\u2022\nFalse Claims Act: the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, false or fraudulent claims for payment or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government.\n\u2022\nHIPAA: HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters, and apply regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private);\n\u2022\nHIPAA and HITECH: HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which impose obligations\non HIPAA covered entities and their business associates, including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to maintain the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nTransparency Requirements: the federal physician transparency requirements known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and similar states laws, which requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biological and medical supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022\nAnalogous State, Local and Foreign Laws: analogous state, local and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader than similar federal laws, can apply to claims involving health care items or services regardless of payor, including commercial insurers, and are enforced by many different federal and state agencies as well as through private actions.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable health care laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nThe provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the member states of the European Union, such as the Bribery Act. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.\nPayments made to physicians in certain member states of the European Union must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician\u2019s employer, his or her competent professional organization or the regulatory authorities of the individual member states of the European Union. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the member states of the European Union. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines, or imprisonment.\nRISKS RELATED TO EMPLOYEES, FACILITIES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nOur operations could be interrupted by damage to our laboratory facilities.\nThe efficiency of certain of our operations depends in part upon the continued use of our specialized laboratories and equipment in Bedford, Massachusetts. In the first half of 2019 we plan to transition our laboratory and associated equipment into a new facility in Woburn, Massachusetts. Catastrophic events, including fires or explosions, could damage our laboratories, equipment, scientific data, work in progress or inventories of chemical compounds and biological materials and may materially interrupt that aspect of our business. We employ safety precautions in our laboratory activities in order to reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of these catastrophic events; however, we cannot eliminate the chance that such an event will occur. Rebuilding or relocating our facilities could be time consuming and result in substantial delays in our development of products and in fulfilling our agreements with third parties, including our collaborators.\nSecurity breaches may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur network security and data recovery measures and those of third parties with which we contract, may not be adequate to protect against computer viruses, cyber-attacks, break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. The misappropriation, theft, sabotage or any other type of security breach with respect to any of our proprietary and confidential information that is electronically stored, including research or clinical trial data, could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our clinical activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. This disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Any such breach, loss, or compromise of clinical trial participant personal data may also subject us to civil fines and penalties, either under the GDPR and relevant member state law in the European Union, and HIPAA and other relevant state and federal privacy laws in the United States. Additionally, any break-in or trespass of our facilities that results in the misappropriation, theft, sabotage or any other type of security breach with respect to our proprietary and confidential information, including research or clinical trial data, or that results in damage to our research and development equipment and assets could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur stock price may be extremely volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile. We believe the trading price of our common stock will remain highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to factors such as:\n\u2022\nresults or timing of clinical trials;\n\u2022\nannouncement of FDA approval or non-approval, or delays in the FDA review process, of our or our collaborators\u2019 product candidates or those of our competitors or actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our, our collaborators\u2019 or our competitors\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u2022\nannouncement of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations, including as a result of recognition of upfront licensing or other fees, the timing and amount of expenses incurred for clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nlitigation, including intellectual property infringement lawsuits, involving us;\n\u2022\nfinancing transactions;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries;\n\u2022\nthe general performance of the equity markets and in particular the biopharmaceutical sector of the equity markets;\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel or board members;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning current or future collaborations;\n\u2022\nFDA or international regulatory actions affecting our industry generally; and\n\u2022\nthird-party reimbursement policies.\nThis volatility and general market declines in our industry over the past several years have affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies, often for reasons unrelated to their operating performance, and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. A securities class action suit against us could result in potential liabilities, substantial costs and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, regardless of the outcome of the action.\nSome of our existing stockholders can exert control over us, and their interests could conflict with the best interests of our other stockholders.\nDue to their combined stock holdings, our principal stockholders (stockholders holding more than 5% of our common stock), acting together, may be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even when a change may be in the best interests of our stockholders. Furthermore, the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests as a company or the interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, these stockholders could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that would not be widely viewed as beneficial.\nIf our officers, directors or principal stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued upon the exercise of options) in the public market, the market price of our common stock could fall. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent or deter attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, a change in control, or attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our current Board of Directors. Because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na Board of Directors having three classes of directors with a three-year term of office that expires as to one class each year, commonly referred to as a \u201cstaggered board\u201d;\n\u2022\na prohibition on actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. As a result, it is difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors and, therefore, mergers with and acquisitions of us that our stockholders may consider in their best interests may not occur.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.", "PERMNO": 84052, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ARQL"}
