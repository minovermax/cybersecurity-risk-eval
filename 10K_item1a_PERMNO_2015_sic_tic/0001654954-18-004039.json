RISK FACTORS\nAny investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this prospectus before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by these risks if any of them actually occur. This prospectus also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks we face as described below and elsewhere in this prospectus.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\nWe have incurred losses to date and may continue to incur losses.\nWe have incurred net losses since we commenced operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our net losses were $3,535,926 and $3,633,079.\nWe had an accumulated deficit of $10,500,883 as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $6,964,957. These losses have had, and likely will continue to have, an adverse effect on our working capital, assets, and equity. In order to achieve and sustain such revenue growth in the future, we must significantly expand our market presence and revenues from existing and new customers. We may continue to incur losses in the future and may never generate revenues sufficient to become profitable or to sustain profitability. Continuing losses may impair our ability to raise the additional capital required to continue and expand our operations.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory \u201csay-on-pay\u201d votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 or more; (ii) the last date of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under this registration statement; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the Exchange Act. We will be deemed a large accelerated filer on the first day of the fiscal year after the market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates exceeds $700,000,000, measured on January 1.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions available to emerging growth companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nA company that elects to be treated as an emerging growth company shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as indexed for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under this registration statement; (iii) the date on which it has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which is deemed to be a \u2018large accelerated filer\u2019 as defined by the SEC, which would generally occur upon it attaining a public float of at least $700,000,000.\nRisks Related to our Business\nGrowth of operations will depend on the acceptance of our products and consumer discretionary spending.\nThe acceptance of our healthy beverage products by both retailers to gain distribution and by consumers to include in the beverage consumption repertoire is critically important to our success. Shifts in retailer priorities and shifts in user preferences away from our products, our inability to develop effective healthy beverage products that appeal to both retailers and consumers, or changes in our products that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm our business. Also, our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary user spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Accordingly, we may experience an inability to generate revenue during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty, where users may decide to purchase beverage products that are cheaper or to forego purchasing any type of healthy beverage products, due to a lack of available capital. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, business and financial condition.\nWe cannot be certain that the products that we offer will become, or continue to be, appealing and as a result there may not be any demand for these products and our sales could decrease, which would result in a loss of revenue. Additionally, there is no guarantee that interest in our products will continue, which could adversely affect our business and revenues.\nDemand for products which we sell depends on many factors, including the number of customers we are able to attract and retain over time, the competitive environment in the healthy beverage industry, as well as the beverage industry as a whole, may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending, and ability to anticipate changes in user preferences and to meet consumer\u2019s needs in a timely cost effective manner all could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for the products we plan to offer, which could adversely affect our sales, cash flows and overall financial condition. An investor could lose his or her entire investment as a result.\nWe have limited management resources and are dependent on key executives.\nWe are currently relying on key individuals to continue our business and operations and, in particular, the professional expertise and services of Mr. Brent Willis, Chief Executive Officer, as well as key members of our executive management team and others in key management positions. In addition, our future success depends in large part on the continued service of Mr. Willis. We have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Willis, but the existence of an employment agreement does not guarantee retention of Mr. Willis and we may not be able to retain Mr. Willis for the duration of or beyond the end of his term. If our officers and directors chose not to serve or if they are unable to perform their duties, and we are unable to retain a replacement qualified individual or individuals, this could have an adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and operating results if we are unable to replace the current officers and directors with other qualified individuals.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our operating results could be harmed. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Based on our evaluations, our management concluded that there were no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. Failure to comply with Section 404(a) could also potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nCompetition that we face is varied and strong.\nOur products and industry as a whole are subject to competition. There is no guarantee that we can develop or sustain a market position or expand our business. We anticipate that the intensity of competition in the future will increase.\nWe compete with a number of entities in providing products to our customers. Such competitor entities include: (1) a variety of large multinational corporations engaged in the beverage and healthy beverage industries, including but not limited to companies that have established loyal customer bases over several decades; (2) healthy beverage companies that have an established customer base, and have the same or a similar business plan as we do and may be looking to expand nationwide; and (3) a variety of other local and national healthy beverage companies with which we either currently or may, in the future, compete.\nMany of our current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and greater name and brand recognition than we have. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with both existing and potential customers. They also may be able to offer more products and more aggressively promote and sell their products. Our competitors may also be able to support more aggressive pricing than we will be able to, which could adversely affect sales, cause us to decrease our prices to remain competitive, or otherwise reduce the overall gross profit earned on our products.\nOur industry requires the attraction and retention of talented employees.\nSuccess in the beverage industry, specifically as it relates to our healthy functional beverage products, does and will continue to require the acquisition and retention of highly talented and experienced individuals. Due to the growth in the market segment targeted, such individuals and the talent and experience they possess is in high demand. There is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and maintain access to such individuals. If we fail to attract, train, motivate and retain talented personnel, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be materially and adversely impacted, which could result in the loss of your entire investment.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers of raw and packaging materials.\nWe rely upon a limited number of suppliers for raw and packaging materials used to make and package our products. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to successfully secure such materials from suppliers that are delivered with consistency and at a quality that meets our requirements. The price and availability of these materials are subject to market conditions. Increases in the price of our products due to the increase in the cost of raw materials could have a negative effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw and packaging materials, delays or reductions in product shipments could occur which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The supply and price of raw materials used to produce our products can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as frosts, droughts, other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growing decisions, and various plant diseases and pests. If any of the foregoing were to occur, no assurance can be given that such condition would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our results of operations are dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our requirements of raw materials. Any failure by us to accurately forecast its demand for raw materials could result in an inability to meet higher than anticipated demand for products or producing excess inventory, either of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our sales.\nFood and beverage retailers across all channels in the U.S. and other markets have been consolidating, increasing margin demands of brand suppliers, and increasing their own private brand offerings, resulting in large, sophisticated retailers with increased buying power. They are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices. They also have leverage to require us to provide larger, more tailored promotional and product delivery programs. If we and our distributor partners do not successfully provide appropriate marketing, product, packaging, pricing and service to these retailers, our product availability, sales and margins could suffer. Certain retailers make up an important percentage of our products\u2019 retail volume, including volume sold by our distributor partners. Some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands. The loss of sales of any of our products by a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe depend on third party manufacturers for a portion of our business.\nA portion of our sales revenue is dependent on third party manufacturers that we do not control. The majority of these manufacturers\u2019 business comes from producing and/or selling either their own products or our competitors\u2019 products. As independent companies, these manufacturers make their own business decisions. They may have the right to determine whether, and to what extent, they manufacture our products, our competitors\u2019 products and their own products. They may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands. In most cases, they are able to terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us without cause. We may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass on price increases to them. Their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control, and our business could suffer as a result. Deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third party manufacturers. Any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nFailure of third-party distributors upon which we rely could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely heavily on third party distributors for the sale of our products to retailers. The loss of a significant distributor could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our distributors may also provide distribution services to competing brands, as well as larger, national or international brands, and may be to varying degrees influenced by their continued business relationships with other larger beverage, and specifically, healthy beverage companies. Our independent distributors may be influenced by a large competitor if they rely on that competitor for a significant portion of their sales. There can be no assurance that our distributors will continue to effectively market and distribute our products. The loss of any distributor or the inability to replace a poorly performing distributor in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that we will successfully attract new distributors as they increase their presence in their existing markets or expand into new markets.\nSubstantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur.\nA disruption in production at our beverage manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers, bottlers or distributors. The disruption could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, water scarcity, manufacturing problems, disease, strikes, transportation or supply interruption, government regulation, cybersecurity attacks or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nWe are subject to seasonality related to sales of our products.\nOur business is subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations. Historically, a significant portion of our net sales and net earnings has been realized during the period from May through September. Accordingly, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Our operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of any other results. If for any reason our sales were to be substantially below seasonal norms, our annual revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may fail to comply with applicable government laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation, advertising and sale of our products. Violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation and advertising of our products could damage our reputation and/or result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties. In addition, any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation, or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations, could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures. For example, changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on our beverages and our ingredients could increase our costs. Regulatory focus on the health, safety and marketing of beverage products is increasing. Certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products, such as California\u2019s \u201cProp 65,\u201d which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects, are or could become applicable to our products.\nWe face various operating hazards that could result in the reduction of our operations.\nOur operations are subject to certain hazards and liability risks faced by beverage companies that manufacture and distribute water, tea and energy drink products, such as defective products, contaminated products and damaged products. The occurrence of such a problem could result in a costly product recall and serious damage to our reputation for product quality, as well as potential lawsuits. Although we maintain insurance against certain risks under various general liability and product liability insurance policies, no assurance can be given that our insurance will be adequate to fully cover any incidents of product contamination or injuries resulting from our operations and our products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain insurance with adequate coverage for liabilities or risks arising from our business operations on acceptable terms. Even if the insurance is adequate, insurance premiums could increase significantly which could result in higher costs to us.\nLitigation and publicity concerning product quality, health and other issues could adversely affect our results of operations, business and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government authorities resulting from product defects or product contamination. Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are true, by discouraging customers from buying our products. We could also incur significant liabilities, if a lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us, or litigation costs, regardless of the result. Further, any litigation may cause our key employees to expend resources and time normally devoted to the operations of our business.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining trademark protection, patent protection, and trade secret protection of our products and brands, as well as successfully defending that intellectual property against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our intellectual property related to our trademarks, patents and brands to the extent that we have rights under valid and enforceable trademarks, patents or trade secrets that cover our products and brands. Changes in either the trademark and patent laws or in interpretations of trademark and patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our issued trademarks or our issued patents. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage.\nWe may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend, and could result in our loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages.\nFrom time to time we may face intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or invalidity/non-infringement claims from third parties. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. The outcome of any such litigation can never be guaranteed, and an adverse outcome could affect us negatively. For example, were a third party to succeed on an infringement claim against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages (including up to treble damages if such infringement were found to be willful). In addition, we could face an injunction, barring us from conducting the allegedly infringing activity. The outcome of the litigation could require us to enter into a license agreement which may not be under acceptable, commercially reasonable, or practical terms or we may be precluded from obtaining a license at all. It is also possible that an adverse finding of infringement against us may require us to dedicate substantial resources and time in developing non-infringing alternatives, which may or may not be possible. In the case of diagnostic tests, we would also need to include non-infringing technologies which would require us to re-validate our tests. Any such re-validation, in addition to being costly and time consuming, may be unsuccessful.\nFinally, we may initiate claims to assert or defend our own intellectual property against third parties. Any intellectual property litigation, irrespective of whether we are the plaintiff or the defendant, and regardless of the outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert our management\u2019s attention from our business and negatively affect our operating results or financial condition.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nAlthough we try to ensure that we, our employees, and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we, our employees, or independent contractors have used or disclosed intellectual property in violation of others\u2019 rights. These claims may cover a range of matters, such as challenges to our trademarks, as well as claims that our employees or independent contractors are using trade secrets or other proprietary information of any such employee\u2019s former employer or independent contractors. As a result, we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and this Offering\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and adversely affected by several factors.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including:\n-\nour ability to integrate operations, products and services;\n-\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n-\noperating results below expectations;\n-\nlitigation regarding product contamination;\n-\nour issuance of additional securities, including debt or equity or a combination thereof, which will be necessary to fund our operating expenses;\n-\nannouncements of new or similar products by our competitors;\n-\nloss of any strategic relationship, including raw material provider or distributor relationships;\n-\neconomic and other external factors; and\n-\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have not and may never pay dividends to shareholders.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nThe declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on an investor\u2019s investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would take actions to restore our compliance with The NASDAQ Capital Market listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below The NASDAQ Capital Market minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with The NASDAQ Capital Market listing requirements.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity analyst downgrades our stock or if analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.", "PERMNO": 16593, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "NBEV"}
