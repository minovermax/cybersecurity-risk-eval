Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nCOVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time.\nThe global spread and unprecedented impact of COVID-19 has resulted in disruption to our business, the hospitality industry and the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has led government and other authorities around the world to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement, gatherings of large numbers of people, and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and social distancing measures. Even as these restrictions have been relaxed in some parts of the world, such as many areas of the United States, they remain effective in other parts of the world and have frequently been reimposed in many locations after having been relaxed as a result of additional outbreaks. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have significantly reduced demand for gaming, hotels, resorts, cruises, corporate foodservice, restaurants, university cafeterias, and stadia and have had a material detrimental impact on global commercial activity across these hospitality industries that we serve, and in some cases, has caused the closure of our customers\u2019 businesses. Business closures have resulted in our inability to complete certain implementations and negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 continues to adversely impact our business, operations, and financial results significantly depends on the effect upon the demand for our customers\u2019 hospitality services, which may be affected by, among other things, the duration and scope of COVID-19 (including whether and to what extent a resurgence of the virus could occur after the pandemic initially subsides); the negative impact it has on global regional economies and economic activity, including its impact on unemployment rates and consumer confidence and discretionary spending; its short and longer-term impact on the demand for hospitality businesses; the ability of our customers to successfully navigate the impacts of COVID-19; actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic; and how quickly economies, travel activity, businesses, universities and demand for lodging, destination resorts, cruises and stadia events recovers after the pandemic subsides. To the extent that our hospitality customers\u2019 businesses continue to be impacted, it may have the following effects on our business:\n\u2022\nEffect on Revenue and Liquidity: If our hospitality customers suffer delayed recovery in their revenues, they could be unable to continue to pay for our services, and potentially even go out of business. If our customers are unable or unwilling to continue to pay for our services on a timely basis or at all, our revenue and liquidity would be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nEffect on Growth: As a result of the material sustained reduction in our hospitality customers\u2019 revenue, our customers and prospective customers have substantially curtailed new technology purchases. Customers may also have difficulty obtaining new financing or drawing on existing credit facilities, resulting in them having diminished capital to spend on new technology purchases. Finally, customers or prospective customers may delay, terminate or not go forward with projects in development, for which we may have sold or software.\nIn response to COVID-19, we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency, including furloughing approximately 24% of our employees in the United States, APAC and EMEA during the year. As of May 17, 2021, less than 10 employees remain on furlough. However, the steps we took, and further changes we may make in the future to control our costs, may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees. If this were to occur, we may experience operational challenges that result in a negative impact on our customer services and ultimately, loss of market share, which could limit our ability to grow and expand our business.\nOur business is impacted by changes in macroeconomic and/or global conditions.\nWe conduct our business internationally, changes in global, national, or regional economies, governmental policies (including in areas such as trade, travel, immigration, healthcare, and related issues), geopolitical conditions (such as political unrest and armed conflicts), natural disasters, or outbreaks of disease (such as COVID-19 pandemic) may impact our business. Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services; cause customers not to pay us; or to delay payment for previously purchased products and services.\nFor example, our business is impacted by decreases in travel and leisure activities resulting from weak economic conditions, increases in energy prices and changes in currency values, political instability, heightened travel security measures, travel advisories, disruptions in air travel, and concerns over disease, violence, war, or terrorism. As discussed above under \u201cCOVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time,\u201d our performance has been affected by these conditions associated with COVID-19 and could be further materially affected going forward if these conditions continue for an additional extended period or in other circumstances that we are unable to foresee or mitigate. Even after COVID-19 subsides, our business, markets, growth prospects and business model could be materially impacted or altered as a result of adverse changes in travel and leisure activities.\nSimilarly, increases in energy prices can result in higher ingredient and food costs for our customers with restaurant operations, which may adversely affect demand for our customers\u2019 restaurant businesses, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by international trade disputes.\nWe depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers located outside of the United States, including in China, in connection with the supply of certain of our hardware products and related components. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with international supply. For example, in recent years the United States has imposed and extended greater restrictions on international trade and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China and other countries. Increased tariffs, including on goods imported from China, or the institution of additional protectionist trade measures could adversely affect our supply costs, and in turn, our business, financial results and liquidity.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, product upgrades and services that achieve market acceptance.\nOur business is characterized by rapid and continual changes in technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that in order to remain competitive in the future we need to continue to develop new products, product upgrades and services, requiring the investment of significant financial resources. If we fail to accurately anticipate our customer\u2019s needs and technological trends, or are otherwise unable to complete the development of a product or product upgrade on a timely basis, we will be unable to introduce new products or product upgrades into the market that are demanded by our customers and prospective customers on a timely basis, if at all, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe development process for most new products and product upgrades is complicated, involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including:\n\u2022\nManaging the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nAdapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers; and\n\u2022\nExtending the operation of our products and services to new and evolving platforms, operating systems and hardware products, such as mobile devices.\nOur product development activities are costly and recovering our investment in product development may take a significant amount of time, if it occurs at all. We anticipate continuing to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities because we believe it is necessary to compete successfully. We cannot estimate with any certainty when we will, if ever, receive significant revenues from these investments.\nIf we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to meet our customers\u2019 performance expectations, our reputation may be harmed, and we may be exposed to legal liability.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers depends to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for high quality services and solutions. As a result, if a customer is not satisfied with our products and services, our reputation may be damaged. Moreover, if we fail to meet our customers\u2019 performance expectations or if customers experience service disruptions,\nbreaches or other quality issues, we may lose customers and be subject to legal liability, particularly if such failure, service disruptions or breaches adversely impact our customers\u2019 businesses.\nIn addition, many of our projects are critical to the operations of our customers\u2019 businesses. While our contracts typically include provisions designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our products and services, these provisions may not adequately protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases. The general liability insurance coverage that we maintain, including coverage for errors and omissions, is subject to important exclusions and limitations. We cannot be certain that this coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. A successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face extensive competition in the markets in which we operate, and our failure to compete effectively could result in price reductions and/or decreased demand for our products and services.\nSeveral companies offer products and services similar to ours. The rapid rate of technological change in the hospitality market makes it likely we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us. We believe our competitive ability depends on our product offerings, our experience in the hospitality industry, our product development and systems integration capability, and our customer service organization. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to compete effectively in the hospitality technology market in the future.\nWe compete for customers based on several factors, including price. The competitive markets in which we operate may oblige us to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors. If our competitors discount certain products or services, we may have to lower prices on certain products or services in order to attract or retain customers. Any such price modifications would likely reduce margins and could have adverse effects. In addition, if we fail to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors, we may not be able to retain customers or grow our business, which could adversely affect our revenues and liquidity.\nCyber-attacks involving our systems and data could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have implemented security measures and controls intended to protect our IT infrastructure, data centers and other systems and data against cyber-attacks. Despite our implementation of security measures and controls, our systems and those of third parties upon whom we rely are vulnerable to attack from numerous threat actors, including sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors. Threat actors have and may in the future be able to compromise our security measures or otherwise exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, including vulnerabilities that may have been introduced through the actions of our employees or contractors or defects in the design or manufacture of our products and systems or the products and systems that we procure from third parties. Our systems, and those of our third-party providers, have and could in the future become subject to cyber-attacks, including using computer viruses, credential harvesting, dedicated denial of services attacks, malware, social engineering, and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to, or disrupting the operation of, our systems and those of our third-party providers.\nThe number and scale of cyberattacks have continued to increase and the methods and techniques used by threat actors, including sophisticated \u201csupply-chain\u201d attacks, continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, we may be unable to identify current attacks, anticipate future attacks or implement adequate security measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on our systems, our products, the proprietary data contained therein, our customers and ultimately, our business.\nThese events, and any related operational disruptions, unauthorized access, or misappropriation of information (including personally identifiable information or personal data), could create costly litigation, significant financial liability, and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve customers and cause current or potential customers to choose another provider, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing the protection of personally identifiable information. A failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe collect, process, transmit, and/or store (on our systems and those of third-party providers) customer transactional data, as well as their and our customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 personally identifiable information and/or other data and information. Personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions with regard to privacy and data security such as such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. Moreover, what constitutes personally identifiable information and what other data and/or information is subject to the privacy laws varies by jurisdiction and continues to evolve, and the laws that do reference data privacy continue to be interpreted by the courts and their applicability and reach are therefore uncertain. Our failure and/or the failure of our customers, vendors, and service providers to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could damage our reputation, discourage current and/or\npotential customers from using our products and services, and result in fines, governmental investigations and/or enforcement actions, complaints by private individuals, and/or the payment of penalties to consumers.\nActual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software products may result in reduced sales or liabilities.\nOur software may be used in connection with processing personal data and other sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers). It may be possible for the data to be compromised if our customer does not maintain appropriate security procedures. In those instances, the customer may attempt to seek damages from us. While we believe that all of our current software complies with applicable industry security requirements and that we take appropriate measures to reduce the possibility of breach through our development and implementation processes, we cannot assure that our customers\u2019 systems will not be breached, or that all unauthorized access to our software can be prevented. If a customer, or any other person, seeks redress from us as a result of a security breach of our software, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred losses in each of the last several years, and we may continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred operating losses in each of the last several years, including the year ended March 31, 2021, and we may continue to incur losses in the future as we continue to invest in our products. Our lack of profitability limits the resources available to us to invest in developing new products, product upgrades and services and otherwise in improving business operations.\nWe may incur goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that adversely affect our operating results.\nAs of March 31, 2021, we had $19.6 million and $8.4 million of goodwill and intangible assets (including capitalized software development costs), net, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis. As of March 31, 2020, we determined the net realizable value of intangible assets consisting of capitalized software development costs for certain solutions within our rGuest suite of products no longer exceeded their carrying value, and as a result, recorded non-cash impairment charges of $22.0 million. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry resulted in significantly lower sales and cash flow projections for the related rGuest solutions after evaluating the Company\u2019s strategy for market development and continued costs to support the software. As a result, we recorded impairment charges to reduce the net realizable value of the related assets to zero. Our future operating results and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected if we are required to write down the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets in the future.\nIf we fail to attract, retain and motivate key employees, our business may be harmed.\nOur success depends on the skill, experience and dedication of our employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract, retain and motivate the personnel that we need. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate sufficiently experienced and capable personnel, especially in product development, customer services and support, operations, sales and management, our business and financial results may suffer. For example, if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled technical personnel, our ability to develop high quality products and provide high quality customer service may be impaired. Experienced and capable personnel in the technology industry remain in high demand, and there is continual competition for their talents. Although we believe our compensation, benefits and other employment amenities are competitive in the markets in which we compete for talent, we may have difficulty attracting sufficiently experienced and capable personnel or retaining and motivating talented employees, and in such events our business may suffer.\nAdditionally, in response to COVID-19, we furloughed approximately 24% of our employees in the United States, APAC and EMEA to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency. If this action negatively impacts our ability to attract employees or if employees we desire to return to work do not resume their employment at the end of the furlough, we may experience operational challenges that result in a negative impact on our customer services and ultimately, loss of market share, which could limit our ability to grow and expand our business. See \u201cCOVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time\u201d above for additional information regarding this risk.\nOur international operations have many associated risks.\nWe continue to strategically manage our presence in international markets, and these efforts require significant management attention and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully penetrate international markets, or, if we do, there can be no assurance that we will grow our business in these markets at the same rate as in North America. Because of these inherent complexities and challenges, lack of success in international markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition.\nWe have international offices in the United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and India. We have committed resources to maintaining and further expanding, where appropriate, our sales offices and sales and support channels in key\ninternational markets. However, our efforts may not be successful. International sales are subject to many risks and difficulties, including those arising from the following: building and maintaining a competitive presence in new markets; staffing and managing foreign operations; complying with a variety of foreign laws; producing localized versions of our products; developing integrations between our products and other locally-used products; import and export restrictions and tariffs, enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; potential adverse tax treatment; language and cultural barriers; currency fluctuations; and political and economic instability abroad.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events affecting our principal facilities could cripple our business.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events, particularly those affecting employees in our Alpharetta headquarters or India research and development center, may cause damage or disruption to our operations, and thus could have a negative effect on us. Most of our administrative functions are concentrated in our Alpharetta headquarters and most of our software development activity is concentrated in our India research and development center. We maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, substantially all of our employees throughout the world have been capable of working from home for months at a time without significantly impacting our business. However, a natural disaster, fire, power shortage, pandemic, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event occurring in either geographic location that prevents or substantially impairs our employees\u2019 ability to work, either in the office or from home, could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our products and services to customers.\nWe may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights would diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary technology.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may assert claims that our software or technology infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual property or other proprietary rights. Such claims may be made by our competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. The risk of claims may increase as the number of software products that we offer and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur. Any such claims, regardless of merit, that result in litigation could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays in introducing new or enhanced services or technology, materially disrupt the conduct of our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile we do not believe that our products and services infringe any patents or other intellectual property rights, from time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. For example, on April 6, 2012, Ameranth, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by Ameranth directed to configuring and transmitting hospitality menus (e.g., restaurant menus) for display on electronic devices, and synchronizing the menu content between the devices. This lawsuit remains pending.\nIf we fail to maintain our data centers and other systems, the demand for our subscription services and our ability to operate our business efficiently could diminish, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe currently utilize data center hosting facilities, some of which are managed by third-parties, to provide cloud-based products and hosting services to our customers and to support our internal business operations. If these data center facilities fail or encounter any damage, it could result in interruptions in services to our customers or disruption of our business operations. This could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers, and in turn, our reputation and business could be adversely affected. Similarly, any significant disruption or deficiency in the operation of our internal systems could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill and invoice customer orders, apply cash receipts, place purchase orders with suppliers, and make cash disbursements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWhile we believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\nWe have encountered risks associated with maintaining large cash balances.\nWhile we have attempted to invest our cash balances in investments we considered to be relatively safe, we nevertheless confront credit and liquidity risks. Bank failures could result in reduced liquidity or the actual loss of money held in deposit accounts in excess of federally insured amounts, if any.\nIf we acquire new businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate them or attain the anticipated benefits.\nAs part of our operating history and growth strategy, we have acquired other businesses. In the future, we may continue to seek acquisitions. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire targeted businesses or obtain financing for such acquisitions on satisfactory terms. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations may result in unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention. If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nSome of our products and services may be subject to sales taxes in states where we have not collected and remitted such taxes from our customers. We have reserves for certain state sales tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation. These contingencies are included in \u201cOther non-current liabilities\u201d in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe we have appropriately accrued for these contingencies. In the event that actual results differ from these reserves, we may need to make adjustments, which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to litigation, which may be costly.\nAs a company that does business with many customers, employees and suppliers, we are subject to litigation. The results of such litigation are difficult to predict, and we may incur significant legal expenses if any such claim were filed. While we generally take steps to reduce the likelihood that disputes will result in litigation, litigation is very commonplace and could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur dependence on certain strategic partners makes us vulnerable to the extent we rely on them.\nWe rely on a concentrated number of vendors for the majority of our hardware and for certain software and related services needs. We do not have long term agreements with many of these vendors. If we can no longer obtain these hardware, software or services needs from our major suppliers due to mergers, acquisitions or consolidation within the marketplace, material changes in their partner programs, their refusal to continue to supply to us on reasonable terms or at all, and we cannot find suitable replacement suppliers, it may have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and gross margins.\nRisks Relating to the Industries We Serve\nOur business depends to a significant degree on the hospitality industry and instability and downturns in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBecause our customer base is concentrated in the hospitality industry, our business is largely dependent on the health of that industry. Our sales are dependent in large part on the health of the hospitality industry, which in turn is dependent on the domestic and international economy. Instabilities or downturns in the hospitality industry, such as those resulting from the impact of COVID-19, as discussed above, could disproportionately impact our revenue, as customers may exit the industry or delay, cancel or reduce planned expenditures for our products. For additional information regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, see \u201cCOVID-19 has adversely impacted our business and may further impact our business, financial results and liquidity for an unknown period of time\u201d above for additional information.\nConsolidation in the gaming and other hospitality industries could adversely affect our business.\nCustomers that we serve may seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. The hospitality industry has experienced recent consolidations, including the hotel and gaming sectors of the industry. Although recent consolidations in the hospitality industry have not materially adversely affected our business, there is no assurance that future consolidations will not have such affect. For example, if one of our current customers merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider\u2019s products or services, it could decide to reduce or cease its purchases of products or services from us, which could have an adverse effect our business.\nInsolvencies in the hospitality industry could adversely affect our business.\nCustomers that we serve may be or become insolvent. Most of our customers have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Loss of revenue and other operating challenges may cause some of our customers to declare bankruptcy or cause their lenders to declare a default, accelerate the related debt, or foreclose on their property. Customers in bankruptcy may not have sufficient assets to pay us unpaid fees or reimbursements we are owed under their agreements with us. If a significant number of customers file for bankruptcy or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed to us, our revenues and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Stock\nOur stock has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile.\nOur stock price has been volatile, and we expect it will continue to be volatile. For example, during the year ended March 31, 2021, the trading price of our common stock ranged from a high close of $62.91 to a low close of $14.13. The market price for our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include:\n\u2022\nuncertainties the COVID-19 pandemic has caused for the global economy;\n\u2022\neconomic news or other events generally causing volatility in the trading markets;\n\u2022\nour operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period or failure of securities analysts to publish reports about us or our business;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new offerings or improvements, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nour ability to market new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board or management; general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nOn May 22, 2020, we sold $35 million of preferred stock with a 5.25% cumulative dividend and convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $20.1676 per share. Until converted, the preferred stock may impede stock price increases above the conversion price.\nAdditionally, our ownership base has been and may continue to be concentrated in a few shareholders, which could increase the volatility of our common share price over time.", "PERMNO": 63125, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "AGYS"}
