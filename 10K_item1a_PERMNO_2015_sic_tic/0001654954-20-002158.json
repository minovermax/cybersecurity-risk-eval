{"cik": "701288", "company": "ATRION CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial, or that we have not predicted, may also harm our business operations or adversely affect us.\n\u25cf\nOur sales could decline materially if we lose business from one or more of our larger customers or a significant number of our smaller customers.\nOur sales are generally made under open short-term purchase orders or purchase contracts. Customers with purchase orders could reduce their volumes, or cease purchasing our products, with minimal notice. Customers having purchase contracts may elect not to renew those contracts at expiration or the contracts may be renewed on terms less favorable to us. The loss of, or material reduction in orders by, one or more of our larger customers or a significant number of our smaller customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf\nOur business is dependent on the price and availability of resins and our ability to pass on resin price increases to our customers.\nThe principal raw materials that we use in our products are polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride resins. Our ability to operate profitably is dependent, in part, on the availability and pricing of these resins. The resins we use are derived from petroleum and natural gas; therefore, prices fluctuate substantially as a result of changes in petroleum and natural gas prices, demand and the capacity of the companies that produce these products to meet market needs. Instability in the world markets for petroleum and natural gas could adversely affect the prices of these raw materials and their availability.\nOur ability to maintain profitability depends, in part, upon our ability to pass through to our customers the full amount of any increase in raw material costs. If resin prices increase and we are not able to fully pass on the increases to our customers, our results of operations and our financial condition will be adversely affected.\n\u25cf\nOur business is dependent on third-party sterilization for many of our products, and the closure of sterilization facilities that provide sterilization services for us may adversely affect our business.\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, recently issued a caution concerning a nationwide shortage of medical devices due to issues with contract sterilizers. Two significant contract sterilization facilities that service many medical device companies were shut down in 2019 due to environmental concerns-one permanently and one temporarily-and local officials asked a third facility to voluntarily halt operations. The loss of sterilization capacity caused significant delays at this country\u2019s remaining sterilization facilities. If we do not have access to sterilization facilities that have a capacity to process our products requiring sterilization, we may experience delays in, or reduction of, sales and deliveries of those products.\n\u25cf\nThe loss of a key supplier of raw materials could lead to increased costs and lower profit margins.\nThe loss of a key supplier could force us to purchase raw materials in the open market, which may be at higher prices, until we could secure another source and such higher prices may not allow us to remain competitive. If we are unable to obtain raw materials in sufficient quantities, we may not be able to manufacture our products. Even if we were able to replace one of our raw material suppliers through another supply arrangement, there is no assurance that the terms that we enter into with such alternate supplier will be as favorable to us as the supply arrangements that we currently have or that such replacement could be timely completed. A disruption or termination in the supply of raw materials could result in our inability to meet the demand for our products, which could adversely affect our revenue generation and result in customer dissatisfaction.\n\u25cf\nPolitical and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nOur business may be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control such as general geopolitical economic and business conditions, conditions in the financial markets, and changes in the overall demand for our products. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our customers\u2019 financial condition and the levels of business activity of our customers. Uncertainty about current global political or economic conditions could cause businesses to postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for our products. There could be additional effects on our business from these economic developments including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit, the inability of our customers to pay for or obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products. Turbulence in the United States and international markets and economies could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\u25cf\nProduct liability claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims involving claims of personal injury or property damage. Our product liability insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the cost of defense and the potential award in the event of a claim. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or outcome, could result in significant legal defense costs. Also, a well-publicized actual or perceived problem with one or more of our products could adversely affect our reputation and reduce the demand for our products.\n\u25cf\nIssues with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products.\nOur success depends upon the quality and reliability of our products. Quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our products and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. Although we have one quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity or a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, we have made and continue to make significant investments in assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Product quality or safety issues and costs associated there with may restrict us from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments and may adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\nUnaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our manufacturing and R&D organizations. Third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays, service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results.\n\u25cf\nAny losses we incur as a result of our exposure to the credit risk of our customers could harm our results of operations.\nWe monitor individual customer payment capability in granting credit arrangements, seek to limit credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. As we have grown our revenue and customer base, our exposure to credit risk has increased. Any material losses as a result of customer defaults could harm, and have an adverse effect on, our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nThe success of certain of our products depends upon relationships with healthcare professionals.\nThe research, development, marketing, and sales of many of our new and improved products are dependent upon our maintaining working relationships with healthcare professionals. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding our products. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these professionals and do not continue to receive their advice and input, the development and commercialization of our products could suffer, which could have a material, adverse impact on our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n\u25cf\nOur success is measured in part by our ability to develop patentable products, to preserve our trade secrets and operate without infringing or violating the proprietary rights of third parties.\nOur ability to remain competitive is dependent, in part, upon our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and prevent other companies from using our intellectual property. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements. However, these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Additionally, these measures may not prevent competitors from duplicating our products or gaining access to our proprietary information and technology. Third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise use our intellectual property without authorization, and we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, vendors, former employees and current employees, despite the existence of nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operations, or financial condition. Others may challenge the validity of any patents issued to us, and we could encounter legal and financial difficulties in enforcing our patent rights against infringers. In addition, there can be no assurance that other technologies cannot or will not be developed or that patents will not be obtained by others which would render our patents less valuable or obsolete. Our patents expire at various times over the next 18 years. Once patents expire, some customers may not continue to purchase from us, opting for competitive copies instead. In such event, our sales and profits could decline substantially. During the terms of our patents, third parties may develop similar or superior technology independently or by designing around our patents. Additionally, if we do not develop and launch new products prior to the expiration of patents or before the demand for our existing products declines, our sales and profits could be adversely affected.\nWe have developed technical knowledge which, although non-patentable, we consider to be significant in enabling us to compete. However, the proprietary nature of such knowledge may be difficult to protect. We have entered into agreements with key employees prohibiting them from disclosing any of our trade secrets or other confidential information. In addition, generally these agreement also provide that inventions or discoveries relating to our business by these individuals will be assigned to us and become our sole property. We cannot assure you that the enforceability of these agreements will not be challenged or that our trade secrets will not become known to, or be independently developed by, our competitors.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation, and companies in the medical device industry sometimes use intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is often complex and expensive, and the outcome of this litigation is generally difficult to predict. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties or pay royalties that may be substantial. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf\nInternational patent protection is uncertain.\nPatent law outside the United States is uncertain and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. We may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our or our competitors\u2019 foreign patents, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts.\n\u25cf\nNew lines of business or new or enhanced products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nWe may implement new lines of business or offer new or enhanced products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business or new or enhanced products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and new or enhanced products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new or enhanced product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business or new or enhanced product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal control. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new or enhanced products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nSome of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do, and it may be difficult for us to compete against them.\nIn many of our markets, we compete with numerous other companies that have substantially greater financial resources and engage in substantially more R&D activities than we do. Furthermore, innovations in surgical techniques or medical practices could have the effect of reducing or eliminating market demand for one or more of our products. In addition, the trend of consolidation in the medical device industry and among our customers could result in greater competition and pricing pressure.\nSome of the markets in which we compete are dominated by established manufacturers that have broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, substantially larger marketing, R&D staffs and facilities than we do. Many of these competitors offer broader product lines within the specific product market and in the general field of medical devices and supplies. Broad product lines give many of our cardiovascular and fluid delivery competitors the ability to negotiate exclusive, long-term medical device supply contracts and, consequently, the ability to offer comprehensive pricing of their competing products. By offering a broader product line in the general field of medical devices and supplies, competitors may also have a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations. In addition, our competitors may use price reductions to preserve market share in their product markets.\n\u25cf\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations that could result in significant liability, require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and health programs outside the United States. These laws and regulations are wide ranging and subject to changing interpretations and applications, which could restrict our sales or marketing practices. A violation of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\n\u25cf\nWe will be unable to sell our products if we fail to comply with governmental regulations.\nTo manufacture our products commercially, we must comply with governmental regulations that govern design controls, quality systems and documentation policies and procedures, including continued compliance with QSR. The FDA and equivalent foreign governmental authorities periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our Original Equipment Manufacturer, or OEM, medical device customers. If we or our OEM medical device customers fail to comply with these manufacturing regulations, including meeting reporting obligations to the FDA, or fail any FDA inspections, marketing or distribution of our products may be prevented or delayed, which would negatively impact our business.\n\u25cf\nOur products are subject to product recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval, and any such recalls would negatively affect our financial performance and could harm our reputation.\nAny of our products may be found to have significant deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of any such defective products. A government-mandated or voluntary recall could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects. We do not maintain insurance to cover losses incurred as a result of product recalls. Any product recall would divert managerial and financial resources and negatively affect our financial performance and could harm our reputation with customers and end-users.\n\u25cf\nWe may not receive regulatory approvals for new product candidates or for modifications of existing products or approvals may be delayed.\nRegulation by governmental authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of our proposed products and in our ongoing research and product development activities. Any failure to receive the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates, or the subsequent withdrawal of any such approvals, would harm our business. Additionally, modification of our existing products may require regulatory approval. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with federal and state statutes and regulations require spending substantial time and financial resources. If we fail to obtain or maintain, or encounter delays in obtaining or maintaining, regulatory approvals, the marketing of any products we develop or modify, our ability to receive product revenues, and our liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected.\n\u25cf\nAny major disruption or failure of our information technology systems, or our failure to successfully implement new technology effectively, could adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe rely on\nvarious information technology systems to manage our operations. Over the last several years, we have been and continue to implement modifications and upgrades to our systems, including making changes to legacy systems, replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality and acquiring new systems with new functionality For example, over the next several years, we plan to continue the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning system across our company. These activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and upgrading these systems, including impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders, potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time, and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new or upgraded systems or of integrating new or upgraded systems into our current systems. Our system implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. In addition, the difficulties with implementing new or upgraded technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and operations, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated.\n\u25cf\nWe face cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nWe utilize systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, and others, including personal information. As evidenced by the numerous companies that have suffered serious data security breaches, we may be vulnerable to, and unable to anticipate or detect, data security breaches and data loss, including rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks. In addition, data security breaches can also occur as a result of a breach by us or our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In addition to our own databases, we use third-party service providers to store, process and transmit confidential or sensitive information on our behalf. Although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a data security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. A data security breach may expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, and could result in significant costs to us, which may include, among others, fines and penalties, potential liabilities from governmental or third-party investigations, proceedings or litigation and diversion of management attention. We could also experience delays or interruptions in our ability to function in the normal course of business, including delays in the fulfillment of customer orders or disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of products. In addition, actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. In the United States, various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, disclosure and security of certain types of data, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act and state laws relating to privacy and data security. Several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, also have laws and regulations dealing with the handling and processing of personal information obtained from their residents, which in certain cases are more restrictive than those in the United States. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of various types of data, including data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses and, in some jurisdictions, internet protocol addresses. Such laws and regulations may be modified or subject to new or different interpretations, and new laws and regulations may be enacted in the future. Within the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018 and replaced the 1995 European Union Data Protection Directive and superseded applicable European Union member state legislation, imposes significant new requirements on how companies collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for noncompliance. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\n\u25cf\nWe sell many of our products to healthcare providers that rely on Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans to reimburse the costs associated with the procedures performed using our products and these third party payors may deny reimbursement for use of our products.\nWe are dependent, in part, upon the ability of healthcare providers to obtain satisfactory reimbursement from third-party payors for medical procedures in which our products are used. Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a prescribed product has not received appropriate regulatory clearances or approvals, is not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by the payor, or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain reimbursement from third-party payors, or adverse changes in government or private third-party payors\u2019 policies toward reimbursement for procedures utilizing our products, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Major third-party payors for medical services in the United States and other countries continue to try to contain healthcare costs. The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to charges for services performed. Further implementation of legislative or administrative reforms to the United States or international reimbursement systems in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our products or denies coverage for such procedures may result in hospitals or physicians substituting lower cost products or other therapies for our products which, in turn, would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainty about whether and how changes may be implemented could also have a negative impact on the demand for our products.\n\u25cf\nChanges in healthcare legislation and policy may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs have been and continue to be introduced in the United States. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which made changes that have impacted and are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Among other things the Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund health insurance coverage expansions. The Affordable Care Act also implemented a number of Medicare payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models, and appropriated funding for comparative effectiveness research. The taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act and the expansion in the government\u2019s role in the United States healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursement by payors for our products, and reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts by the Trump Administration to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2 percent per fiscal year, which will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. It is unclear what impact new quality and payment programs may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, and discounts, and require marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. We believe that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our customers. Any changes in, or uncertainty with respect to, future reimbursement rates could impact our customers\u2019 demand for our products, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Further, the federal, state and local governments, Medicare, Medicaid, managed care organizations, and foreign governments have in the past considered, are currently considering, and may in the future consider healthcare policies and proposals intended to curb rising healthcare costs, including those that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services. Future significant changes in the healthcare systems in the United States or other countries, including changes intended to reduce expenditures along with uncertainty about whether and how changes may be implemented, could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. We are unable to predict whether other healthcare policies, including policies stemming from legislation or regulations affecting our business, may be proposed or enacted in the future; what effect such policies would have on our business; or the effect ongoing uncertainty about these matters will have on our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions.\n\u25cf\nOur existing credit agreement contains restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur existing credit agreement contains, and any future agreements may contain, covenants that could impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. Although we currently do not have any borrowings under our existing credit agreement, the covenants in those agreements may limit the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\n\u25cf\nWe have pledged certain of our assets as collateral under our existing credit agreement. If we borrow funds under that credit agreement and default on the terms of such credit agreement and the holder of our indebtedness accelerates the repayment of such indebtedness, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness.\nUnder our existing credit agreement, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios. A failure to comply with the covenants contained in the agreement could result in an event of default under such agreement, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and profitability. In the event of any default under our existing credit agreement, the holder of our indebtedness thereunder:\n\u25cf\nWill not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u25cf\nCould elect to declare all indebtedness outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, if applicable; or\n\u25cf\nCould require us to apply all of our available cash to repay such indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to repay those amounts, the holder of our indebtedness could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the indebtedness under our existing credit agreement were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets at that time would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.\n\u25cf\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities we engage in can be intense, and we may not be able to hire qualified people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\n\u25cf\nA portion of our business relies on distribution agreements and relationships with various distributors and any adverse change in those relationships could result in a loss of revenue and harm that business.\nWe have strategic relationships with, and sell many of our products through, a number of distributors.. To the extent that we rely on distributors, our success will depend on the efforts of others over whom we may have little or no control. Some of our distributors also sell our competitors\u2019 products, and, if they favor our competitors\u2019 products for any reason, they may fail to market our products as effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, which would cause our results to suffer. The success of the arrangements with these distributors depends, in part, on the continued adherence to the terms of our agreements with them. Any disruption in these arrangements may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The actions of distributors in foreign countries may adversely affect our ability to market effectively our products in those countries, particularly if a distributor holds the regulatory authorization in such countries and such actions result in the suspension or revocation of such authorization. In such cases, re-establishing market access or regulatory authorization may be difficult, expensive or time consuming. Also, we may be named as a defendant in litigation against our distributors related to sales of our products by them.\n\u25cf\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other external events could significantly impact our business.\nWe currently conduct all our development, manufacturing and management at three locations. Severe weather, natural disasters, public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness such as a novel coronavirus, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events at any one or more of these locations could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. We have the ability to transfer the production of certain products from a facility affected by such events, but doing so would be expensive. Our disaster recovery policies and procedures may not be effective and the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses.\n\u25cf\nOur sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.\nA substantial portion of our sales occur outside the United States, and we are increasing our presence in international markets. Sales outside the United States subject us to many risks, such as:\n\u25cf\neconomic or political instability, natural disasters, public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness such as a novel coronavirus, war and terrorism that disrupt foreign healthcare payment systems or businesses;\n\u25cf\nthe imposition of governmental controls;\n\u25cf\nless favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws;\n\u25cf\nprotectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to obtain any necessary foreign regulatory or pricing approvals of products in a timely manner;\n\u25cf\nchanges in trade policies, tariffs and tax laws;\n\u25cf\nreceivables may be more difficult to collect; and\n\u25cf\nlonger payment cycles.\nOur operations and marketing practices are also subject to regulation and scrutiny by the governments of the other countries in which we operate. In addition, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits United States companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. In certain countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign official for purposes of the FCPA. Additionally, we are subject to other United States laws in our international operations. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions.\n\u25cf\nWe may lose revenues, market share and profits due to exchange rate fluctuations related to our international business.\nFluctuations in exchange rates may affect the prices that our international customers are willing to pay and may put us at a price disadvantage compared to other competitors. Potentially volatile shifts in exchange rates may negatively affect our financial condition and operations. Because payments from our international customers are received primarily in United States dollars, increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive or less affordable, and therefore adversely affect our sales in international markets.\n\u25cf\nWe may experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.\nWe have historically experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control and may result in volatility of our stock price. Future operating results will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\ndemand for our products;\n\u25cf\npricing decisions, and those of our competitors, including decisions to increase or decrease prices;\n\u25cf\nregulatory approvals for our products;\n\u25cf\ntiming and levels of spending for R&D, sales and marketing;\n\u25cf\ntiming and market acceptance of new product introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\ndevelopment or expansion of business infrastructure in new clinical and geographic markets;\n\u25cf\ntax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nshipping delays or interruptions;\n\u25cf\ncustomer credit holds;\n\u25cf\ntiming and recognition of certain R&D milestones and license fees; and\n\u25cf\nability to control our costs;\n\u25cf\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their common stock when they want to and at prices they find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u25cf\nrecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company;\n\u25cf\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding the Company and our competitors;\n\u25cf\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u25cf\ntrading by funds with high-turnover practices or strategies;\n\u25cf\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Company or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nfailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nour stock repurchase program;\n\u25cf\nchanges in government regulations; and\n\u25cf\neconomic or political instability, natural disasters, public health crises, acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nAdditionally, our public float is small which can result in large fluctuations in stock price during periods with increased selling or buying activity. General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\n\u25cf\nWe continue to evaluate expansion through acquisitions of, and investments in, other companies or technologies, which may carry significant risks.\nIf we pursue acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies or technologies, we may:\n\u25cf\nUse cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u25cf\nIncur debt, including on terms that could be unfavorable to us or debt that we might be unable to repay;\n\u25cf\nStructure the transaction in a manner that has unfavorable tax consequences, such as a stock purchase that does not permit a step-up in the tax basis for the assets acquired;\n\u25cf\nBe unable to realize the anticipated benefits, such as increased revenues, cost savings, or synergies from additional sales;\n\u25cf\nBe unable to integrate, upgrade, or replace the purchasing, accounting, financial, sales, billing, employee benefits, payroll, and regulatory compliance functions of an acquisition target;\n\u25cf\nBe unable to secure or retain the services of key employees related to the acquisition;\n\u25cf\nBe unable to succeed in the marketplace with the acquisition; or\n\u25cf\nAssume material unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business.\nAny of the above risks, should they occur, could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows, including the inability to recover our investment or cause a write down or write off of such investment, associated goodwill, or assets.\n\u25cf\nIf we make divestitures, we could encounter difficulties that harm our business.\nWe may sell a business or product line. Any divestiture may result in significant write-offs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Divestitures could also involve additional risks, including difficulties in separation of operations, services and personnel, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other operations and the potential loss of key personnel.\n\u25cf\nThe enactment of tax reform legislation could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nLegislation or other changes in tax laws could materially affect our financial position and results of operation. For example, the Tax Act was enacted in the United States on December 22, 2017. Among other changes, the Tax Act reduces the United States corporate statutory tax rate and eliminates, limits or adds certain deductions. The tax and accounting treatment of the changes under the Tax Act are complex, and some of the changes as well as other tax reform legislation may affect both current and future periods. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where tax determinations may be uncertain. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge, which could result in additional taxation, penalties and interest payments.\n\u25cf\nIf we fail to manage our exposure to market risk and credit risk successfully, our financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nWe have exposure to market risk and credit risk in our investment activities. The fair values of our investments vary from time to time depending on economic and market conditions. Fixed income securities expose us to interest rate risk as well as credit risk. Equity securities expose us to equity price risk. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. These and other factors also affect the equity securities owned by us. The outlook of our investment portfolio depends on the future direction of interest rates, fluctuations in the equity securities market and the amount of cash flows available for investment. Our investments may decline in value in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\u25cf\nProvisions in our governing documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the ownership of the Company or a change in our management. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock. Although a delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or of changes in our Board of Directors could be effective in improving stockholder value, they also carry a risk of causing the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 11587, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "ATRI"}
