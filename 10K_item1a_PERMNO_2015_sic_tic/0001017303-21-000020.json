{"cik": "1017303", "company": "TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below, as well as other disclosures in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, because they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and growth prospects. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may also impair our business operations. In the event that such risks or uncertainties materialize, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe assume no obligation (and specifically disclaim any such obligation) to update these Risk Factors or any other forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe experienced a net loss in 2020, anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve, maintain or increase profitability in the future.\nWe incurred a net loss of $5.6 million in 2020, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve, maintain or increase profitability in the future. We expect our costs will increase over time and our losses to continue as we expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our food service technology business and transitioning away from other lines of business. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on developing our food service technology business, including expanding our offerings, developing or acquiring new products and services and increasing our sales and marketing efforts. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth in our food service technology business. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from achieving, maintaining or increasing profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses in the future and may not be able to achieve, maintain or increase profitability\nOur operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.\nOur operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and are likely to continue to vary due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical operating results, the market price of our common stock will likely decline. Fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those identified throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u25cf delays between our expenditures to develop and market new or enhanced products and consumables and the generation of sales from those products;\n\u25cf the geographic distribution of our sales and our supply chain;\n\u25cf market acceptance of our products, both domestically and internationally;\n\u25cf development of new competitive products by others;\n\u25cf our responses to price competition;\n\u25cf our level of research and development activities;\n\u25cf changes in the amount that we spend to develop, acquire or license new products, consumables, technologies or businesses;\n\u25cf changes in the amount we spend to promote our products and services;\n\u25cf changes in the cost of satisfying our warranty obligations and servicing our installed base of products;\n\u25cf availability of third-party components at reasonable prices;\n\u25cf general economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates affecting returns on cash balances and investments, that affect customer demand;\n\u25cf fluctuations of world-wide oil and gas prices;\n\u25cf the dependence of our supply chain on a few, foreign third-party manufacturers and suppliers;\n\u25cf severe weather events, public health crises, and other external events out of our control that can disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 facilities; and\n\u25cf changes in accounting rules.\nDue to all of the foregoing factors, and the other risks discussed in this Form 10-K, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be an indicator of future performance.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is likely to continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and capital resources, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of our suppliers and customers. We are unable to predict the ultimate extent to which the pandemic and related effects will adversely impact our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations, capital resources and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the numerous disease control measures being taken to limit the spread of COVID-19, we have experienced, and can be expected to continue to experience, disruptions to our business, our operations, the delivery of our products and customer demand for our products, including the following:\n\u25cf operating losses in excess of those we anticipated in transitioning our business focus toward the food service technology market, which, in addition to the factors discussed below, may require us to seek to obtain additional capital through debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund operations, or if such arrangements are not available, to take additional significant cost-cutting measures;\n\u25cf supply chain disruptions, including delayed product shipments from two contract manufacturers located in China and Thailand that conduct substantially all of our printer and terminal manufacturing, which, if sustained, could lead to insufficient inventory levels and harm our ability to deliver products to our customers on time or at all;\n\u25cf continuing or new restrictions on the operations of our customers in the casino industry and food service industry, including, in some cases, partial or complete business shutdowns, which have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, reduced demand for our products in the two primary markets that we serve;\n\u25cf an inability of our customers to make payments in a timely fashion or at all, which may continue even after operating restrictions are lifted in the event that the downturn in economic conditions persist;\n\u25cf devotion of significant time, management attention and resources to monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts, and anticipated impacts, on our business, and seeking to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on our business and workforce, which diverts management\u2019s attention and resources away from strategic initiatives, new business opportunities, the transition of our business toward the food service and casino and gaming markets, and the overall profitability of our business;\n\u25cf necessary modifications to our business practices and operations, including suspension of employee travel, cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences and social distancing measures, including work-from-home policies, and such further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and suppliers, which may adversely impact efficiency and productivity and may increase operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, and have affected the way that we conduct our product development, marketing, customer support and other activities;\n\u25cf a permanent reduction in workforce, furlough of workers and an across-the-board 10% salary reduction, as well as other cost-cutting measures we have taken to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our business, which may, along with any additional such measures that may be taken in the future, impair our ability to operate and have a negative effect on employee loyalty and our reputation and, if furloughed employees do not return following the crisis, or if employees seek higher-paying jobs, may limit our ability to restart operations following the crisis and to grow our food service technology business as planned;\n\u25cf a possible future reduction in the value of goodwill or other intangible assets causing the carrying value of such assets to exceed their fair value, which could require us to recognize asset impairment;\n\u25cf difficulty predicting our manufacturing requirements accurately due to volatile economic conditions and uncertainty as to when our customers may resume operations, which could result, in the case of an underestimate, in inadequate manufacturing capacity or inventory, interruptions in production and delayed deliveries to customers (with resulting losses in orders or customers lowering our net sales), or in the case of an overestimate, in an excess inventory of component parts or manufactured products;\n\u25cf increases in prices and/or decreases in availability of component parts and raw materials needed to produce our products;\n\u25cf foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to volatile global economic conditions, which could negatively affect earnings and the value of our assets held outside the United States, and if we increase prices to absorb a portion of the currency impact, could cause demand to decrease;\n\u25cf volatility of, and decreases in, trading prices of our common stock; and\n\u25cf the possibility that we may need to raise additional capital through an equity or debt financing to support operations but are unable to do so due to, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, trading prices of our common stock and the outlook for the industries that we serve, all of which could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, such that there can be no assurance that such financing would be available to us.\nIf we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funding, our existing shareholders may experience dilution and we may incur significant financing costs. If we issue debt securities or otherwise incur additional debt, we would have additional debt service obligations, could become subject to additional restrictions limiting our ability to operate our business, and may be required to further encumber our assets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly, and additional material impacts and disruptions may occur. The factors described above, which may worsen, have had and, along with other factors that we cannot predict, can be expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and capital resources. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments, which cannot be accurately predicted, including the duration of the pandemic, additional or modified government actions, new information that may emerge concerning the severity and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, newly identified strains of COVID-19, the rollout and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments and the actions taken to contain COVID-19 or address its impact in the short and long term, among others. We do not yet know and cannot predict the full extent of potential impacts on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and capital resources.\nIn addition, any of the risks and uncertainties set forth in this Form 10-K can be expected to be further heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and capital resources and the achievement of our strategic objectives\nOur revenue and profitability depend on our ability to continue to develop or license, on a timely basis, new products and technologies which are free from hardware or software anomalies and cannot be fraudulently manipulated, and customer acceptance of such products.\nOur success depends upon our and our development partners\u2019 ability to timely adapt our capabilities and processes to meet the demands of producing new and innovative products. Because our newer products contain software and generally are more technologically sophisticated than those we have produced in the past, we must continually refine our capabilities to meet the needs of our product innovation. If we cannot efficiently adapt our infrastructure to meet the needs of our product innovations in a timely manner, our business could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, even if we, or developers on our behalf, successfully develop such products, there is no assurance that our innovations will be accepted by our customers. Developing and marketing new products, such as our BOHA! ecosystem, is costly, and our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to generate sales of such products or if our existing or new customers do not quickly accept such products. Customer acceptance is crucial because new products typically have very little competition and market penetration due to their novelty. Although we develop new products with the input of our customers, which has contributed to the early success of BOHA!, customer acceptance is never assured and may take time to materialize. Further, technological innovation often results in unintended consequences such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and other system failures. Any such bug, vulnerability, or failure, especially in connection with a significant technical implementation or change, could result in lost business, harm to our brand or reputation, consumer complaints, and other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe rely on an unrelated third party to develop, maintain and host certain portions of our food service technology software, and any disruption in the relationship with that third party, or any defects in the software provided by that third party, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely upon third-party developed software and hosting services combined with our own proprietary hardware and software to offer our unique BOHA! branded solution to support back-of-house operations in the food service industry. Certain web-based food service application software and selected components of our downloadable software applications are licensed from a third-party developer on a non-exclusive basis through 2031 and are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with the developer. We are reliant upon the third-party developer to further develop and maintain their developed software, and the developer controls the software source code. Therefore, presently, we are highly dependent on this third-party developer for continued service to our customers and the further development of our food service technology software products. If the software provider were to terminate operations or otherwise be unavailable to provide maintenance, hosting and development services to us and our customers, the availability or usage of our software products could be disrupted and our customers could be adversely affected. In any such case, we may need to seek comparable software and services from other third parties or develop it internally, which could require significant time and expense. There can be no assurance that such software or services would be available from other sources, or that if available, it would be of comparable quality and cost. Moreover, any efforts to develop new software, whether internal or by third parties, would require significant lead time, and there could be an interruption in service during any period in which the software provider ceases to provide products and services and new products remain under development. Any such occurrence could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny errors or defects in, or failures of, third-party software or applications could result in errors or defects in or failures of our food service technology products and services, which could be costly to correct and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations\nWe compete in highly competitive markets, which are likely to become more competitive. Competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements.\nWe face significant competition in developing and selling our printers, terminals, software, consumables and services. Our principal competitors have substantial marketing, financial, development and personnel resources. To remain competitive, we believe we must continue to provide:\n\u25cf technologically advanced products that satisfy the user demands;\n\u25cf superior customer service;\n\u25cf high levels of quality and reliability; and\n\u25cf dependable and efficient distribution networks.\nWe cannot ensure we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors. Increased competition may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share, and could require increased spending on research and development, sales and marketing and customer support. Some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products, which may include relationships with our software developer. Any of these factors could reduce our earnings.\nOur success will depend on our ability to sustain and manage growth.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue a growth strategy. Assuming this growth occurs, it will require the expansion of customer relationships in international markets, the successful development and marketing of new products for our existing and new markets, expanded internal sales and marketing, customer service and support, and the continued implementation and improvement of our operational, financial and management information systems.\nTo the extent that we seek growth through acquisitions, our ability to manage our growth will also depend on our ability to integrate businesses that have previously operated independently. We may not be able to achieve this integration without encountering difficulties or experiencing the loss of key employees, customers or suppliers. It may be difficult to design and implement effective financial controls for combined operations and differences in existing controls for each business may result in weaknesses that require remediation when the financial controls and reporting functions are combined. As we pursue acquisitions, we may incur legal, accounting and other transaction related expenses for unsuccessful acquisition attempts that could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy, or that we can successfully manage expanded operations, if they occur. As we expand, we may from time to time experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion. Failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting have been identified, and if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified report thereon, we could be materially adversely affected.\nMaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 regarding our internal controls over user access to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user access to appropriate personnel. Specifically, the provisioning and user recertification controls are not designed to ensure users maintain proper segregation of duties and therefore could have inappropriate access rights. Additionally, we identified a material weakness in controls over key spreadsheets supporting our accounting records as of December 2018 and 2019. Specifically, we did not design adequate controls to address the completeness and accuracy of information included in key spreadsheets. During 2020, we remediated the material weakness related to the provisioning and user recertification controls, but the material weakness related to key spreadsheets still exists as of December 31, 2020. As a result of the remaining key spreadsheet material weaknesses, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020.\nUnless and until the material weakness has been remediated or should new material weaknesses arise or be discovered in the future, a material misstatement could occur and go undetected in our interim or annual consolidated financial statements. As a result, we may experience delays in fulfilling our reporting obligations or complying with federal securities laws, which could result in investigations and sanctions by regulatory authorities, including, but not limited to, the SEC, and may result in defaults or accelerations under our credit facility in the event that we are unable to timely file reports with the SEC, to the extent that in such an event, we are unable to obtain waivers from our lender. Any of these results could adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nWe are dependent on sales to one large customer; the loss of this customer or reduction in orders from this customer could materially affect our sales.\nCasino and gaming sales and lottery spare part sales to IGT represent a material percentage of our net sales. A reduction, delay or cancellation in orders from this customer, including reductions or delays due to market, economic, or competitive conditions in the industries in which we serve, could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to general economic conditions. Uncertainty or negative trends in U.S. or international economic and investment climates, including the impact of Brexit and recent developments in U.S.-China trade relations (discussed separately below), could adversely affect our business. For example, customers or potential customers could reduce or delay orders, key suppliers could become insolvent, which could result in production delays, and our customers may become insolvent or be unable to obtain credit. Any of these possible effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables, create unabsorbed costs due to lower net sales, and ultimately decrease our net sales and profitability including write-downs of assets.\nFluctuations in oil and gas prices could adversely affect drilling and exploration activities by oil and gas companies and our revenue in our Printrex market. If oil and gas prices remain volatile, or if oil or gas prices decline, the demand for our Printrex products could be adversely affected.\nThe demand for our Printrex products depends on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for drilling and exploratory activities, which are affected by short-term and long-term trends in oil and gas prices, including current and anticipated oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices, as well as the level of drilling and exploration, historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be highly volatile. Further, oil prices may be impacted by continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change, state regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and executive orders, regulatory actions and/or legislation that the current presidential administration may pursue in furtherance of its stated priority to address climate change. If oil and gas prices decline, or if there is a reduction in drilling and exploration activities, the demand for our Printrex products could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected, a valuation allowance may be required for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets.\nWe currently have deferred tax assets, which may be used to reduce taxable income in the future. We assess the realization of these deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, and if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of these assets will not be realized, an income tax valuation allowance is recorded. If market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected, or there is a change to applicable tax rules, future assessments may result in a determination that it is more likely than not that some or all of our net deferred tax assets are not realizable. As a result, we may need to establish a valuation allowance for all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on distributors and resellers to sell our products and services.\nWe use a variety of distribution channels, including OEMs and distributors, to market and sell our products and services. We may be adversely impacted by any conflicts that could arise between and among our various sales channels.\nOur dependence upon distributors and resellers exposes us to numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf loss of channel and the ability to bring new products to market;\n\u25cf concentration of credit risk, including disruption in distribution should the distributors and / or resellers\u2019 financial condition deteriorate;\n\u25cf reduced visibility to end user demand and pricing issues which makes forecasting more difficult;\n\u25cf distributors or resellers leveraging their buying power to change the terms of pricing, payment and product delivery schedules; and\n\u25cf direct competition should a distributor or reseller decide to manufacture printers internally or source printers from a competitor.\nWe cannot guarantee that resellers will not reduce, delay or eliminate purchases from us, which could have a material adverse effect upon the business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent upon two manufacturers located in China and Thailand for the manufacturing and assembly of our printers and terminals, and their operations were disrupted by the outbreak of COVID-19. The disruption adversely affected the Company\u2019s business, financial conditions and results of operations, and any further or future disruption in their businesses or operations, such as those caused by political, social or economic instability, trade restrictions or tariffs, severe weather, additional public health crises and other events out of our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn an effort to achieve additional cost savings and operation benefits, we have outsourced substantially all of the manufacturing and assembly of our printers and terminals to two contract manufacturers located in China and Thailand. As a result, we are dependent on them for the manufacturing of our products, and any disruption in such manufacturing or the export of products from these manufacturers to the U.S. may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks affecting the businesses and operations of our two manufacturers in Asia include: political and regional strife; war; labor shortages; severe weather and natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, and floods; lengthy power outages; increased pricing, financial instability and capacity constraints of shippers; and concerns with or threats of public health crises, contagious diseases or health epidemics. The risk to our business posed by any disruption in manufacturing is exacerbated by the concentration of our manufacturing operations in two manufacturers both located in Asia.\nIn response to COVID-19, the Chinese government placed restrictions on travel and mandated business closures. Such restrictions and closures disrupted our supply chain by delaying product shipments from our contract manufacturers during 2020.\nThe ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak and any resurgences, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and newly identified strains, the rollout and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments and the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, among others. Without the contract manufacturers continuing to manufacture our products and the continuing operation of the contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities, we will have limited means for the final assembly of a majority of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility, which could be costly and time consuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nWe may also incur increased business continuity and reputational risks to the extent that we continue to outsource the manufacturing and assembly of our products to foreign third-party service providers. For example, outsourcing of manufacturing prevents us from exercising control over the assembly of certain of our products and related operations or processes, including the internal controls associated with operations and processes conducted and the quality of our products assembled by contract manufacturers. If we are unable to effectively manage and oversee our outsourcing strategy, we may not realize cost structure efficiencies and our operating and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Outsourcing also exposes us to increased risk of infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property, to which our manufacturers have access. Because our manufacturers are located in Asia, there is no guarantee that our intellectual property rights will be protected or enforced to the same extent as under U.S. federal and state laws. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third-parties from developing or selling products made using our technologies.\nOverestimates or underestimates in our manufacturing forecasts could cause us to hold excess inventory or result in delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our products, which could cause us to lose orders or customers.\nIf we fail to predict our manufacturing requirements accurately, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays, which could cause us to lose orders or customers and result in lower net sales. We currently use a rolling 12-month forecast based primarily on our anticipated product orders and our product order history to help determine our requirements for components and materials. It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead-time required to obtain the necessary components and raw materials.\nLead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, the size of the order, contract terms, and demand for each component at a given time. If we underestimate our requirements, we may have inadequate manufacturing capacity or inventory, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and net sales. If we overestimate our requirements, we could have excess inventory of parts and finished products. In addition, delays in the manufacturing of our products could cause us to lose orders or customers.\nWe purchase component parts and consumable products from third-party and sole source suppliers, and any interference with this supply chain may impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products.\nWe rely on third-party or sole source suppliers to provide certain key components for our products including BOHA! labels. We do not have guaranteed supply contracts with any of our component suppliers, and our suppliers could delay shipments, increase prices or cease manufacturing or selling such components to us at any time. A disruption in the supply of such component parts and consumable products could delay our production and/or the release of our new products and hinder our ability to meet our commitments to customers. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, or if we are unable to obtain alternative sources for the components, sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products. Any of these events could result in lost sales, reduced gross margins or damage to our end-customer relationships, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nIn addition to maintaining offices in the UK and Macau, we sell and ship a significant portion of our products internationally and rely on third parties that make up our global salesforce. The international nature of our operations may expose us to certain risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S., including risks posed by the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, tariffs, and changes in trade relations.\nWe sell a significant amount of our products to customers outside the United States. Shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales. In addition, our manufacturers and suppliers are largely located in Asia. As a result, our products are largely exported to one of our facilities in the United States, which makes our operations vulnerable to disruptions in trade that could adversely affect our business results.\nOur international operations, including our reliance on manufacturers and suppliers located in Asia, our worldwide sales team, and our sales to customers located outside the United States, expose us to disruptions in trade and other associated risks such as:\n\u25cf the imposition of additional duties, tariffs, quotas, taxes, trade barriers, capital flow restrictions and other charges on imports and exports by the United States or the governments of the countries in which we or our manufacturers and suppliers operate;\n\u25cf delays in the delivery of cargo due to port security considerations, labor disputes such as dock strikes, and our reliance on a limited number of shipping and air carriers, which may experience capacity issues that adversely affect our ability to ship inventory in a timely manner or for an acceptable cost;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies, which could restrict sales, or increase costs of purchasing, in foreign countries;\n\u25cf economic or political instability in any of the countries in which we or our manufacturers or suppliers operate, which could result in a reduction in demand for our products due to political and economic instability or impair our foreign assets;\n\u25cf a reduced ability or inability to sell in or purchase from certain markets as a result of export or import restrictions;\n\u25cf potentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries, such as China, may limit recourse against infringing products or cause us to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories;\n\u25cf reliance on a limited number of shipping and air carriers who may experience capacity issues that adversely affect our ability to ship inventory in a timely manner or for an acceptable cost; and\n\u25cf economic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions (including inflation and recession).\nAlthough we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits in an amount we consider adequate, this insurance does not cover all possible situations. In addition, the business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact, both short-term and long-term, on relations with our existing customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them.\nOur business could be adversely affected by actual or threatened terrorist attacks or the related heightened security measures, military actions and other efforts to combat terrorism.\nOur business could be adversely affected by actual or threatened terrorist attacks or the related heightened security measures, military actions and other efforts to combat terrorism. It is possible that terrorist attacks could be directed at important locations for the gaming industry. Heightened security measures and other efforts to combat terrorism may also have an adverse effect on the gaming industry by reducing tourism. Any of these developments could also negatively affect the general economy and consumer confidence. Any downturn in the economy in general, or in the gaming industry in particular could result in a reduced demand for our products and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, heightened security measures may cause certain governments to restrict the import or export of goods, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to buy and sell goods.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of which could materially impact our business.\nOur future success will depend in significant part upon the continued service of certain key management and other personnel and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, technical and sales and marketing personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recruit and retain such personnel. The loss of either Bart C. Shuldman, the Company\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, or Steven A. DeMartino, the Company\u2019s President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, or the loss of certain groups of key employees, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our reputation, damage our business or interfere with our competitive position, and infringement on the intellectual property rights of others, or claims thereof, could put us at a competitive disadvantage, and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly.\nOur intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages. Copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, technology licensing agreements, nondisclosure agreements and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of our products or, without authorization, to obtain and use information which we regard as trade secrets.\nIn addition, prosecuting and defending infringement lawsuits is very expensive. We are committed to aggressively asserting and defending our technology and related intellectual property rights, which we have spent a significant amount of money to develop. Similarly, third-parties may claim, from time to time, that we have violated their intellectual property rights. To the extent of a violation of a third-party\u2019s patent or other intellectual property right, we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and may be required to pay damages, to obtain a license, if available, or to use a non-infringing method, if possible, to accomplish our objectives. Any such claims could result in costly litigation and, if successful, could result in costly judgments or settlements.\nThe expense of prosecuting or defending any future infringement lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Intellectual property litigation is generally complex, costly, protracted, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel.\nWe currently rely on third-party service providers to host our food service technology software and deliver certain services, and any interruptions or delays in services from these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and services, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on a third-party service provider to host our food service technology software. Third parties also provide services to key aspects of our operations, including Internet connections and networking, data storage and processing, trust and safety and security infrastructure. We do not control the operation, physical security, or data security of any of these third-party providers. Our efforts to use commercially reasonable diligence in the selection and retention of such third-party providers may be insufficient or inadequate to prevent or remediate such operational and security risks. Our third-party providers may be subject to intrusions, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism or other misconduct. They are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events, and they may be subject to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, each of which may impose additional costs or requirements on us or prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers on our behalf. In addition, these third parties may breach their agreements with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail to or refuse to process transactions or provide other services adequately, take actions that degrade the functionality of our platform and services, increase prices, impose additional costs or requirements on us or our customers, or give preferential treatment to our competitors. If we are unable to procure alternatives in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be subject to business disruptions, losses, or costs to remediate any of these deficiencies. The occurrence of any of the above events could result in reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, loss of customers or other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur food service technology business depends substantially on our customers renewing their subscriptions with the Company. Any decline in our customer renewals would harm our food service technology business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur subscription offerings are term-based, and in order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions with us when the existing subscription term expires and renew on the same or more favorable quantity and terms. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions and we may not be able to accurately predict customer renewal rates. Customers may elect not to renew their subscriptions with us for a variety of reasons, including as a result of changes in their strategic priorities, budgets and costs and, in some instances, due to competing solutions. Our retention rate may also decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including our customers\u2019 satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solutions, the increase in the contract value of subscription and support contracts from new customers, the effectiveness of our customer support services, our pricing, the prices of competing products or services, global economic conditions and the other risk factors described herein. As a result, there can be no assurance that our food service technology customers will renew subscriptions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or renew on less favorable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to offer high quality support, our business and reputation could suffer.\nOur customers rely on us and our third-party service providers for support of our software and services included in our food service technology subscription packages. High-quality support is important for the renewal and expansion of our agreements with existing customers. The importance of high-quality support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers. If we or our third-party service providers do not help our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell new food service technology products to existing and new customers could suffer and our reputation and relationships with existing or potential customers could be harmed.\nCyber-security and privacy breaches, cyber-attacks, or other disruptions could expose us to liability, affect our business, and damage our reputation.\nWe are increasingly dependent on our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We collect, store, and transmit sensitive information including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information in connection with business operations. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Some of this information could be an attractive target of criminal attack by third parties with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, disgruntled current or former employees, and others. Cyber-attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication, and despite our extensive security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to such attacks or may be breached, including due to employee error or malfeasance. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. If our systems become compromised, we may not promptly discover the intrusion. Like other companies in our industry, we have experienced attacks to our data and systems, including malware and computer viruses that we have been able to detect and eliminate. If our systems fail or are breached or disrupted, we could lose product sales, and suffer reputational damage and loss of customer confidence. Such incidents would require notification to affected individuals and may result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Any one of these events could cause our business to be materially harmed and our results of operations to be adversely impacted.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that current laws, or any laws enacted in the future, will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in such laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nThe agreement governing our credit facility contains restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity.\nThe loan and security agreement (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) governing the Siena Credit Facility contains a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity, and our results of operations. These covenants restrict, among other things, our ability, and the ability of any future domestic subsidiary, to:\n\u25cf merge, consolidate, form subsidiaries or dispose of assets;\n\u25cf acquire assets outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u25cf enter into other transactions outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u25cf sell, transfer, return or dispose of collateral;\n\u25cf make loans to or investments in, or enter into transactions with, affiliates;\n\u25cf incur or guarantee indebtedness, incur liens;\n\u25cf redeem equity interests while borrowings are outstanding under the credit facility;\n\u25cf change our capital structure; or;\n\u25cf dissolve, divide, change our line of business or cease or suffer a disruption to all or a material portion of our business.\nAdditionally, the Loan Agreement requires us to comply with a minimum EBITDA covenant, the amount of which is based on financial forecasts provided to the lender. The breach of any covenants or obligations in the Loan Agreement, if not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the Loan Agreement and could trigger acceleration of our obligations thereunder and permit the lender to foreclose on the collateral securing our obligations under the Loan Agreement and exercise other rights of secured creditors.\nAvailability under the Siena Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline in value, our borrowing base will decrease, and the availability under the Siena Credit Facility currently is and may continue to be less than its stated amount and may decrease. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, we are required to prepay borrowings and/or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants under the Loan Agreement or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control, including deteriorating economic conditions and consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. For example, the minimum EBITDA covenant, as applicable to periods through March 31, 2021, is based on financial projections prepared before most COVID-19-related operating restrictions were put in place in the United States, and our actual EBITDA for any of those periods may be substantially less than projected in such forecasts. In such event, we may not be able to comply with the covenant. In addition, reductions in the value of accounts receivable and inventory have occurred and are likely to continue to occur due to decreases in sales and production that have occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, certain slow-moving inventory and accounts receivable that remain unpaid for a specified period of time are excluded from the borrowing base calculation. Thus, a decline in economic conditions and/or a decline in the financial condition of customers in the industries we serve, such as the decline that has occurred in the casino and food service industries in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, has impacted and may continue to negatively impact the borrowing base both by decreasing the value of existing accounts and reducing the number and amount of new accounts. If we overestimate our inventory needs due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the duration of its impact on customer closures and economic conditions, we may have inventory that is considered slow-moving and thus excluded from the borrowing base calculation, and any reduction in production in response to decreased demand would also result in a lower inventory value and thus a lower borrowing base.\nAny of these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We cannot assure you that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained, or if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us, or that we would be able to reduce expenditures enough to offset any decrease in the borrowing base, or that we could make such reductions without a material negative impact on our business.\nWe may not be entitled to forgiveness of our PPP Loan.\nOn May 1, 2020, the Company was granted the $2.2 million PPP Loan. The PPP Loan is unsecured and is evidenced by a note a dated the Loan Date (the \u201cNote\u201d) issued by the Company in favor of Berkshire Bank, as the lender (the \u201cPPP Lender\u201d). The Note has a two-year term. The PPP provides for forgiveness of up to the full amount borrowed as long as the Company uses the loan proceeds during the covered period following disbursement for eligible purposes as described in the CARES Act and related guidance. Under the CARES Act, loan forgiveness is generally available to the extent the PPP Loan was used, during the covered period, for payroll costs and costs to continue group health care benefits, as well as for interest on mortgage obligations incurred before February 15, 2020, rent under lease agreements in effect before February 15, 2020, utilities for which service began before February 15, 2020, and interest on debt obligations incurred before February 15, 2020 (\u201cqualifying expenses\u201d), subject to conditions and limitations provided in the CARES Act. We maximized usage of the proceeds from the PPP Loan for qualifying expenses during the applicable period. As of the date of this filing, we have not yet submitted an application for forgiveness.\nUnder the revised rules for the PPP, if we submit a forgiveness application within 10 months after the end of the covered period, we will not have to begin principal and interest payments before the date on which the SBA remits the loan forgiveness amount to the PPP Lender (or notifies the PPP Lender that no loan forgiveness is allowed). If no loan forgiveness is allowed, the Company will be required to pay the PPP Lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest based on the principal amount outstanding on the PPP Loan, plus interest outstanding at the end of the deferment period, and taking into account any reductions in the principal amount due to forgiveness, if any. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be eligible for loan forgiveness or that any amount of the PPP Loan will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors, such as:\n\u25cf prevailing domestic and international market and economic conditions, and conditions in the industries we serve, including current market volatility and the economic impact of COVID-19 and resulting shutdowns on the casino and food service industries and on the U.S. and global economies;\n\u25cf adverse business conditions faced by customers, or bankruptcies or store closures of our customers resulting from adverse economic conditions due to COVID-19 or otherwise;\n\u25cf changes in our business, operations or prospects;\n\u25cf developments in our relationships with our customers or strategic partners;\n\u25cf announcements of new products or services by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf announcement or completion of acquisitions by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in existing or adoption of additional government regulations; and\n\u25cf unfavorable or reduced analyst coverage.\nIn addition, the stock market may experience significant price fluctuations year-to-year. Broad market fluctuations, general economic conditions and specific conditions in the industries in which we operate may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nLimited trading volume and a reduction in analyst coverage of our common stock may contribute to its price volatility.\nThe limited trading volume of our common stock may contribute to its price volatility. The trading market for our common stock also relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts may publish about us, our business, our markets and our competitors. We currently have limited analyst coverage. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock in the future, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business, our stock price may decline.\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market. During the year ended December 31, 2020 the average daily trading volume for our common stock as reported by the Nasdaq Global Market was approximately 29,000 shares. We are uncertain whether a more active trading market in our common stock will develop. In addition, many investment banks no longer find it profitable to provide securities research on micro-cap and small-cap companies. As a result, relatively small trades may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, which could increase the volatility and depress the price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is thinly traded, and investors may be unable to sell their shares at their desired prices, or at all, and sales of large blocks of shares may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur common stock has historically been sporadically or \u201cthinly traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing shares of our common stock at prevailing prices at any given time may be relatively small. This could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. Investors may be unable to sell their common stock at or above their purchase price, which may result in substantial losses. As a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of shares of our common stock in either direction. The price of shares of our common stock could, for example, decline precipitously in the event a large number of shares of our common stock are sold on the market without commensurate demand, while an issuer with a more robust daily trading volume for its common stock might better absorb those sales without an adverse impact on its share price.\nIf we raise additional capital in the future, existing shareholder ownership interest in the Company could be diluted or otherwise adversely impacted, and future sales of our common stock or other financing arrangements may cause our stock price to decline.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock in public or private offerings, or we may obtain funds through a credit facility or by issuing debt or preferred securities. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock to finance future acquisitions. Shares of our common stock are also available for future issuance and sale pursuant to stock options and other equity awards that we have granted to our employees, and in the future, we may grant additional stock options, restricted stock units and other forms of equity compensation to our employees. Any issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline, or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past, which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive. Sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings. The lenders under our existing debt agreements have rights that are senior to your rights as a common stockholder, and if we obtain funds in the future through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities, the lenders of such facility or the holders of such securities would likely also have rights senior to the rights of our common stockholders, which could impair the value of our common stock.\nWe take advantage of specified scaled disclosure requirements applicable to a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under Regulation S-K, and the information that we provide to stockholders may therefore be different than they might receive from other public companies. If some investors find our shares of common stock less attractive as a result of this scaled disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our shares of common stock, which may increase the volatility of the market price of our common stock.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. As a smaller reporting company, we take advantage of specified scaled disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies.\nWe intend to continue to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosure requirements of smaller reporting companies and may continue to do so until we are no longer a smaller reporting company. We will cease to be a smaller reporting company if we have (i) more than $250 million in market value of our shares held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter or (ii) more than $100 million of annual revenues in our most recent fiscal year completed before the last business day of our second fiscal quarter and a market value of our shares held by non-affiliates more than $700 million as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. We choose to take advantage of some but not all of these scaled disclosure requirements; therefore, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than one might get from other public companies. Further, if some investors find our shares of common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our shares of common stock and the market price of such shares of common stock may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 83910, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "TACT"}
