{"cik": "1353487", "company": "TARONIS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere can be no assurance that we can achieve or maintain profitability.\nAs a small business, we encounter problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays that may affect our ability to become profitable. As a result, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to operate and grow in the manner desired.\nOur ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow will be dependent upon, among other things:\n\u25cf our ability to raise capital on favorable terms in order to operate and grow our business;\n\u25cf management\u2019s ability to maintain the technology and skills necessary to operate our business;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain awareness of regulatory updates by government agencies and changes in the law, particularly in the areas of product transportation, handling and compliance and environmental regulation;\n\u25cf our ability to attract customers who require the products and services we offer;\n\u25cf our ability to generate revenues through the sale of our products and services to potential clients; and\n\u25cf our ability to manage the logistics and operations of our Company and the distribution of our products and services.\nWe have had operating losses since formation and expect to incur net losses for the near term.\nWe reported a net loss of $15,036,843 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to a net loss of $11,024,388 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. We currently spend approximately $785,000 per month to fund our operations. We anticipate that we will continue to lose money in the near term and we may not be able to achieve profitable operations. In order to achieve profitable operations, we may need to raise additional capital in the near term to maintain current operations.\nOur financial statements for December 31, 2018 include a disclosure that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a history of losses since inception. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred a net loss of $15,036,843, and had an accumulated deficit of $79,619,711. We expect to continue to incur operating and net losses for the foreseeable future as we operate our business; expand our sales and marketing efforts; expand our retail distribution network; invest in product development and establish the necessary administrative functions to support our growing operations and being a public company. Our losses in future periods may be greater than the losses we would incur if we developed the business more slowly. In addition, we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in increases in our revenues, which would further increase our losses. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue operations in the future as a going concern, as disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. Although our financial statements raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, they do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue our business. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in our company.\nWe will likely need to secure additional funding to continue operations in order to continue as a going concern, which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.\nTo date, we have not achieved positive cash flows or profitability, and therefore we will likely need raise additional capital or incur debt to fund our operations in order to continue as a going concern. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as we incur costs associated with business operations, the pursuit of potential acquisitions, continuation of our research and development programs, expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities, increased manufacturing of our products, and compliance with the requirements related to being a U.S. public company listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result, additional funding will likely be needed and it may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. However, if we are unable to improve our liquidity position, we may not be able to continue as a going concern. If we secure additional funding through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders may suffer dilution and our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future income may be limited. If we obtain funding through the issuance of debt secured by the Company\u2019s assets, stockholders may not receive any liquidation value related to the Company\u2019s assets if a lender forecloses on the assets as a result of a non-cured event of default. We may also be required to accept terms that include investor rights that may be restrictive to our business. Unfavorable terms may also include features that may create further dilution, such as warrants, anti-dilution features, price resets and other similar toxic features. These types of features may make equity financing more dilutive, but may also create additional, compound dilution in connection with future financings as well. If we raise additional funding through debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, require us to use our cash to make payments under such indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. If we are unable to secure additional funding, our commercialization efforts would be delayed, reduced or eliminated, our relationships with our suppliers and customers may be harmed, and we may not be able to continue our operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern and, therefore, be required to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities other than in the normal course of business which could cause investors to suffer the loss of all or a substantial portion of their investment.\nThe growth of our business depends upon the development and successful commercial acceptance of our products.\nSuccessful commercialization of MagneGas and our commercialization of the Plasma Arc Flow System for sterilization and decontamination depends on timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing processes and effective sales, marketing and customer service. Because of the complexity of our products, significant delays may occur between development, introduction to the market and volume production phases.\nWidescale commercialization of the MagneGas fuel and the commercial launch of the Plasma Arc Flow System for sterilization and decontamination, may involve many difficulties, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf retention and hiring of appropriate operational, research and development personnel;\n\u25cf determination of the products\u2019 technical specifications;\n\u25cf successful completion of the development process;\n\u25cf successful marketing of MagneGas, resulting in customer acceptance;\n\u25cf successful implementation of our Plasma Arc Flow System for commercial decontamination and sterilization;\n\u25cf regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf managing inventory levels, logistics and operations; and\n\u25cf additional customer service and warranty costs associated with supporting product modifications and/or subsequent potential field upgrades.\nWe must expend significant financial and management resources to develop and market MagneGas and our Plasma Arc Flow System. We cannot assure that we will receive meaningful revenue from these investments. If we are unable to continue to successfully develop or modify our products in response to customer requirements or technological changes, or our products are not commercially successful, our business may be harmed.\nAcquisitions constitute a key aspect of our growth strategy and failure to successfully integrate newly acquired companies or businesses could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe invested significant capital into acquisitions and these acquisitions comprised a substantial component of our growth in the year ending December 31, 2018. We will likely continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies or their business assets in the future. There can be no assurance that these transactions will be consummated or that, if consummated, will be successful from an integration or financial perspective. Further, if we complete acquisitions, we face many associated risks, including:\n\u25cf\nincurring significantly higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses;\n\u25cf\nfailing to assimilate the operations, customers and personnel of the acquired company or business;\n\u25cf\ndisrupting our ongoing business;\n\u25cf\ndissipating our management resources;\n\u25cf\ndilution to existing stockholders and stock price decline from the issuance of equity securities;\n\u25cf\nliabilities or other problems associated with the acquired business;\n\u25cf\nincurring debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;\n\u25cf\nbecoming subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges;\n\u25cf\nimproper compliance with laws of foreign jurisdictions;\n\u25cf\nfailing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies; and\n\u25cf\nimpairing relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management.\nFully integrating an acquired company or business assets into our operations may take a significant amount of time. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions. To the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems related to any acquisition, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Future acquisitions also could impact our financial position and capital needs and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly results of operations. Acquisitions could include significant goodwill and intangible assets, which may result in future impairment charges that would reduce our stated earnings.\nEscalating trade tensions and the adoption or expansion of tariffs and trade restrictions could negatively impact us.\nThe U.S. government has recently announced tariffs on steel and aluminum products and materials imported into the United States and has signaled a willingness to impose tariffs on other products. Various countries and economic regions have announced plans or intentions to impose retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of products they import from the United States. These newly imposed or threatened U.S. tariffs and retaliatory tariffs could have the effect of increasing the cost of materials for our products, which could result in our products becoming less competitive or generating lower margins. The tariffs could also result in disruptions to our supply chain, as suppliers struggle to fill orders from companies trying to purchase goods in bulk ahead of announced tariffs. Finally, many of our customers also operate in industries that are vulnerable to harm from imposition of tariffs and these customers may be unable to stay solvent as a result of the tariffs, which would negatively impact our sales.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes following the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe recently formed a wholly owned subsidiary, MagneGas Limited, which is based in London, England, for the purpose of directly applying for grants and government-backed financing as a European entity. The United Kingdom invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on March 29, 2017, initiating the process to leave the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), which is currently scheduled to occur on April 12, 2019. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. Given the ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the form of Brexit (including a potential \u201chard Brexit\u201d in which the United Kingdom would also give up full access to the European Union single market and customs union), we cannot predict how the Brexit process will finally be implemented and are continuing to assess the potential impact, if any, on our ability to seek grants and government-backed financing as a European entity.\nCertain purchasers of common stock from certain institutional investors may have claims against us and/or the institutional investors under Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act.\nIn June 2017 we sold to investors warrants to purchase our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) in a private placement. The warrants were exercisable into Preferred Stock which was, itself, convertible into our common stock. In connection with the private placement, we granted certain registration rights to the investors. Pursuant to these rights, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (the \u201cResale S-3\u201d). In the Resale S-3, we registered for resale all of the securities issued in the June 2017 private placement, including the relevant warrants, Preferred Stock and common stock issuable on conversion of the Preferred Stock. We paid the registration fee in full for such resales. Pursuant to SEC staff guidance, we registered for resale by investors 3,560,714 shares of common stock, which was the maximum number of shares issuable at such time pursuant to the conversion of the Preferred Stock. The Resale S-3 was declared effective on September 14, 2017.\nOn January 16, 2018, we effected a 1-for-15 reverse stock split of our common stock, which did not affect our Preferred Stock or the conversion rate of our Preferred Stock. According to SEC staff guidance, by operation of Rule 416 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), the number of common stock shares available for resale under the Resale S-3 was automatically reduced in proportion to the reverse stock split. Pursuant to such guidance, in order to register for resale all of the shares of common stock issuable on conversion of the Preferred Stock, we were required to file an additional registration statement. We were not aware of the SEC staff guidance and inadvertently did not file a new resale registration statement covering the additional shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock.\nAfter we became aware of the SEC staff guidance, we filed a resale registration statement on Form S-3 on October 29, 2018, which covered the resale of the remaining shares issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, which was declared effective on November 6, 2018. Between March 2018, when the investors sold the maximum number of shares registered in the Resale S-3, as adjusted by the reverse stock split, and November 6, 2018, approximately 3,150,000 shares were sold in unregistered transactions by two institutional investors without an exemption from registration. Consequently, certain purchasers of common stock from these two institutional investors may have claims against us or the institutional investors under Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act, which, upon appropriate proof, may entitle them to recover the consideration paid for such shares with interest thereon, less the amount of any income received thereon, upon the tender of the shares, or damages if they no longer own the shares. Section 13 of the Securities Act requires that any such claim be brought within one year of the violation. While we have not received notice of any such claim to-date and have not qualified any potential liability, we will still be subject to such claims until the end of the one-year period following the applicable violation, which may have occurred as late as November 6, 2018.\nOur business strategy includes growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nOver the course of our business development as a clean technology company, we have established a retail and wholesale platform and network of brokers to sell our synthetic gas for use in the metalworking and manufacturing industries. Our business strategy includes continued expansion of this network by way of acquisitions and organic growth. Recently, to further our strategy, we made changes to our executive management team, including a new chief executive officer and interim financial officer. Our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including the ability of these executive officers to execute our business strategy.\nGrowth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Furthermore, there are considerable costs involved in acquiring companies and expanding retail capacity, and generally a period of time is required to generate the necessary revenues to offset these costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. Accordingly, any such business expansion can be expected to negatively impact our earnings until certain economies of scale are reached.\nWe are currently not in compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements. If we do not regain compliance and continue to meet Nasdaq listing requirements, our Common Stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which could affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock and reduce our ability to raise additional capital.\nOn May 7, 2018, we received a notice from Nasdaq indicating that the Common Stock was subject to potential delisting from Nasdaq because for a period of 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of the Common Stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cBid Price Rule\u201d). The notification had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Common Stock on Nasdaq. Nasdaq stated in its letter that in accordance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, the Company was being provided with an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until November 5, 2018, to regain compliance. On November 6, 2018, the Company was informed by Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff that the Company\u2019s request for an additional 180-day period to regain compliance, or until May 6, 2019, was granted. To regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule, the bid price of the Common Stock must close at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days and the Company must meet all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market. Although the Company effected the Reverse Stock Split as of January 30, 2019 at 5 p.m. Eastern Time, the price of our Common Stock subsequently fell below $1.00 due to uncontrollable market conditions prior to having traded above $1.00 for the minimum ten consecutive business days required to regain compliance. We may need to seek another reverse stock split in order to increase our stock price, however there is no guarantee that Nasdaq will continue to allow us to regain compliance in this manner. If the Company fails to regain compliance during the second 180-day period, or by May 6, 2019, then Nasdaq will notify the Company of its determination to delist the Company\u2019s Common Stock, at which point the Company would have an opportunity to appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel.\nIn addition, on December 13, 2018, the Company convened and thereafter adjourned its annual meeting of stockholders due to an inability to achieve a quorum as specified in the Company\u2019s bylaws. While we have not received a notice from Nasdaq, it is likely that our inability to achieve a quorum may be seen as a failure to hold an annual meeting within 12 months of the end of our last fiscal year (the \u201cAnnual Meeting Requirement\u201d). In order to maintain our Nasdaq listing, we may need to create a plan of compliance to submit to Nasdaq for review and hold another annual meeting. However, there can be no assurance that Nasdaq will accept our plan or that we will be able to regain compliance with the Annual Meeting Requirement or maintain compliance with any other Nasdaq requirement in the future.\nIf we are unable to meet these requirements, our Common Stock could be delisted from Nasdaq. If our Common Stock were to be delisted from Nasdaq, our Common Stock could continue to trade on the OTCQB or similar marketplace. Any such delisting of our Common Stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our Common Stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equity markets. Any of these changes could cause investors to suffer the loss of all or a substantial portion of their investment.\nPending and future litigation and government investigations may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we have been subject to litigation. It is possible that we may be subject to litigation or claims for indemnification in connection with the sale of our Common Stock in inadvertent unregistered transactions that occurred in 2018. The SEC may determine to investigate the unregistered transactions in our Common Stock, which could subject us to potential enforcement actions by the SEC under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and may result in injunctive relief or the imposition of fines. In addition, it is possible that we had other unregistered offers or sales of our Common Stock, other than the aforementioned inadvertent unregistered transactions that occurred in 2018, and we may be subject to litigation or claims for indemnification in connection with any such offers or sales. If any such claims were to succeed, we might not have sufficient funds to pay the resulting damages. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain would cover any such expenses or be sufficient to cover any claims against us. In addition to the monetary value of any claim, any litigation, regulatory action or governmental proceeding to which we are a party could adversely affect us by harming our reputation, diverting the time and attention of management, and causing the Company to incur significant litigation expenses, which would all materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, we may be a party to litigation matters involving our business, which operates within a highly regulated industry. On September 4, 2018, we received notice that a law firm representing the estate of an individual who sustained life-ending injuries while working for an end user of our products had made a claim to our insurance carrier. The matter is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration. The Company is still investigating the cause of the accident and there have been no conclusive findings as of this time. It is unknown whether the final cause of the accident will be determined and whether those findings will negatively impact Company operations or sales. The Company continues to be fully operational and transparent with all regulatory agencies.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings as we are required to reassess our goodwill or other intangible assets arising from acquisitions.\nWe are required under U.S. GAAP to review our intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant a review. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization and slower or declining growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined.\nManagement has identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting and as a result we may not prevent or detect misstatements in our financial reporting.\nAs a result of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, the Company\u2019s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Management has not maintained adequate segregation of duties within the Company due to its reliance on a few individuals to fill multiple roles and responsibilities. Furthermore, the Company has limited accounting personnel to prepare its financial statements and handle complex accounting transactions. Our failure to segregate duties and the insufficiency of our accounting resources has been a material weakness for the period covering this report.\nFailure to comply with applicable government regulations could materially limit our sales opportunities and future revenue.\nFailure to obtain operating permits, or otherwise to comply with applicable federal, state and local regulatory and environmental requirements could affect our abilities to market and sell MagneGas and Plasma Arc Flow Systems and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. We and our customers may be required to comply with a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the areas of safety, health and environmental controls. To the extent we intend to market the Plasma Arc Flow System internationally, we will be required to comply with laws and regulations of various foreign jurisdictions and, when applicable, obtain permits in those other jurisdictions. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain or maintain required permits and approvals or that new or more stringent environmental regulations will not be enacted or that if they are, we will be able to meet the stricter standards.\nThe preparation of our financial statements involves the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions, and our financial statements may be materially affected if our estimates prove to be inaccurate.\nFinancial statements prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Different estimates, judgments, and assumptions reasonably could be used that would have a material effect on the financial statements, and changes in these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are likely to occur from period to period in the future. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions are inherently uncertain, and, if they prove to be wrong, then we face the risk that charges to income will be required.\nOur Plasma Arc Flow System is unproven on a large-scale industrial basis for decontamination and sterilization and could fail to perform in an industrial production environment.\nOur Plasma Arc Flow System has never been utilized on a large-scale industrial basis, i.e. scaled commercial production for decontamination and sterilization of waste streams. All of the tests that we have conducted to date with respect to our technology have been performed on limited quantities of liquid waste, and we cannot assure you that the same or similar results could be obtained on a large-scale industrial basis. We cannot predict all of the difficulties that may arise when the technology is utilized on a large-scale industrial basis. In addition, our technology has never operated at a volume level required to be profitable. It is possible that the technology may require further research, development, design and testing prior to implementation of a larger-scale commercial application. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that this technology will perform successfully on a large-scale commercial basis, that it will be profitable to us or that it will be competitive in the market.\nOur future success is dependent, in part, on the performance and continued service of our Executive Team and other key personnel. Without their continued service, we may be forced to interrupt our operations.\nWe are presently dependent to a great extent upon the experience, abilities and continued services of our Executive Team. The loss of our Executive Team or other key personnel\u2019s services may affect our business operations substantially.\nOur related party transactions may cause conflicts of interests that may adversely affect our business.\nWe have received various small notes and loans from related parties. We believe that these transactions and agreements that we have entered into with these affiliates are on terms that are at least as favorable as could reasonably have been obtained at such time from third parties. However, these relationships could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our Board is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and these affiliates. The appearance of conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialize, might adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us, as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter into new relationships in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital or to do business.\nWe face the potential risk of product liability, which may subject us to litigation and related costs.\nOur Plasma Arc Flow System may be utilized in a variety of industrial and other settings and may be used to handle materials resulting from the user\u2019s generation of liquid waste and the creation of a compressed hydrogen-based fuel for distribution to end-users. The equipment, cylinders and gas may breakdown or malfunction. Further, because of the inherent risk in the compression, transportation and use of MagneGas fuel, it is possible that claims for personal injury and business losses arising out of a breakdown or malfunction would occur. Our insurance may be insufficient to provide coverage against all claims or may not cover all claims, and claims may be made against us even if covered by our insurance policy for amounts substantially in excess of applicable policy limits. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could render us insolvent.\nBecause we are small and have fewer financial and other resources than our competitors, we may not be able to successfully compete in the industry.\nThere is significant competition in our industry. Our business faces competition from a number of producers that can produce significantly greater volumes of fuel than we can or expect to produce, producers that can produce a wider range of fuel products than we can, and producers that have the financial and other resources that would enable them to expand their production rapidly if they chose to. These producers may be able to achieve substantial economies of scale and scope, thereby substantially reducing their fixed production costs and their marginal productions costs. If these producers are able to substantially reduce their marginal production costs, the market price of fuel may decline and we may be not be able to produce or sell our products at a cost that allows us to compete economically. Further, since MagneGas is an alternative to acetylene, the unstable price of acetylene will impact our ability to become profitable and to sell cost competitive fuel. Even if we are able to operate profitably, these other producers may be substantially more profitable than us, which may make it more difficult for us to raise any financing necessary for us to achieve our business plan and may have a materially adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nCosts of compliance with burdensome or changing environmental and operational safety regulations could cause our focus to be diverted away from our business and our results of operations may suffer.\nOur business is subject to various federal and state mandated regulatory and safety requirements which are implemented by state and federal agencies. These regulations are subject to change and such changes may require additional capital expenditures or increased operating costs. Consequently, considerable resources may be required to comply with future regulations. In addition, our production facilities could be subject to nuisance or related claims by employees, property owners or residents near the facilities. Environmental and public nuisance claims, or tort claims, or increased environmental compliance costs resulting therefrom could significantly increase our operating costs.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. OSHA requires that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to employees, state and local governmental authorities, and local residents. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, process safety standards and control of occupational exposure to regulated substances, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the cash flows of the business if we are subjected to significant fines or compliance costs.\nBecause MagneGas is relatively new to the metalworking market, it may take time for the industry to adopt it.\nMagneGas competes with acetylene and other fossil-fuel based metal cutting fuels in the metalworking market. Because MagneGas is a relatively new product in the industry, it may take time for end-users to consider using MagneGas which may adversely impact our sales. A failure by the market to adopt our products quickly, or at all, will have material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the cash flows of the business.\nMergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could weaken our competitive position, which could harm our operating results.\nThere is significant competition among existing alternative fuel producers. Some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting firms or other parties. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could lead to pricing pressure and our loss of market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur failure to respond to rapid change in the market for alternative fuel products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur future success will depend significantly on our ability to create a product that is clean, effective and competitively priced. However, as technology develops generally, consumer preferences switch, government regulations and incentives change and industry standards evolve. A currently competitive product may quickly become uncompetitive. A delay in or inability to develop or acquire technological improvements, adapt the products we develop to technological changes or provide technology that appeals to our customers may preclude our ability to compete in the marketplace and could cause us to lose existing customer relationships. Such failures could lead to our insolvency.\nBecause our long-term plan depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our solutions to customers located outside of the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nWe have limited experience operating in foreign jurisdictions. We continue to explore opportunities for joint ventures internationally. Our inexperience in operating our business outside of the United States increases the risk that our current and future international expansion efforts will be unsuccessful. Conducting international operations subjects us to new risks that, generally, we have not faced in the United States, including:\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u25cf potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u25cf localization of our solutions, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u25cf the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards, including laws and regulations related to privacy;\n\u25cf increased burden in compliance with certain United States laws and regulatory schemes, including, but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and various trade controls and economic sanctions laws, regulations and policies, such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Export Administration Regulations;\n\u25cf increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u25cf political, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and\n\u25cf reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nThe success of our business depends, in part, upon proprietary technologies and information that may be difficult to protect and may infringe or be perceived to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe believe that the identification, acquisition and development of proprietary technologies are key drivers of our business. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, maintain the secrecy of our proprietary technology and information and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot guarantee that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business, that the patents that provide us with competitive advantages will not be challenged by third parties, that we will develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable or that any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages. Further, we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop similar or superior technologies, duplicate elements of our technology or design around it.\nTo commercialize our proprietary technologies successfully, we may need to acquire licenses to use, or to contest the validity of, issued or pending patents. We cannot guarantee that any license acquired under such patents would be made available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we would prevail in any such contest. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us for alleged infringement of another party\u2019s patents or in defending the validity or enforceability of our patents, or in bringing patent infringement suits against other parties based on our patents.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and technology that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our prospective joint venture partners, employees and consultants. We cannot guarantee that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that our trade secrets and proprietary know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will obtain any patent protection that we seek, that any protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable if challenged or that it will confer any significant commercial advantage. U.S. patents and patent applications may be subject to interference proceedings, U.S. patents may be subject to re-examination proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent offices, which proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application, or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of, the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, re-examination and opposition proceedings may be costly. Moreover, the U.S. patent laws may change, possibly making it easier to challenge patents. Some of our technology was, and continues to be, developed in conjunction with third parties, and thus there is a risk that such third parties may claim rights in our intellectual property. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others may provide limited or no protection against competitors. Our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties, may not result in patents being issued. If issued, they may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology.\nSeveral patents in our patent portfolio have imperfect chains of title, which could result in ownership challenges by third parties. The cost to defend against such ownership challenges or the loss of such patents could have a material adverse effect on our business, operation or financial results.\nOur patents, U.S. Patent No\u2019s. 6,183,604, 6,663,752, and 6,673,322, have defects in their original patent assignments. We have filed several nunc pro tunc assignments to correct the assignment defects for each of these patents (the \u201cCorrective Assignments\u201d). The Corrective Assignments are intended to correct the defects in earlier defective patent assignments such that each patent is valid and enforceable by us. The Corrective Assignments do not replace the assignments previously recorded at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Instead, the Corrective Assignments are intended to repair the defects in the prior patent assignments. Notwithstanding the recordation of the Corrective Assignments, the ownership of each patent may be subject to ownership challenges and the costs to defend against such ownership challenges or the loss of such patents could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.\nMany of our competitors have significant resources and incentives to apply for and obtain intellectual property rights that could limit or prevent our ability to commercialize our current or future products in the United States or abroad.\nMany of our potential competitors have significant resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies and may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products either in the United States or in international markets. Our current or future U.S. or foreign patents may be challenged, circumvented by competitors or others or may be found to be invalid, unenforceable or insufficient. Since patent applications are confidential until patents are issued in the United States, or in most cases, until after 18 months from filing of the application, or corresponding applications are published in other countries, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how. We generally seek to protect this information by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nFuture issuance of our common stock could dilute the interests of existing stockholders.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of common stock could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders. We may also be subject to or be required to accept unfavorable terms in financings, including features that may create further dilution, such as warrants, anti-dilution features, price resets and other similar features. These types of features will make such equity financings more dilutive, but may also create additional, compounded dilution in connection with future financings as well. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in an acquisition which received such common stock as consideration or by investors who acquired such common stock in a private placement, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Significant dilution will lower our stock price and could result in the loss of our Nasdaq listing.\nThe market price for our common stock is particularly volatile, which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to you.\nThe market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to the shares of larger, more established companies that have large public floats and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than the shares of such larger, more established companies for the indefinite future. The volatility in our share price is attributable to a number of factors, including the trading volume of our shares, market perception of prior dilutive equity issuances in order to raise capital, short selling and the fact that we are considered by some to be a speculative or \u201crisky\u201d investment due to our lack of profits to date and uncertainty surrounding market acceptance of our products. As a consequence, some investors may be inclined to sell their shares quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with a larger established company. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, and these fluctuations may cause the price of our securities to fall.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors that could affect our revenues or our expenses in any particular quarter. You should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance. Factors that may affect our quarterly results include:\n\u25cf our entry into mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic transactions;\n\u25cf market acceptance of our products and those of our competitors;\n\u25cf the sales and fulfillment cycle associated with our products, which is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control, and the corresponding delay in our receipt of the associated revenue;\n\u25cf our ability to complete the technical milestone tests associated with our commercial agreements;\n\u25cf our ability to attract and retain key personnel;\n\u25cf development of new designs and technologies; and\n\u25cf our ability to manage our anticipated growth and expansion.\nWe have a significant number of warrants outstanding, and while these warrants are outstanding, it may be more difficult to raise additional equity capital. Additionally, certain of these warrants contain price-protection provisions that may result in the reduction of their exercise prices if certain transactions occur in the future.\nAs of April 8, 2019, we had outstanding warrants to purchase approximately 12,819,028 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment, respectively. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital while these warrants are outstanding. At any time during which these warrants are likely to be exercised, we may be unable to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms from other sources. Furthermore, the majority of the warrants contain price-protection provisions under which, if we were to issue securities in conjunction with a merger, tender offer, sale of assets or reclassification of our common stock at a price lower than the exercise price of such warrants, the exercise price of the warrants would be reduced, with certain exceptions, to the lower price. Additionally, the exercise of the warrants will cause the increase of our outstanding shares of our common stock, which could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders.\nWe no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we will be required to comply with certain provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act and can no longer take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as we were an emerging growth company, we were permitted to take advantage of reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. These included, without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments. As we are no longer an emerging growth company, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nThe price of shares of our common stock may not reflect our value and there can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock now or in the future.\nThe price of our common stock, when traded, may not reflect our true value. We cannot guarantee that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. Market liquidity will depend, among other things, on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to bring us to the awareness of investors and we cannot guarantee that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. As a result, holders of our securities may have difficulty finding purchasers for our shares should they attempt to sell shares held by them. Even if a more active market should develop, the price of our shares of common stock may be highly volatile. Our shares should be purchased only by investors having no need for liquidity in their investment and who can hold our shares for an indefinite period of time.\nWe cannot guarantee that our common stock will remain listed on Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are not able to comply with the Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and our common stock would likely be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the OTC Pink Sheets. As a consequence of any such delisting, a stockholder would likely find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the prices of our common stock. Also, a delisting of our common stock would adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and harm our business.\nIf and when a larger trading market for our common stock develops, the market price of our common stock is still likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations, and you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price at which you acquired them.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf Variations in our revenues and operating expenses;\n\u25cf Actual or anticipated changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally;\n\u25cf Market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole;\n\u25cf Actual or expected changes in our growth rates or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u25cf Developments in the financial markets and worldwide or regional economies;\n\u25cf Announcements of innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf Announcements by the government relating to regulations that govern our industry;\n\u25cf Sales of our common stock or other securities by us or in the open market; and\n\u25cf Changes in the market valuations of other comparable companies.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price could decline.\nSecurities analysts from H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, Zacks Investment Research, and Edison Group currently cover our common stock, but may not do so in the future. Our lack of analyst coverage might depress the price of our common stock and result in limited trading volume. If we do receive analyst coverage in the future, any negative reports published by such analysts could have similar effects.\nThe application of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules to our common stock could limit trading activity in the market, and our stockholders may find it more difficult to sell their stock.\nOur common stock trades at less than $5.00 per share and is therefore subject to the SEC\u2019s so-called \u201cpenny stock rules\u201d. Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The broker-dealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit their market price and liquidity. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our securities.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our securities, which may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our securities and have an adverse effect on the market for our securities.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and as a result you must rely on increases in the market price of our common stock for returns on your equity investment.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board deems relevant.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) may delay or deter a change of control transaction.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of deterring takeovers, such as those provisions authorizing our Board to issue, from time to time, any series of preferred stock and fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of such series of preferred stock; prohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting; requiring advance notice of stockholder intention to put forth director nominees or bring up other business at a stockholders\u2019 meeting; prohibiting stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders; requiring a 66 2/3% majority stockholder approval in order for stockholders to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or adopt new bylaws; providing that, subject to the rights of preferred shares, the directors will be divided into three classes and the number of directors is to be fixed exclusively by our Board; and providing that none of our directors may be removed without cause. Section 203 of the DGCL, from which we did not elect to opt out, provides that if a holder acquires 15% or more of our stock without prior approval of our Board, that holder will be subject to certain restrictions on its ability to acquire us within three years. These provisions may delay or deter a change of control of us and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13556, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "TRNX"}
