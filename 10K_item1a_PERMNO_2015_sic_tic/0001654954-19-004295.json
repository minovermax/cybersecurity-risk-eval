{"cik": "1697851", "company": "Novume Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Corporate Structure and Business\nWe are currently not profitable and we may be unable to become profitable on a quarterly or annual basis.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had a loss from operations before taxes of $5,703,499. We cannot assure that we will be profitable in the future. Our ability to become profitable in future periods could be impacted by budgetary constraints, government and political agendas, economic instability and other items that are not in our control. We cannot assure that our financial performance will sustain a sufficient level to completely support operations. A significant portion of our expenses are fixed in advance. As such, we generally are unable to reduce our expenses significantly in the short-term to compensate for any unexpected delay or decrease in anticipated revenues or increases in planned investments. In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant expenses related to acquisitions and the development of new products and services. As a result, we may continue to experience operating losses and net losses in the future, which would make it difficult to fund operations and achieve our business plan and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have not been a leading provider of vehicle recognition devices in the past and do not have the level of established contacts and existing business relationships that some of our competitors have.\nAlthough it is growing, our presence in the public safety and vehicle recognition market has been limited and has only recently, with the acquisition of assets from OpenALPR, extended beyond the United States and Canada. As a result of this, although we believe our products and services have significant competitive advantages, we may encounter difficulties in establishing widespread market acceptance of our products in various markets and regions. Early successes in penetrating these markets and regions may not be able to be sustained once our ability to compete with our more established competitors comes to their attention. They may seek to develop more competitive products before their existing contracts expire, reduce prices, use to advantage their past association as a trusted provider and their superior financial and marketing resources and use other stratagems to competitive advantage, which could significantly impact our ability to grow as rapidly as we expect.\nIf we experience declining or flat revenues and fail to manage such declines effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plans and may experience future weaknesses in operating results.\nTo achieve future growth, we will need to continue to add additional qualified personnel, and invest in additional research and development and sales and marketing activities, which could lead to increases in our expenses and future declines in operating results. In addition, our future expansion is expected to place a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. If we are unable to manage these activities or any revenue declines successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers to our services on a cost-effective basis, our revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe must continue to attract a large number of customers on a cost-effective basis. We rely on a variety of marketing methods to attract new customers to our services. Our ability to attract new customers also depends on the competitiveness of the pricing of our services. If our current marketing initiatives are not successful or become unavailable, if the cost of such initiatives were to significantly increase, or if our competitors offer similar services at lower prices, we may not be able to attract new customers on a cost-effective basis and, as a result, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to retain our existing customers, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWith the addition of OpenALPR, some of the technical services offered by us are sold pursuant to agreements that are on a short-term subscription basis. Customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after their subscription period expires, and these subscriptions may not be renewed on the same or more profitable terms. As a result, our ability to stain our growth depends in part on subscription renewals. We may not be able to accurately predict future trends in customer renewals, and our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services, the prices of our services, the prices of services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services, renew on less favorable terms, or do not purchase additional functionality or subscriptions, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline, and our profitability and gross margins may be harmed.\nOur sales cycles for enterprise and government clients can be long, unpredictable and require considerable time and expense, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nThe timing of our revenue from sales to enterprise and government clients is difficult to predict. These efforts require us to educate our clients about the use and benefit of our services, including the technical capabilities and potential cost savings to an organization. Enterprise clients typically undertake a significant evaluation process that has in the past, resulted in lengthy sales cycles, typically several months. We spend substantial time, effort and money on our enterprise sales efforts without any assurance that these efforts will produce any sales. In addition, service subscriptions are frequently subject to budget constraints and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. If sales expected from a specific client for a particular reporting period are not realized in that period or at all, our results could fall short of expectations and our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf our efforts to build a strong brand identity are not successful, we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that building and maintaining a strong brand identity plays an important role in attracting and retaining customers for our products and users for our services, who may have other options from which to obtain services. We are currently involved in a major initiative to establish a new brand for our technology products and services in the public safety and vehicle recognition markets, which will require time and expense. In order to build a strong brand, we believe that we must offer innovative service offerings that our customers and subscribers value, and also market and promote those service offerings through effective marketing campaigns, promotions and communications with our customer base. From time to time, clients and subscribers may express dissatisfaction with our services or react negatively to our strategic business decisions, such as changes that we make in pricing, features or service offerings, including the discontinuance of a free service. To the extent that client dissatisfaction with our services or strategic business decisions is widespread or not adequately addressed, our brand identity may suffer and, as a result, our ability to attract and retain clients and subscribers may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may not be able to capitalize on potential emerging market opportunities and new services that we introduce may not generate the revenue and earnings we anticipated, which may adversely affect our business.\nOur business strategy involves identifying emerging market opportunities which we can capitalize on by successfully developing and introducing new services or enhancing existing services designed to address those market opportunities. We have made, and expect to continue to make, investments in research and development in an effort to capitalize on potential emerging market opportunities that we have identified in the public safety and vehicle recognition markets. Emerging markets and opportunities often take time to fully develop, and they attract a significant number of competitors. If the emerging markets we have targeted ultimately fail to materialize as we or others have anticipated or if potential clients choose to adopt solutions offered by our competitors rather than our own solutions, we may not be able to generate the revenue and earnings we anticipated, and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIndustry consolidation may result in increased competition.\nSome of our competitors have made or may make acquisitions or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive service than they individually had offered. In addition, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships or strategic relationships. We expect these trends to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions. Many of the companies driving this trend have significantly greater financial, technical and other resources than we do and may be better positioned to acquire and offer complementary services and technologies. The companies resulting from such combinations may create more compelling service offerings and may offer greater pricing flexibility than we can or may engage in business practices that make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs, technology or service functionality. These pressures could result in a substantial loss of customers or a reduction in our revenues.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in time to address the needs of our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nThe cloud-based services markets in which some of our newer services compete are characterized by rapid technological change, the frequent introduction of new services and evolving industry standards. Our ability to remain competitive will depend in large part on our ability to continue to enhance our existing services and develop new service offerings that keep pace with these markets\u2019 rapid technological developments. Additionally, to achieve market acceptance for our services, we must effectively anticipate and offer services that meet changing client demands in a timely manner. Clients may require features and capabilities that our current services do not have. If we fail to develop services that satisfy customer requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to renew services with existing clients and our ability to create or increase demand for our services will be harmed, and our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe success of our business will depend, in part, on the continued services of certain key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nThe success of our business will depend, in part, on the continued services of certain members of our management. In particular, the loss of the services of Robert A. Berman, as President and Chief Executive Officer and a director, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could significantly disrupt our business.\nWe face competition for qualified individuals from numerous professional services and technology companies. For example, our competitors may be able to attract and retain a more qualified professional and technical personnel by offering more competitive compensation packages. If we are unable to attract new personnel and retain our current personnel, we may not be able to develop and maintain our services at the same levels as our competitors and we may, therefore, lose potential customers and sales penetration in certain markets. It may also be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals in the timeframe demanded by our clients. Furthermore, some of our contracts may require us to employ only individuals who have particular government security clearance levels. Our failure to attract and retain key individuals could impair our ability to provide services to our clients and conduct our business effectively. Our failure to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan and, as a result, our ability to compete would decrease, our operating results would suffer and our revenues would decrease.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions which we consummate and we may be subject to business uncertainties.\nWe acquired the Firestorm Entities, Brekford, the Global Entities and BC Management in 2017, certain assets of Secure Education in January 2018, and substantially all of the assets of OpenALPR in March 2019. We are continuing to integrate the operations of these acquired companies that previously operated independently. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter significant difficulties in integrating the respective operations of these companies or that they will achieve the results of operations that we expected.\nThe difficulties of integrating the acquisitions may include, among others: unanticipated issues in integration of information, communications, and other systems; unanticipated incompatibility of logistics, marketing, and administration methods; aligning the business cultures of both companies; preserving important strategic client relationships; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; and coordinating geographically separate organizations.\nUncertainties about the effect of our recent acquisitions on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on our Company. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel for a period of time after the acquisitions, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us, which may have an adverse effect on our Company. Employee retention may be particularly challenging, as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company.\nThe achievement of the benefits expected from integration of acquired companies may require us to incur significant costs. The incurrence of any such costs, as well as any unexpected costs or delays, in connection with such integration, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe may be required to write-down certain assets after completing our required annual evaluations, which may affect our reported financial results.\nThe initial determination of the fair value of assets we acquire upon consummation of an acquisition is based upon an internal valuation. We are required to analyze the carrying value of our acquired intangibles and goodwill on an annual basis going forward. After the detailed annual evaluation of the carrying value of the intangible assets, as supported by external analysis, we may be required to make adjustments to our consolidated balance sheet and/or statement of operations. Any adjustments will affect our reported financial results.\nWe may be required to redeem our outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe holders of our outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (consisting of 502,327 shares as of March 31, 2019), will have the right to require the Company to redeem their shares, at any time from and after November 8, 2021, at a price of $15.00 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends (such accrued but unpaid Series A Preferred Stock dividends are equal to an aggregate of $263,721 as of March 31, 2019). In the event that the market price of our common stock does not exceed the conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock at the time of redemption, the holder of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are likely to require us to redeem the shares, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources and business prospects.\nOur significant debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition. If we default on our secured debt, the lender may foreclose on our assets.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we (through our Global Entities subsidiaries) had $1,094,766 outstanding under our line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cWFB\u201d), secured by one of our subsidiary\u2019s accounts receivable. WFB agreed to advance Global Entities, 90% of all eligible accounts with a maximum facility amount of $5,000,000. If we default on this debt, the lender may foreclose on its collateral, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. As of March 31, 2019, $283,170 was outstanding under this line of credit.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we (through our AOC Key Solutions subsidiary) had $566,447 outstanding under an account purchase agreement with WFB, pursuant to which AOC Key Solutions agreed to sell and assign to WFB certain collateral, including all of its accounts. WFB agreed to advance to our subsidiary, 90% of all eligible accounts with a maximum facility amount of $3,000,000. A default under this agreement would have a material, adverse effect on our business and operations. As of March 31, 2019, $397,178 was outstanding under this line of credit.\nOn April 3, 2018, Novume and Brekford entered into a transaction pursuant to which an institutional investor loaned $2,000,000 to Novume and Brekford (the \u201c2018 Promissory Note\u201d). In addition, Novume had $500,000 of subordinated Notes due to Avon Road Partners, L.P. and had $1,000,000 of additional subordinated notes outstanding in connection with its acquisition of Firestorm.\nAs a result, as of December 31, 2018, we had $3,589,706 of notes payable, exclusive of unamortized interest and financing costs, and $1,661,212 due on lines of credit.\nOn March 12, 2019, Novume entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which investors loaned $20,000,000 to Novume (the \u201cNote Purchase Agreement\u201d) of which $2,000,000 was used to retire in its entirety the 2018 Promissory Note and $500,000 was used to retire in its entirety the subordinated note with Avon Road Partners, L.P. The notes are due and payable on March 11, 2021 and bear interest at 16% per annum, of which at least 10% per annum shall be paid in cash. The full remaining portion of all interest, if any, accrues and is to be paid at maturity or earlier redemption. The notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of Novume. The Note Purchase Agreement has an effective interest rate of 24.87%.\nOur current debt obligations could: require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments of interest, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and meet other corporate requirements; make it more difficult for us to satisfy our other obligations; impede us from obtaining additional financing in the future; impose restrictions on us with respect to the use of our available cash; place us at a competitive disadvantage when compared to our competitors who have less debt; and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business prospects. In addition, unless we are able to retire or refinance the debt issued pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement on or prior to March 11, 2021, we could be held in default, which would substantially impair the value of our assets and our common stock.\nWe may issue additional notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial additional debt which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment in the Company.\nThe anticipated cash needs of our business could change significantly as we pursue business opportunities, if our business plans change, if economic conditions change from those currently prevailing or from those now anticipated, or if other unexpected circumstances arise that may have a material effect on the cash flow or profitability of our business. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business, either internally or through acquisition, we may need to seek to secure additional debt financing. We may not be able to obtain financing arrangements on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to meet our needs in the future.\nThe incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including: default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness and increased interest payments if we breach covenants that include the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; and limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nOur business has significant working capital needs and if we are unable to satisfy those needs from cash generated from our operations or borrowings, our financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe require significant amounts of working capital to operate our business. If we experience a significant and sustained drop in operating profits, or if there are unanticipated reductions in cash inflows or increases in cash outlays, we may be subject to cash shortfalls. If such a shortfall were to occur for even a brief period, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In particular, we use working capital to pay interest expenses and expenses relating to our employees and temporary workers and to satisfy our workers\u2019 compensation liabilities. Generally, we pay our workers on a biweekly basis while we generally receive payments from our customers 30 to 60 days after billing. As a result, we must maintain sufficient cash availability to pay employees and independent contractors and fund related payroll liabilities prior to receiving payment from customers.\nWe have derived working capital for our operations primarily through cash from operating activities from our subsidiaries, revolving lines of credit, issuance of debt, the sale of assets and the sale of our equity. We believe that our current sources of capital are adequate to meet our working capital needs. However, our available sources of capital are limited. If our working capital needs increase in the future, we may be forced to seek additional sources of capital, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nAny future failure to comply with the covenants which may occur under our promissory notes and revolving credit facilities could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could trigger increased interest payments or prepayment obligations which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTCJA\u201d), was enacted on December 22, 2017 and has affected U.S. tax law by changing U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The expected impact of the TCJA was reflected in our consolidated financial statements in the period it was enacted. In our 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements, we have completed our assessment of the final impact of the TCJA and determined that there were no material adjustments to the expected amounts previously recorded. However, the TCJA is complex and additional interpretative guidance may be issued that could affect the final assessment made that could impact our deferred tax assets.\nOur operating results may be harmed if we are required to collect sales or other related taxes for our subscription services or pay regulatory fees in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so.\nPrimarily due to the nature of our cloud-based services in certain states and countries, we do not believe we are required to collect sales or other related taxes from our customers in certain states or countries. However, one or more other states or countries may seek to impose sales, regulatory fees or other tax collection obligations on us, including for past sales by us or our resellers and other partners. A successful assertion that we should be collecting sales or other related taxes on our services or paying regulatory fees could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our services or otherwise harm our business and operating results.\nImproper disclosure of confidential and personal data could result in liability and harm to our reputation.\nOur handling and storage of the data we collect from some of our employees, customers and vendors, and our processing of data, which may include confidential or personally identifiable information, through the services we provide, may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations, which have been adopted by various federal, state and foreign governments to regulate the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals. Several foreign countries in which we conduct business, including the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) and Canada, currently have in place, or have recently proposed, laws or regulations concerning privacy, data protection and information security, which are more restrictive than those imposed in the United States. Some of these laws are in their early stages and we cannot yet determine the impact these revised laws and regulations, if implemented, may have on our business. However, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these privacy laws, regulations, policies or obligations or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data in our possession, could result in government enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties and/or adverse publicity, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nFor example, the EEA-wide General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) became applicable on May 25, 2018, replacing the data protection laws of each EEA member state. The GDPR implemented more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements to erase an individual\u2019s information upon request, mandatory data breach notification requirements and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. It also significantly increases penalties for non-compliance, including where we act as a service provider (e.g. data processor). If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with applicable current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data or our marketing practices, fines, for example, of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) under the GDPR, or other liabilities, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business.\nData protection regulation remains an area of increased focus in all jurisdictions and data protection regulations continue to evolve. There is no assurance that we will be able to meet new requirements that may be imposed on the transfer of personally identifiable information from the EU to the United States without incurring substantial expense or at all. European and/or multi-national customers may be reluctant to purchase or continue to use our services due to concerns regarding their data protection obligations. In addition, we may be subject to claims, legal proceedings or other actions by individuals or governmental authorities if they have reason to believe that our data privacy or security measures fail to comply with current or future laws and regulations.\nMoreover, we must ensure that certain vendors and customers who have access to such information also have the appropriate privacy policies, procedures and protections in place. Although we take customary measures to protect such information, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee or subcontractor error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to customer data, our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are growing increasingly sophisticated. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nThis environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls throughout the Company. Despite these efforts, it is possible that our security controls over data, training, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable or other confidential information.\nIf an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, we could be liable under laws and regulations that protect personal or other confidential data resulting in increases costs or loss of revenues and the market perception of our services could be harmed.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber and other security threats or disruptions.\nWe face various cyber and other security threats, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and networks; insider threats; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure; and threats from terrorist acts or other acts of aggression. Cyber threats are constant and evolving and include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, malicious software, destructive malware, attacks by computer hackers attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, disruption or denial of service attacks, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release or loss of confidential, personal or otherwise protected information (ours or that of our employees, customers or subcontractors), and corruption of data, networks or systems. In addition, we could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in our partners\u2019 or customers\u2019 systems that are used in connection with our business. Our clients and subcontractors face similar threats and/or they may not be able to detect or deter them, or effectively to mitigate resulting losses. These threats could damage our reputation as well as our subcontractor\u2019s ability to perform and could affect our client\u2019s ability to pay.\nAlthough we use various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats to us, our clients and our partners, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient. The impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could result in the loss of information or capabilities, harm to individuals or property, damage to our reputation and/or require remedial actions or lead to loss of business, regulatory actions potential liability and financial loss, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe are dependent upon technology services, and if we experience damage, service interruptions or failures in our computer and telecommunications systems, our customer and worker relationships and our ability to attract new customers may be adversely affected.\nOur business could be interrupted by damage to or disruption of our computer, telecommunications equipment, software systems, or software applications. Our customers\u2019 businesses may be adversely affected by any system, application or equipment failure we experience. As a result of any of the foregoing, our relationships with our customers may be impaired, we may lose customers, our ability to attract new customers may be adversely affected and we could be exposed to contractual liability. Precautions in place to protect us from, or minimize the effect of, such events may not be adequate.\nIn addition, the failure or disruption of mail, communications and/or utilities could cause an interruption or suspension of our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, revenue, profits and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards, we will not be able to remain competitive, and the demand for our services will likely decline.\nThe markets in which we operate are in general characterized by the following factors: changes due to rapid technological advances; additional qualification requirements related to technological challenges; and evolving industry standards and changes in the regulatory and legislative environment. Our future success will depend upon our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards, and to effectively develop, introduce, market and gain broad acceptance of new product and service enhancements incorporating the latest technological advancements.\nWe operate in highly-competitive industries, some with low barriers to entry, and may be unable to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.\nOur business is competitive, and we compete with companies in highly competitive industries that may have greater name recognition and financial resources, as well as many independent sole-proprietors who sell themselves as outsourced resources. We also compete with providers of outsourcing services, systems integrators, computer systems consultants and other providers of services. We expect that the level of competition will remain high, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.\nThe needs of our clients change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to develop services and solutions that address these changing needs of our clients, and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and solutions. In order to compete effectively in our markets, we must target our potential customers carefully, continue to improve our efficiencies and the scope and quality of our services, and rely on our service quality, innovation, and client relations to provide services on a cost-effective basis to our clients. Our competitors may be able to provide clients with different or greater capabilities or technologies or better contract terms than we can provide, including technical qualifications, past contract experience, geographic presence, price and the availability of qualified professional personnel.\nBased on recent technological developments, the market for outsourced services may diminish. Some of our competitors are beginning to advertise for various services on line, including experts for sale, anonymous authors to complete certain proposal sections for an \u201cintroductory fee,\u201d and even selling entire proposals on-line, sometimes by overseas vendors at extremely low prices. If these companies are successful at providing traditional consulting services at prices we cannot compete with, it may diminish the demand for some of our services, which may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, heightened competition among our existing competitors, especially on a price basis, or by new entrants into the market, could create additional competitive pressures that may reduce our margins and adversely affect our business. If our competitive advantages are not compelling or sustainable, then we are unlikely to increase or sustain profits and our stock price could decline.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with geographic market concentration.\nThe geographic concentration of revenue greater than 10% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was generated in the following areas:\nConsequently, economic conditions in these regions could reduce demand for our products and services, increase costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of future operations.\nA downturn of the U.S. or global economy could result in our customers using fewer products and services or becoming unable to pay us for our services on a timely basis or at all, which would materially adversely affect our business.\nBecause demand for our solutions and services are sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity, our business may suffer during economic downturns. During periods of weak economic growth or economic contraction, the demand for outsourced services could decline. When demand drops, our operating profit could be impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base because expenses may not decline as quickly as revenues. In periods of decline, we can only reduce selling and administrative expenses to a certain level without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our business.\nAdditionally, during economic downturns companies may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors, or they may become unable to pay their obligations. If our customers become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our cash flow and profitability may suffer significantly.\nWe may be exposed to employment-related claims and losses, including class action lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe typically place or assign personnel in the workplaces of other businesses. The risks of these activities include possible claims relating to: wrongful termination or denial of employment; damage to customer facilities due to negligence; violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues; fraudulent or criminal activity; misappropriation of funds; misuse of customer proprietary information; inadvertent assignment of illegal aliens; and discrimination and harassment.\nWe may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these claims. In addition, these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming and expensive. New employment and labor laws and regulations may be proposed or adopted that may increase the potential exposure of employers to employment-related claims and litigation. There can be no assurance that the corporate policies we have in place to help reduce our exposure to these risks will be effective or that we will not experience losses as a result of these risks. There can also be no assurance that the insurance policies we have purchased to insure against certain risks will be adequate or that insurance coverage will remain available on commercially reasonable terms or be sufficient in amount or scope of coverage.\nWe are dependent on workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage at commercially reasonable terms.\nWe provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance for our employees and temporary workers and are contractually obligated to collateralize our workers\u2019 compensation obligations under our workers\u2019 compensation program through irrevocable letters of credit, surety bonds or cash. A significant portion of our workers\u2019 compensation program renews annually on January 1 of each year, and as part of the renewal, could be subject to an increase in collateral. In addition, collateral requirements can be significant and place pressure on our liquidity and working capital capacity. Further, we cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future or that adequate replacement policies will be available on commercially reasonable terms. Depending on future changes in collateral requirements, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital in the future, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of our workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage would prevent us from doing business in the majority of our markets\nAny future Congressional spending cuts, delays in the completion of the appropriation process or condition that affects the U.S. Government could adversely impact our operating results.\nFollowing the U.S. government shutdown that began in December 2018 and ended in January 2019, there still remains uncertainty regarding how, or if, sequestration cuts will be applied in the U.S. government\u2019s 2020 fiscal year and beyond. Despite the temporary easing of sequestration cuts from prior legislation, the calls for cuts could resurface. That, plus other deficit reduction pressures which may arise in the future, may result in congressional constraint on discretionary spending by the U.S. government will remain a question for a number of years.\nIf annual appropriations bills are not enacted on a timely basis for future fiscal years, the U.S. government may once again operate under continuing resolution(s), thus abating request for proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) processes and restricting new contracts or program starts and resulting in government slowdowns, or even shutdowns. The uncertainty regarding the volume of RFPs issued by the U.S. government could have long-term impacts for our industry and our Company. Because we generate significant revenues from clients that bid on contracts with U.S. government agencies, our operating results could be adversely affected by government slowdowns or shutdowns, spending caps or changes in national budgetary priorities. In addition, delays in RFP releases, slow program starts or uncertainty in the award of contracts or task orders could adversely impact our operating results.\nAny condition or occurrence that affects society or the U.S. government can also impact government contractors. Because our Company maintains a significant presence among government contractors, we could be adversely affected by a national or international event that undermines confidence in the government or financial markets. Any impact on federal spending could have a negative effect on our revenue and adversely affect our future results.\nIf our contractors and subcontractors fail to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties, or if we are unable to maintain these relationships, our revenue, profitability, and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on contractors and subcontractors in conducting our business. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our contractors or subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the contractor or subcontractor, client concerns about the contractor or subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract or subcontract. In addition, if any of our subcontractors fail to perform the agreed-upon services, go out of business, or fail to perform on a project, then our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized and we may be contractually responsible for the work performed by those contractors or subcontractors. Historically, our relationship with our contractors and subcontractors have been good, and we have not experienced any material failure of performance by our contractors and subcontractors. However, there can be no assurance that such experience will continue and the absence of qualified subcontractors with which we have a satisfactory relationship could adversely affect the quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts.\nWe also rely on relationships with other contractors when we act as their subcontractor or joint venture partner. Our future revenue and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their subcontracts or teaming arrangement relationships with us or if a government agency terminates or reduces these other contractors\u2019 programs, does not award them new contracts, or refuses to pay under a contract.\nOur business is directly tied to the success of our government contracting clients, which are increasingly reliant on ID/IQ contracts. ID/IQ contracts are not firm orders for services, and we may generate limited or no revenue from these contracts which could adversely affect our operating performance.\nID/IQ contracts are typically awarded to multiple contractors, and the award of an ID/IQ contract does not represent a firm order for services. Generally, under an ID/IQ contract, the government is not obligated to order a minimum of services or supplies from its contractor, irrespective of the total estimated contract value. In effect, an ID/IQ award acts as a \u201clicense,\u201d permitting a government contractor to bid on task orders issued under the ID/IQ contract, but not guaranteeing the award of individual task orders. Following an award under a multi-award ID/IQ program, the customer develops requirements for task orders that are competitively bid against all of the contract awardees. However, many contracts also permit the U.S. government to direct work to a specific contractor. Our clients may not win new task orders under these contracts for various reasons, including price, past performance and responsiveness, among others. We support our government contractor clients both when they compete to get the umbrella ID/IQ contract and subsequently when we help the winners of those contracts compete for individual tasks. The proposals for both stages can be relatively brief and require quick turn-arounds, thus potentially reducing some opportunities to be awarded significant turn-key engagements. While it is possible that the increased importance of winning the umbrella ID/IQ contract will prompt clients to hire outside firms to prepare their proposals, it is also likely that government contractors will decide to prepare ID/IQ proposals without the assistance from outside experts.\nWe incur substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to related compliance matters.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. under rules implemented by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), and The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). These impose various requirements on public companies, including establishing and maintaining effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management team will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance requirements and we may need to hire additional personnel. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. To achieve compliance with Section 404, we engage in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants, and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and divert management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nAs a public company, complying with applicable rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantially higher costs to obtain and maintain the same or similar coverage.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities.\nIn connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our management concluded that the Company had material weaknesses in its internal controls because we did not have adequately designed internal controls to ensure the timely preparation and review of the accounting for certain complex, non-routine transactions by those with appropriate technical expertise, which was necessary to provide reasonable assurance that the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures would be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. In addition, we did not have adequately designed and documented financial close and management review controls to properly detect and prevent certain accounting errors and omitted disclosures in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. As defined in the Standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management is executing a plan to remediate the material weaknesses, although there can be no assurance that such our plan will be successful.\nManagement continues to review and assess our internal controls to ensure we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls. However, any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, and cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required with respect to annual reports that we will file. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations, which could subject our business to higher tax liability.\nWe may be limited in the portion of net operating loss carry forwards that we can offset future taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2018, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $9.7 million and $0.5 million, net of federal tax effect, respectively. A lack of future taxable income could adversely affect our ability to use these NOLs. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, including through acquisitions, could result in ownership changes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and may result in a limitation on the amount of NOL carry forwards that could be used annually to offset future taxable income and taxes payable. Our NOLs at December 31, 2018 may also be impaired under similar provisions of state law, and may expire unused or underused, which would prevent us from using our NOL carry forwards to offset future taxable income.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe have experienced fluctuations in earnings and cash flows from operations from year to year. If our business declines, we may need to raise additional capital to pursue acquisitions or expand our operations. Such additional capital may be raised through bank borrowings, or other debt or equity financings. We cannot assure you that any additional capital will be available on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, and such additional financing may result in further dilution to our stockholders.\nOur capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: our ability to increase revenue, reduce net losses or generate net income; market acceptance of our services, and the overall level of sales of our services; our need to respond to technological advancements and our competitors\u2019 introductions of new products, services or technologies; our ability to control costs; promptness of customer payments; our ability to successfully negotiate arrangements with credit providers; and enhancements to subsidiaries\u2019 infrastructure and systems; government procurement.\nIf our capital requirements are materially different from those currently planned, we may need additional capital sooner than anticipated. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. Additional equity or debt financing may not be available on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to continue our operations as planned, develop or enhance our products, expand our sales and marketing programs, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, or we may be forced to sell assets at prices below their stated value.\nAssertions by a third party that our services and solutions infringe its intellectual property, whether or not correct, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses.\nThere is frequent litigation in the software and technology industries based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We may in the future be, subject to third-party patent infringement or other intellectual property-related lawsuits as we face increasing competition and become increasingly visible. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Because of the potential for court awards that are difficult to predict, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts. In addition, our service agreements may require us to indemnify our customers from certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling related to any such claims. These types of claims could harm our relationship with our customers, deter future customers from subscribing to our services or expose us to further litigation. These costs, monetary or otherwise, associated with defending against third party allegations of infringement could have negative effects on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf our services are used to commit intentional or illegal acts, we may incur significant liabilities, our services may be perceived as not secure, and customers may curtail or stop using our services.\nCertain services offered by us enable customers to capture data from video images. We do not control the use or content of information accessed by our customers through our services. If our services are used to commit bad or illegal acts, we may become subject to claims and subject to other potential liabilities. As a result, defending such claims could be expensive and time-consuming, and we could incur significant liability to individuals or businesses who were the targets of such acts. As a result, our business may suffer and our reputation may be damaged.\nWe use a limited number of data centers to deliver our services. Any disruption of service at these facilities could harm our business.\nOur cloud-based services are hosted from third-party data center facilities located in various parts of the U.S. We do not control the operation of these facilities. The owners of our data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. Any changes in third-party service levels at our data centers or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our services could harm our reputation and may damage our clients\u2019 businesses. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits to clients, subject us to potential liability, cause clients to terminate their subscriptions or harm our renewal rates.\nOur data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, pandemics, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, vandalism or other misconduct, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.\nOur long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our services to customers located outside of the United States, and thus our business is susceptible to risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe currently maintain offices and have sales personnel inside of the United States, however, we plan on expanding our international operations. Our international expansion efforts may not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to other risks than those we have generally faced in the United States. These risks include: localization of our services and adaptation for local practices, legal standards and regulatory requirements; difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; dependence on customers, third parties, and channel partners with whom we do not have extensive experience; potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value-added or other tax systems; reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities. Operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, service mark, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, all of which provide only limited protection. In addition, we have patented certain technologies used to provide our services. We cannot assure you any future patents issued will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future from future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Also, we cannot assure you that any future service mark or trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any registered service marks or trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.\nWe endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and agreements with parties with whom we do business to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. The steps we have taken, however, may not prevent unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our successful legal actions against these infringers, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.\nFurthermore, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are available. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could negatively affect our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation.\nA portion of the technologies we license incorporate so-called \u201copen source\u201d software, some of which we have created, and we may incorporate additional open source software in the future. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third-parties under open source licenses. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer our services that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and/or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. If an author or other third-party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our services that contained the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our services.\nMaterial defects or errors in the software that we use to deliver our services could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our services.\nThe software applications underlying our services are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Any defects that cause interruptions to the availability of our services could result in: a reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of our services; sales credits or refunds to customers; loss of existing customers and difficulty in attracting new customers; reputational harm; and diversion of internal resources. The costs incurred in correcting any material defects or errors in our services may be substantial and could harm our operating results.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, telecommunications and other communications technologies could harm our business and operating results.\nAs Internet commerce and telecommunications continue to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign governments and agencies becomes more likely. Any increase in regulation could affect our clients\u2019 ability to collect and share data, potentially reducing demand for our products and services. In addition, taxation of products and services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet or utilizing telecommunications services may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting the exchange of information over the Internet could diminish the viability of our services, which could harm our business and operating results.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nThere has been a limited public market for our common stock, the stock price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the public offering price.\nOur common stock was previously quoted on the OTCQX and has been trading on the Nasdaq since January 10, 2018. There is no established trading market for some of our securities and there has been a limited public market for our common stock. The market prices of the securities of newly listed companies can be highly volatile. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: variations in our results of operations, cash flows, and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; variations in general market, financial markets, economic, and political conditions in the United States; failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders; rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; new laws, regulations, or executive orders, or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or unfavorable determinations or settlements in any such suits; and developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or our technology, or third-party proprietary rights.\nIn addition, the stock markets have shown the capacity to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can have short- and long-term effects on the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and harm our business.\nOur common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nWe may be unable to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq. On December 13, 2018, we received a letter from the Nasdaq indicating that the Company is required to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share of its common stock. The Company's closing bid price of its common stock had been less than $1 for the previous 30 consecutive business days. As such, the Company was not compliant with the minimum bid price requirements under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The letter from Nasdaq provided the Company with a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until June 11, 2019, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If at any time during this 180-day compliance period the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock is at least $1 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, then Nasdaq will provide the Company with written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed.\nIn the event that our common stock were to be delisted from the Nasdaq, we expect that it would be traded on the OTCQB or OTCQX, which are unorganized, inter-dealer, over-the-counter markets which provide significantly less liquidity than the Nasdaq or other national securities exchanges. In the event that our common stock were to be delisted from the Nasdaq, it may have a material adverse effect on the trading and price of our common stock.\nIf, for any reason, Nasdaq should delist our common stock from trading on its exchange and we are unable to obtain listing on another national securities exchange or take action to restore our compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements, a material adverse effect on our shareholders may occur due to a reduction in some or all of the following: the market price of our common shares; the liquidity of our common shares; our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations; the number of market makers in our common shares; and the number of institutional and general investors that will consider investing in our common shares.\nIn the event that our common stock were to be delisted from the Nasdaq, it may be considered a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d Securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our common stock would then be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations set forth in Rules 15g-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease covering us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nAs of March 31, 2019, we have outstanding a total of 19,367,619 shares of common stock and 3,973,163 warrants. Based on shares outstanding as of March 31, 2019, 9,470,959 shares of common stock, or 48.9%, are held by our officers, directors and their affiliated entities, and will be subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act and various vesting agreements. In addition, 4,859,947 shares of our common stock that are subject to outstanding options and warrants as of March 31, 2019, as well as 974,487 shares issuable upon the conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock, and 481,722 shares issuable upon the conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock, will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements, and Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of our shares in the public market or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. However, future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued on exercise of outstanding options, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe also expect that significant additional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nInvestors may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors, and investors purchasing our shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to quarterly dividends as set forth in more detail in the section entitled \u201cDescription of Capital Stock.\u201d We currently anticipate that for the foreseeable future we will retain all of our future earnings for the development, operation and growth of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any future determination to pay dividends on our common stock in will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nOur executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their affiliates will continue to exercise significant influence over our company, which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nAs of March 31, 2019, our executive officers, directors, five percent or greater stockholders and their respective affiliates owned in the aggregate approximately 48.9% of our common stock.\nThese stockholders have the ability to influence us through this ownership position and may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d have a public float of less than $75 million and have annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are subject to lesser disclosure obligations in our SEC filings compared to other issuers. Specifically, \"smaller reporting companies\" are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings, are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited consolidated financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d may make it harder for investors to analyze our operating results and financial prospects.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including that: the request of one or more stockholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than 35% of the vote at a meeting is required to call a stockholder meeting. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take certain actions you desire.", "PERMNO": 17270, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "REKR"}
