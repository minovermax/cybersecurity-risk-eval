RISK FACTORS\nIndustry, Operational and Macroeconomic Risks\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely impacted our business, and the continuance of this pandemic, or any future outbreak of any contagious diseases or other public health emergency, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a deterioration in the U.S. economy and our industry and resulted in a period of substantial economic and financial turmoil. The ultimate impact of this event on our business and the duration and future severity of the economic downturn caused by the pandemic are uncertain; however, the pandemic has adversely affected, and it is likely that the pandemic will continue to adversely affect, our business, team members, current and potential consumers, automobile dealers, and vendors, as well as our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nIn an attempt to contain COVID-19, certain state governments implemented social distancing guidelines, travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of non-essential businesses. These actions caused economic hardship in the areas in which they were implemented. While the prevalence, severity and impact of such restrictions have lessened, uncertainty remains as to when economic conditions will return to normalcy. Many automobile dealers were required to temporarily close or restrict their operations. Additionally, there have been supply chain disruptions in the automotive industry, which have resulted in low dealer inventories and elevated used vehicle prices. As a result, we have experienced a significant decline in Consumer Loan assignments.\nWe have worked with our consumers to provide relief where possible, including the temporary suspension of involuntary vehicle repossessions, late fees and suit starts. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused us to modify our business practices in an effort to increase team member safety, including allowing team members to work remotely, reconfiguring workstations to increase physical distance between team members, where permitted, limiting travel, and canceling physical participation in meetings and events, and we may take further actions as required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our team members. Our business operations may be disrupted further if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThere is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform certain functions could be negatively impacted. While the duration and potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy, and the automotive industry and our industry in particular, are difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in disruption of financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our consumers\u2019 ability to repay past or future Consumer Loans, and could negatively affect our liquidity and results of operations. In addition, a recession or further financial market correction resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect demand for used vehicles. A continued disruption in our workforce, decrease in collections from our consumers or decline in Consumer Loan assignments could cause a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and we continue to monitor the situation closely. The ultimate impact of this pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the disease or mitigate its impact, related restrictions on travel, additional federal stimulus measures and enhanced unemployment benefits, if any, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on consumer behavior, including any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of economic and supply chain disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, financial position, liquidity, and results of operations, though the full extent and duration is uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic may also intensify the risks described in the other risk factors disclosed in this Form 10-K. The COVID-19 pandemic, or any future outbreak of any contagious diseases or other public health emergency, could continue to, and may materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur inability to accurately forecast and estimate the amount and timing of future collections could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.\nSubstantially all of the Consumer Loans assigned to us are made to individuals with impaired or limited credit histories. Consumer Loans made to these individuals generally entail a higher risk of delinquency, default and repossession and higher losses than loans made to consumers with better credit. Since most of our revenue and cash flows from operations are generated from these Consumer Loans, our ability to accurately forecast Consumer Loan performance is critical to our business and financial results. At the time of assignment, we forecast future expected cash flows from the Consumer Loan. Based on these forecasts, which include estimates for wholesale vehicle prices in the event of vehicle repossession and sale, we make an advance or one-time purchase payment to the related Dealer at a level designed to maximize economic profit, a non-GAAP financial measure. We continue to forecast the expected collection rate of each Consumer Loan subsequent to assignment. These forecasts also serve as a critical assumption in our accounting for recognizing finance charge income and determining our allowance for credit losses. Please see the Critical Accounting Estimates - Finance Charge Revenue & Allowance for Credit Losses section in Item 7 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. Actual cash flows from any individual Consumer Loan are often different from cash flows estimated at the time of assignment. There can be no assurance that our forecasts will be accurate or that Consumer Loan performance will be as expected. In periods with changing economic conditions, accurately forecasting the performance of Consumer Loans is more difficult. In the event that our forecasts are not accurate, our financial position, liquidity and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nDue to competition from traditional financing sources and non-traditional lenders, we may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe automobile finance market for consumers who do not qualify for conventional automobile financing is large and highly competitive. The market is served by a variety of companies including \u201cbuy here, pay here\u201d dealerships. The market is also currently served by banks, captive finance affiliates of automobile manufacturers, credit unions and independent finance companies both publicly and privately owned. Many of these companies are much larger and have greater financial resources than are available to us, and many have long standing relationships with automobile dealerships. Providers of automobile financing have traditionally competed based on the interest rate charged, the quality of credit accepted, the flexibility of loan terms offered and the quality of service provided to dealers and consumers. We may be unable to compete successfully in the automobile finance market or, due to the intense competition in this market, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected as we adjust our business in response to competitive pressures. Increasing advance rates on Loans has the impact of reducing the return on capital we expect to earn on Loans. Additionally, if we are unsuccessful in maintaining and expanding our relationships with Dealers, we may be unable to accept Consumer Loans in the volume and on the terms that we anticipate.\nReliance on third parties to administer our ancillary product offerings could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe have relationships with TPPs to administer vehicle service contracts and GAP underwritten by third party insurers and financed by us. We depend on these TPPs to evaluate and pay claims in an accurate and timely manner. We also have a relationship with a TPP to administer GPS-SID. If our relationships with these TPPs were modified, disrupted, or terminated, we would need to obtain these services from an alternative administrator or provide them using our internal resources. We may be unable to replace these TPPs with a suitable alternative in a timely and efficient manner on terms we consider acceptable, or at all. In the event we were unable to effectively administer our ancillary products offerings, we may need to eliminate or suspend our ancillary product offerings from our future business, we may experience a decline in the performance of our Consumer Loans, our reputation in the marketplace could be undermined, and our financial position, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on our senior management and the loss of any of these individuals or an inability to hire additional team members could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nOur senior management average over 16 years of experience with us. Our success is dependent upon the management and the leadership skills of this team. In addition, competition from other companies to hire our team members possessing the necessary skills and experience required could contribute to an increase in team member turnover. The loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract and retain additional qualified team members could adversely affect us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing senior management or attract additional qualified team members.\nOur reputation is a key asset to our business, and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\nOur reputation is a key asset to our business. Our ability to attract consumers through our Dealers is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices and financial condition. Negative publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential consumers and Dealers, which could make it difficult for us to attract new consumers and Dealers and maintain existing Dealers. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.\nThe concentration of our Dealers in several states could adversely affect us.\nDealers are located throughout the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our five largest states (measured by advances paid to Dealers on Consumer Loans assigned under our Portfolio Program and one-time payments made to Dealers to purchase Consumer Loans assigned under our Purchase Program) contained 30.5% of our Dealers. While we believe we have a diverse geographic presence, for the near term, we expect that significant amounts of Consumer Loan assignments will continue to be generated by Dealers in these five states due to the number of Dealers in these states and currently prevailing economic, demographic, regulatory, competitive and other conditions in these states. Changes to conditions in these states could lead to an increase in Dealer attrition or a reduction in demand for our service that could materially adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nReliance on our outsourced business functions could adversely affect our business.\nWe outsource certain business functions to third party service providers, which increases our operational complexity and decreases our control. We rely on these service providers to provide a high level of service and support, which subjects us to risks associated with inadequate or untimely service. In addition, if these outsourcing arrangements were not renewed or were terminated or the services provided to us were otherwise disrupted, we would have to obtain these services from an alternative provider or provide them using our internal resources. We may be unable to replace, or be delayed in replacing these sources and there is a risk that we would be unable to enter into a similar agreement with an alternate provider on terms that we consider favorable or in a timely manner. In the future, we may outsource additional business functions. If any of these or other risks related to outsourcing were realized, our financial position, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to hire and retain foreign information technology personnel could be hindered by immigration restrictions.\nA significant portion of our information technology team is composed of foreign nationals whose ability to work for us depends on obtaining the necessary H-1B visas. The H-1B visa category allows U.S. employers to hire qualified foreign nationals to perform services in specialty occupations that require the attainment of at least a bachelor\u2019s degree or its equivalent. Our ability to hire and retain these foreign nationals and their ability to remain and work in the United States are affected by various laws and regulations, including limitations on the number of available H-1B visas, which the U.S. government allocates by lottery. Changes in the laws or regulations affecting the availability, allocation and/or cost of H-1B visas, eligibility for the H-1B visa category, or otherwise affecting the admission or retention of skilled foreign nationals by U.S. employers, or any increase in demand for H-1B visas relative to the limited supply of those visas, may adversely affect our ability to hire or retain foreign information technology personnel and may, as a result, increase our operating costs and impair our business operations.\nWe may be unable to execute our business strategy due to current economic conditions.\nOur financial position, liquidity and results of operations depend on management\u2019s ability to execute our business strategy. Key factors involved in the execution of our business strategy include achieving our desired Consumer Loan assignment volume, continued and successful use of CAPS and pricing strategy, the use of effective credit risk management techniques and servicing strategies, continued investment in technology to support operating efficiency and continued access to funding and liquidity sources. Although our pricing strategy is intended to maximize the amount of economic profit we generate, within the confines of capital and infrastructure constraints, there can be no assurance that this strategy will have its intended effect. Please see the Consumer Loan Volume section in Item 7 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. Our failure or inability to execute any element of our business strategy could materially adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions, the automobile or finance industries, or the non-prime consumer market could adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations, the ability of key vendors that we depend on to supply us with services, and our ability to enter into future financing transactions.\nWe are subject to general economic conditions which are beyond our control. During periods of economic slowdown or recession, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses may increase on our Consumer Loans and Consumer Loan prepayments may decline. These periods are also typically accompanied by decreased consumer demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding Consumer Loans, which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of loss in the event of default. Significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic recession may also depress the prices at which repossessed automobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales. Additionally, higher gasoline prices, increased focus on climate-related initiatives and regulation, declining stock market values, unstable real estate values, resets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, increasing unemployment levels, general availability of consumer credit or other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could increase loss frequency and decrease consumer demand for automobiles as well as weaken collateral values of automobiles. Because our business is focused on consumers who do not qualify for conventional automobile financing, the actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses on our Consumer Loans could be higher than those experienced in the general automobile finance industry, and could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn.\nWe rely on Dealers to originate Consumer Loans for assignment under our programs. High levels of Dealer attrition, due to a general economic downturn or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our operations. In addition, we rely on vendors to provide us with services we need to operate our business. Any disruption in our operations due to the untimely or discontinued supply of these services could substantially adversely affect our operations. Finally, during an economic slowdown or recession, our servicing costs may increase without a corresponding increase in finance charge revenue. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, defaults, repossessions or losses or increased servicing costs could also materially adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations and our ability to enter into future financing transactions.\nTechnological advancements or changes to trends in the automobile industry such as new autonomous driving technologies or car- and ride-sharing programs could decrease consumer demand for automobiles. Decreased consumer demand for automobiles could negatively impact demand for our financing programs as well as weaken collateral values of automobiles, which could materially adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, climate change, acts of war, terrorist attacks and threats or the escalation of military activity in response to these attacks or otherwise may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, climate change, acts of war, terrorist attacks and the escalation of military activity in response to these attacks or otherwise may have negative and significant effects, such as imposition of increased security measures, changes in applicable laws, market disruptions and job losses. These events may have an adverse effect on the economy in general. Moreover, the potential for future terrorist attacks and the national and international responses to these threats could affect the business in ways that cannot be predicted. The effect of any of these events or threats could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernmental or market responses to climate change and related environmental issues could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernments have become increasingly focused on the effects of climate change and related environmental issues. How governments act to mitigate climate and related environmental risks, as well as associated changes in the behavior and preferences of businesses and consumers, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We could, for example, experience decreased consumer demand for gasoline-powered automobiles and declining values of gasoline-powered automobiles securing outstanding Consumer Loans, which would weaken collateral coverage and increase the amount of loss in the event of default. Further, we may be compelled to change our business practices or our operational processes, and we could have less access to capital or face a higher cost of capital, because of climate- or environmental-driven changes in applicable law or due to related political, social or market pressure. It is possible as well that changes in climate and related environmental risks, perceptions of them, and governmental responses to them may occur more rapidly than our ability to adapt without disrupting our business which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nA small number of our shareholders have the ability to significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval and such shareholders have interests which may conflict with the interests of our other security holders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, based on filings made with the SEC and other information made available to us, Prescott General Partners, LLC and its affiliates beneficially owned 18.3% of our common stock, Jill Foss Watson beneficially owned 15.4% of our common stock and Allan V. Apple beneficially owned 12.6% of our common stock. As a result, these shareholders are able to significantly influence matters presented to shareholders, including the election and removal of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as any reclassification, reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and the control of our management and affairs, including executive compensation arrangements. Their interests may conflict with the interests of our other security holders.\n.\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\n.\nWe may be unable to continue to access or renew funding sources and obtain capital needed to maintain and grow our business.\nWe use debt financing to maintain and grow our business. We currently utilize the following primary forms of debt financing: (1) a revolving secured line of credit; (2) revolving secured warehouse (\u201cWarehouse\u201d) facilities; (3) asset-backed secured financings (\u201cTerm ABS\u201d); and (4) senior notes. We cannot guarantee that the revolving secured line of credit or the Warehouse facilities will continue to be available beyond their current maturity dates, on acceptable terms, or at all, or that we will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, our financial position, our results of operations, and the capacity for additional borrowing under our existing financing arrangements. If our various financing alternatives were to become limited or unavailable, we may be unable to maintain or grow Consumer Loan volume at the level that we anticipate and our operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe terms of our debt limit how we conduct our business.\nThe agreements that govern our debt contain covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur and guarantee debt;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase our stock;\n\u2022make investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022create liens on our assets;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022merge with or into other companies; and\n\u2022enter into transactions with stockholders and other affiliates.\nSome of our debt agreements also impose requirements that we maintain specified financial measures not in excess of, or not below, specified levels. In particular, our revolving credit facility requires, among other things, that we maintain (i) as of the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated funded debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to consolidated tangible net worth at or below a specified maximum; (ii) as of the end of each fiscal quarter calculated for the two fiscal quarters then ending, consolidated net income, as defined in the agreements, of not less than a specified minimum; and (iii) as of the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated income available for fixed charges for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to consolidated fixed charges, as defined in the agreements, for that period of not less than a specified minimum. These covenants limit the manner in which we can conduct our business and could prevent us from engaging in favorable business activities or financing future operations and capital needs and impair our ability to successfully execute our strategy and operate our business.\nA breach of any of the covenants in our debt instruments would result in an event of default thereunder if not promptly cured or waived. Any continuing default would permit the creditors to accelerate the related debt, which could also result in the acceleration of other debt containing a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision. In addition, an event of default under our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under our revolving credit facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our revolving credit facility or other secured debt, the lenders thereunder could cause the collateral agent to proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our debt, there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient assets to repay that debt, and our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would suffer.\nA violation of the terms of our Term ABS facilities or Warehouse facilities could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nUnder our Term ABS facilities and our Warehouse facilities, (1) we have various obligations and covenants as servicer and custodian of the Consumer Loans contributed thereto and in our individual capacity and (2) the special purpose subsidiaries to which we contribute Consumer Loans have various obligations and covenants. A violation of any of these obligations or covenants by us or the special purpose subsidiaries, respectively, may result in our being unable to obtain additional funding under our Warehouse facilities, the termination of our servicing rights and the loss of servicing fees, and may result in amounts outstanding under our Term ABS financings and our Warehouse facilities becoming immediately due and payable. In addition, the violation of any financial covenant under our revolving secured line of credit facility is an event of default or termination event under certain of the Term ABS facilities and our Warehouse facilities. The lack of availability from any or all of these Term ABS facilities and Warehouse facilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nOur substantial debt could negatively impact our business, prevent us from satisfying our debt obligations and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could have negative consequences, including the following:\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing for Consumer Loan assignments, working capital, debt refinancing or other purposes could be impaired;\n\u2022a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, reducing funds available for other purposes;\n\u2022we may be vulnerable to interest rate increases, as some of our borrowings, including those under our revolving credit facility, bear interest at variable rates;\n\u2022we could be more vulnerable to adverse developments in our industry or in general economic conditions;\n\u2022we may be restricted from taking advantage of business opportunities or making strategic acquisitions; and\n\u2022we may be limited in our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding debt and fund operations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such debt.\nOur ability to make payments of principal and interest on indebtedness will depend in part on our cash flows from operations, which are subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operations sufficient to permit us to meet our debt service obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that any refinancing will be possible or that any asset sales or additional financing can be completed on acceptable terms or at all.\nInterest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our borrowing costs, profitability and liquidity.\nOur profitability may be directly affected by the level of and fluctuations in interest rates, whether caused by changes in economic conditions or other factors, which affect our borrowing costs. Our profitability and liquidity could be materially adversely affected during any period of higher interest rates. We monitor the interest rate environment and employ strategies designed to partially mitigate the impact of increases in interest rates. We can provide no assurance, however, that our strategies will mitigate the impact of increases in interest rates.\nThe phaseout of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate, could result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, or the FCA (the authority that regulates LIBOR), announced that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The FCA-regulated and authorized administrator of LIBOR indicated in 2020 that U.S.-dollar LIBOR for certain maturities would continue to be available until the end of June 2023. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established or if alternative rates or benchmarks will be adopted. Our revolving secured line of credit, certain of our Warehouse facilities, one of our Term ABS financings and our interest rate cap agreements utilize LIBOR as a benchmark for calculating the applicable interest rates. We have entered into amendments for certain of those LIBOR-based facilities to provide for transitioning to a LIBOR alternative. Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, the elimination of LIBOR or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, may require us to renegotiate or amend those facilities that do not already provide for transitioning to a LIBOR alternative and, even if applied in a manner consistent with any transition provisions, may adversely affect the interest rates available to us and result in higher borrowing costs. Such higher borrowing costs or any other similar increases in the cost of capital to us resulting from the phaseout or replacement of LIBOR could materially adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nReduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit rating agencies evaluate us, and their ratings of our debt and creditworthiness are based on a number of factors. These factors include our financial strength and other factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. As the financial services industry and the financial markets periodically face difficulties, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. Failure to maintain those ratings could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain financing.\nWe may incur substantially more debt and other liabilities. This could exacerbate further the risks associated with our current debt levels.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the terms of our debt instruments contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, these restrictions are subject to exemptions that could permit us to incur a substantial amount of additional debt. In addition, our debt instruments do not prevent us from incurring liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness as defined for purposes of those debt instruments. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the risks associated with our having substantial debt could intensify.\nThe conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets may adversely affect lenders with which we have relationships, causing us to incur additional costs and reducing our sources of liquidity, which may adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nPeriodically, there has been uncertainty in the global capital markets and the overall economy. Such uncertainty can result in disruptions in the financial sector and affect lenders with which we have relationships. Disruptions in the financial sector may increase our exposure to credit risk and adversely affect the ability of lenders to perform under the terms of their lending arrangements with us. Failure by our lenders to perform under the terms of our lending arrangements could cause us to incur additional costs that may adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future disruptions in the financial sector will not occur that could have similar adverse effects on our business.\nInformation Technology and Cybersecurity Risks\nOur dependence on technology could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAll Consumer Loans submitted to us for assignment are processed through our internet-based CAPS application, which enables our Dealers to interact with our proprietary credit scoring system. Our Consumer Loan servicing platform is also technology based. We rely on these systems to record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately and believe that these systems provide us with a competitive advantage. All of these systems are dependent upon computer and telecommunications equipment, software systems and Internet access. The temporary or permanent loss of any components of these systems through hardware failures, software errors, operating malfunctions, the vulnerability of the Internet or otherwise could interrupt our business operations, harm our business and adversely affect our competitive advantage. In addition, our competitors could create or acquire systems similar to ours, which would adversely affect our competitive advantage.\nOur systems, and the equipment, software and Internet access on which they depend, may be subject to cyber attacks, security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents. Although the cybersecurity incidents we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, there can be no assurance that cybersecurity incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future.\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect our technology and proprietary information, including copyrights and a comprehensive information security program. However, these measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information, which would adversely affect us. In addition, our competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems, processes or technologies infringe their intellectual property rights.\nOur ability to integrate computer and telecommunications technologies into our business is essential to our success. Computer and telecommunications technologies are evolving rapidly and are characterized by short product life cycles. We may not be successful in anticipating, managing or adopting technological changes on a timely basis. While we believe that our existing information systems are sufficient to meet our current demands and continued expansion, our future growth may require additional investment in these systems. We cannot assure that adequate capital resources will be available to us at the appropriate time.\nOur use of electronic contracts could impact our ability to perfect our ownership or security interest in Consumer Loans.\nOur systems permit origination and assignment of Consumer Loans in electronic form. We have engaged a TPP to facilitate the process of creating, establishing control of and storing electronic contracts in a manner that enables us to perfect our ownership or security interest in the electronic contracts by satisfying the requirements for \u201ccontrol\u201d of electronic chattel paper under the Uniform Commercial Code.\nAlthough the law governing the perfection of ownership and security interests in electronic contracts was enacted in 2001, the statutory requirements for the relevant control arrangements have not been meaningfully tested in court. In addition, market practices regarding control of electronic contracts are still developing. As a result, there is a risk that the systems employed by us or any TPP to maintain control of the electronic contracts may not be sufficient as a matter of law to give us a perfected ownership or security interest in the Consumer Loans evidenced by electronic contracts. In addition, technological failure, including failure in the security or access restrictions with respect to the systems, and operational failure, such as the failure to implement and maintain adequate internal controls and procedures, could also affect our ability to obtain or maintain a perfected ownership or security interest in the Consumer Loans evidenced by electronic contracts (or the priority of such interests). Our failure or inability to perfect our ownership or security interest in the Consumer Loans could materially adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nFailure to properly safeguard confidential consumer and team member information could subject us to liability, decrease our profitability and damage our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our consumers and team members, on our computer networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy.\nIf third parties or our team members are able to breach our network security, the network security of a third party that we share information with or otherwise misappropriate our consumers\u2019 and team members\u2019 personal information, or if we give third parties or our team members improper access to our consumers\u2019 and team members\u2019 personal information, we could be subject to liability. This liability could include identity theft or other similar fraud-related claims. This liability could also include claims for other misuses or losses of personal information, including for unauthorized marketing purposes. Other liabilities could include claims alleging misrepresentation of our privacy and data security practices.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to secure online transmission of confidential consumer and team member information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect sensitive consumer transaction data. A party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect against, or alleviate problems caused by, security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents. Although we have experienced cybersecurity incidents from time to time that have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, there can be no assurance that a cyber attack, security breach or other cybersecurity incident will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. Our security measures are designed to protect against security breaches, but our failure to prevent security breaches could subject us to liability, decrease our profitability and damage our reputation.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nLitigation we are involved in from time to time may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of the consumer-oriented nature of the industry in which we operate and uncertainties with respect to the application of various laws and regulations in some circumstances, we are subject to various consumer claims, litigation and regulatory investigations seeking damages, fines and statutory penalties, based upon, among other things, usury, disclosure inaccuracies, wrongful repossession, violations of bankruptcy stay provisions, certificate of title disputes, fraud and breach of contract. As the assignee of Consumer Loans originated by Dealers, we may also be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against Dealers. We may also have disputes and litigation with Dealers. The claims may allege, among other theories of liability, that we breached our Dealer servicing agreement. We may also have disputes and litigation with vendors and other third parties. The claims may allege, among other theories of liability, that we breached a license agreement or contract. The damages, fines and penalties that may be claimed by consumers, regulatory agencies, Dealers, vendors or other third parties in these types of matters can be substantial. The relief requested by plaintiffs varies but may include requests for compensatory, statutory and punitive damages and injunctive relief, and plaintiffs may seek treatment as purported class actions. A significant judgment against us in connection with any litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nFor a description of significant litigation to which we are a party, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nChanges in tax laws and the resolution of uncertain income tax matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.\nWe are subject to income tax in many of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in statutory income tax rates and other adverse changes in applicable law in these jurisdictions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. We provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. Please see the Critical Accounting Estimates - Uncertain Tax Positions section in Item 7 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. We adjust these liabilities as a result of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Such payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.\nThe regulations to which we are or may become subject could result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nReference should be made to Item 1.
