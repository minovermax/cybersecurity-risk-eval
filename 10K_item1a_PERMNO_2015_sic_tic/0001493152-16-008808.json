{"cik": "1347022", "company": "POSITIVEID Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risks and the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d could materially affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. If any these risks materialize, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Operations and Business of PositiveID\nWe have a history of losses and expect to incur additional losses in the future. We are unable to predict the extent of future losses or when we will become profitable.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we experienced net losses of $11.4 million and $7.2 million, respectively and our accumulated deficit at December 31, 2015 was $144.2 million. Until our ENG, Caregiver, Firefly and M-BAND businesses and products are profitable on a combined basis, we do not anticipate generating significant operating profits. We have submitted, or are in the process of submitting, bids on various potential new U.S. Government contracts; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any such new or other contracts.\nWe expect to continue to incur operating losses for the near future. Our ability in the future to achieve or sustain profitability is based on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nOur financial statements indicate conditions exist that raise substantial doubt as to whether we will continue as a going concern.\nOur annual audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 indicate conditions exist that raise substantial doubt as to whether we will continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing to fund the continued development of products, and working capital requirements. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment.\nGovernment contracts and subcontracts are generally subject to a competitive bidding process that may affect our ability to win contract awards or renewals in the future.\nWe bid on government contracts through a formal competitive process in which we may have many competitors. If awarded, upon expiration, these contracts may be subject, once again, to a competitive renewal process if applicable. We may not be successful in winning contract awards or renewals in the future. Our failure to renew or replace existing contracts when they expire could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nContracts and subcontracts with United States government agencies that we may be awarded will be subject to competition and will be awarded on the basis of technical merit, personnel qualifications, experience, and price. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially affected to the extent that U.S. government agencies believe our competitors offer a more attractive combination of the foregoing factors. In addition, government demand and payment for our products may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting demand for our products. In particular, the, next generation BioWatch program is potentially a very large program, under which we intend to bid as a subcontractor to The Boeing Company. Our success in this process is an important factor in our ability to increase stockholder value.\nCompliance with changing regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.\nThere have been changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and new regulations promulgated by the SEC. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Our board members and executive officers could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm our business. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, we could be subject to liability under applicable laws or our reputation may be harmed.\nChanges in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FDA, other federal, state and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. Adverse decisions or new or amended regulations or mandates adopted by any of these regulatory or legislative bodies could negatively impact our operations by, among other things, causing unexpected or changed capital investments, lost revenues, increased costs of doing business, and could limit our ability to engage in certain sales or marketing activities.\nWe depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively, and, if we are unable to hire, retain or motivate qualified personnel, our ability to design, develop, market and sell our systems could be harmed.\nOur future success depends, in part, on certain key employees, including William J. Caragol, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Lyle Probst, our President, and on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel may seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly operations, finance, accounting, sales and marketing personnel, may also seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future.\nWe May Be unable to make or successfully integrate acquisitions.\nOur business and growth strategies depend in large part on our ability to identify and acquire suitable companies. Delays or failures in acquiring new companies would materially and adversely affect our planned growth.\nStrategic acquisitions, investments and alliances are intended to expand our ability to offer, high quality detection and diagnostic products and services. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions, investments and alliances, we may be unable to grow our business significantly or may record asset impairment charges in the future. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance that we may undertake in the future will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf our ability to identify suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance, if at all;\n\u25cf our ability to finance any future acquisition, investment or alliance on terms acceptable to us, if at all;\n\u25cf whether we are able to establish an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all;\n\u25cf the strength of the other company\u2019s underlying technology and ability to execute;\n\u25cf intellectual property and pending litigation related to these technologies;\n\u25cf regulatory approvals and reimbursement levels, if any, of the acquired products, if any; and\n\u25cf our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and businesses with our existing business, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects.\nAny potential future acquisitions we consummate will be dilutive, possibly substantially, to the equity ownership interests of our shareholders since we intend to pay for such acquisitions by issuing shares of our common stock, and also may be dilutive to our earnings per share, if any.\nOur acquisition strategy may not have the desired result, and notwithstanding effecting numerous acquisitions, we still may be unable to achieve profitability or, if profitability should be achieved, to sustain it.\nWe will continue to incur the expenses of complying with public company reporting requirements.\nWe have an obligation to continue to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which includes the filing with the SEC of periodic reports, proxy statements and other documents relating to our business, financial conditions and other matters, even though compliance with such reporting requirements is economically burdensome at this time.\nDirectors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliated entities own a significant percentage of our capital stock, and they may make decisions that you do not consider to be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nAs of April 6, 2016, our current directors and executive officers beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 81% of our outstanding voting securities, including 38.6% owned by our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, if some or all of them acted together, they would have the ability to exert substantial influence over the election of the Board and the outcome of issues requiring approval by our stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company that may be favored by other stockholders. This could prevent transactions in which stockholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices.\nThe Company\u2019s officers, directors and management hold preferred shares that give them voting control of the Company.\nFrom September 30, 2013 through April 6, 2016, the Company has issued 2,025 shares of Series I Preferred Stock to its officers, directors and management for management and director compensation and payment of deferred obligations. Each of the Series I preferred is convertible into the Company\u2019s Common Stock, at stated value plus accrued dividends, at the closing bid price on the issuance date, any time at the option of the holder and by the Company in the event that the Company\u2019s closing stock price exceeds 400% of the conversion price for twenty consecutive trading days. The Series I Preferred Stock has voting rights equivalent to twenty-five votes per common share equivalent.\nThe Series I preferred shares issued to all four current members of the Board and the three non-directors who are part of management are as follows:\nAs of April 6, 2016, our officers, directors and management now have an aggregate of 2,125,877,956 votes on any matter brought to a vote of the holders of our common stock, including an aggregate of 2,120,906,602 votes, or 81% of the total vote, through the ownership of Series I Preferred Stock, and 4,971,354 votes through the ownership of shares of our common stock. As a result, our officers, directors, and management have voting control over the 2,619,890,654 of the outstanding voting shares of the Company.\nAs a result, our Board may, at any time, authorize the issuance of additional common or preferred stock without common stockholder approval, subject only to the total number of authorized common and preferred shares set forth in our certificate of incorporation. The terms of equity securities issued by us in future transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include dividend and/or liquidation preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect. Since management has voting control over the Company, it also has the ability to approve any increase in the amount of authorized shares of common or preferred stock thus, there are no limitations on management\u2019s ability to continue to make dilutive issuances of securities.\nRisks Related to Our Product Development Efforts\nWe anticipate future losses and will require additional financing, and our failure to obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe anticipate future losses and therefore may be dependent on additional financing to execute our business plan. In particular, we will require additional capital to continue to conduct the research and development and obtain regulatory clearances and approvals necessary to bring our products to market and to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities for existing and future products. Our operating plan may change, and we may need additional funds sooner than anticipated to meet our operational needs and capital requirements for product development, clinical trials and commercialization. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the research and development of our molecular diagnostic products, the costs of expanding sales and marketing infrastructure and manufacturing operations; the number and types of future products we develop and commercialize; the costs, timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews associated with our current and future product candidates; the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; and the extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses.\nOur industry changes rapidly as a result of technological and product developments, which may quickly render our product candidates less desirable or even obsolete. If we are unable or unsuccessful in supplementing our product offerings, our revenue and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nThe industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change. The introduction of new technologies in the market, including the delay in the adoption of these technologies, as well as new alternatives for the delivery of products and services will continue to have a profound effect on competitive conditions in this market. We may not be able to develop and introduce new products, services and enhancements that respond to technological changes on a timely basis. If our product candidates are not accepted by the market as anticipated, if at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nIndustry and Business Risks Related to E-N-G Mobile Systems, Inc.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur revenues and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year-to-year because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n\u25cf our ability to accurately forecast revenues and appropriately plan our expenses;\n\u25cf the impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth;\n\u25cf our ability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u25cf our ability to attract new customers;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully enter new markets and manage our expansion;\n\u25cf the effects of increased competition in our business;\n\u25cf our ability to keep pace with changes in technology and our competitors;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully manage any future acquisitions of businesses, solutions or technologies;\n\u25cf the success of our marketing efforts;\n\u25cf interruptions in service and any related impact on our reputation;\n\u25cf the attraction and retention of qualified employees and key personnel;\n\u25cf our ability to protect our intellectual property;\n\u25cf costs associated with defending intellectual property infringement and other claims;\n\u25cf the effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our internal controls; and\n\u25cf changes in government regulation affecting our business.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance, and any unfavorable changes in these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe may face strong competition from larger, established companies.\nWe likely will face intense competition from other companies that provide the same or similar custom specialty vehicle manufacturing and other services that compete with acquired businesses, virtually all of whom can be expected to have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger installed customer bases and significantly more financial resources, R&D facilities and manufacturing and marketing experience than we have. There can be no assurance that developments by our potential competitors will not render our existing and future products or services obsolete. In addition, we expect to face competition from new entrants into the custom specialty vehicle business. As the demand for products and services grows and new markets are exploited, we expect that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products and services. We may not have sufficient resources to maintain our research and development, marketing, sales and customer support efforts on a competitive basis. Additionally, we may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain a competitive advantage with respect to our products and services. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer product orders, obsolete technology and reduced operating margins, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowth may place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure.\nWe plan for substantial growth in our business, and this growth would place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. If our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we will need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to meet customer demand. The expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources in advance of an increase in the volume of business, with no assurance that the volume of business will increase. Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our customers and meet their expected delivery schedules, develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures and recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel.\nManaging our growth will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nIndustry and Business Risks Related to Thermomedics, Inc.\nCost and quality issues might arise from our dependence on a third-party, sole source manufacturer.\nWe currently buy our products from one third-party, sole source supplier who produces our products in its plant in Taiwan. Although we have the right to engage other manufacturers, we have not done so. Accordingly, our reliance on this supplier involves certain risks, including:\n\u25cf The cost of our products might increase, for reasons such as inflation and increases in the price of the precious metals, if any, or other internal parts used to make them, which could cause our cost of goods to increase and reduce our gross margin and profitability if any; and\n\u25cf Poor quality could adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our products.\nAny of these uncertainties also could adversely affect our business reputation and otherwise impair our profitability and ability to compete.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively.\nOur competition includes Welch Allyn, Braun and Exergen, all of which market a line or lines of thermometers. Each competitor has national distribution and a longer operating history than we do; and these brands have greater brand name recognition and significantly greater financial, technical sales, marketing, distribution and research and development resources. We may be unable to compete successfully against this competition.\nOur research and development may be unsuccessful; our next generation products may not be developed, or if developed may fail to win commercial acceptance.\nOur business is characterized by extensive research and development, and rapid technological change. Developments by other companies of new or improved products or technologies, especially of thermometers for use by consumers on pet dogs may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales. We should, subject to having adequate financial resources (which we currently do not possess), devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies, apply our technologies cost-effectively across our product lines and markets and, attract and retain skilled electrical engineering and other development personnel. If we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to develop new products and improve current product offerings, we are focusing our research and development programs largely on the development of next-generation models intended for the professional health care markets, principally with greater accuracy than our current models. If we are unable to develop, launch these products as anticipated, and have them accepted commercially, our ability to expand our market position may be materially adversely impacted. Further, we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, medical treatment technologies and other medical devices. Expanding our focus beyond our current business would be expensive and time-consuming. There can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on terms favorable to us, or that these opportunities will achieve commercial feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of these technologies or our decision to reduce our investments my adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growth.\nProduct shortages may arise if our contract manufacturer fails to comply with government regulations.\nMedical device manufacturers are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with its Qualify System Regulation requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the Federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require a manufacturer to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through period inspections by the FDA. Our manufacturer and supplier is International Standards Organization (\u201cISO\u201d) certified, but if it were to fail to adhere to quality system regulations or ISO requirements, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur medical devices may not meet government regulations.\nOur products and development activities are subject to regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDC Act\u201d), and, if we should sell our products abroad, by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDC Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. The FDA is reviewing its clearance process in an effort to make it more rigorous, which may require additional clinical data, if any, time and effort for product clearance. In addition, most major markets for medical devices outside the U.S. require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could:\n\u25cf Take a significant period of time;\n\u25cf Require the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u25cf Involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance;\n\u25cf Require changes to products; and\n\u25cf Result in limitations on the indicated uses of products.\n\t\nCountries around the world have adopted more stringent regulatory requirements that have added or are expected to add to the delays and uncertainties associated with new product releases, as well as the clinical, if any, and regulatory costs of supporting those releases. Even after products have received marketing approval or clearance, product approvals and clearances by the FDA can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence unforeseen problems following initial approval. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required clearances for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements.\nIn addition, regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, those changes might have on our business. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. We also may initiate field actions as a result of our manufacturer\u2019s failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur intellectual property may not be protectable.\nThe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. Consumers historical move quickly to new products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However, intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. Furthermore, appellate courts can overturn lower court patent decisions.\nWe face intellectual property risks that may negatively affect our brand names, reputation, revenues, and potential profitability.\nIn our second-generation products we will be depending upon a variety of methods and techniques that we regard as proprietary trade secrets. We are also dependent upon a variety of trademarks and designs to promote brand name development and recognition, and we rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and unfair competition and other intellectual property laws to protect our rights to such intellectual property. However, to the extent that our products violate the proprietary right of others we may be subject to damage awards or judgments prohibiting the use of our intellectual property. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d for a description of a pending legal proceeding seeking to invalidate one of our design patents. In addition, our rights in our intellectual property, even if registered, may not be enforceable against any prior users of similar intellectual property. Furthermore, if we lose or fail to enforce any of our proprietary rights, our brand names, reputation, revenues and potential profitability may be negatively affected.\nIn addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors may be parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases, but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceeding and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies.\nPatents and other proprietary rights are and will continue to be essential to our business, and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovations to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We pursue a policy of generally seeking patent protection in the U.S. for patentable design or subject matter in our devices and attempt to review third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others. We own three U.S. design patents and have one U.S. utility patent application pending. We are not a party to any license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash, cross-licensing rights or royalty payments. No assurance can be made that any pending or future patent application will result in the issuance of patents, or that any future patents issued to, or licensed by, us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors. In addition, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, if any, trade secrets or know-how or to assert them against claimed infringement by others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming, and no assurances can be given that any lawsuit will be successful.\nThe invalidation of key patent or proprietary rights that we may own, or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results in operations.\nOur trademarks are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nOur trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Our trademarks \u201cThermomedics,\u201d \u201cBabytemp,\u201d \u201cTemp4sure,\u201d Tempmature,\u201d \u201cElitemp\u201d, \u201cCaregiver\u201d, and \u201cTouchFree\u201d are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Protecting these intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming, and any unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive for us to do business and which also could harm our operating results.\nProduct warranties and product liabilities could be costly.\nWe typically warrant the workmanship and materials used in the products we sell. Failure of the products to operate properly or to meet specifications may increase our costs by requiring replacement or monetary reimbursement to the end user. To the extent we are unable to make a corresponding warranty claim against the manufacturer of the defective product, we would bear the loss associated with such warranties. In the ordinary course of our business, we may be subject to product liability claims alleging that products we sold failed or had adverse effects. We maintain liability insurance at a level which we believe to be adequate. A successful claim in excess of the policy limits of the liability insurance could materially adversely affect our business. There can be no assurance, however, that recourse against a manufacturer would be successful, or that our manufacturer maintains adequate insurance or otherwise would be able to pay such liability.\nIndustry and Business Risks Related to Our Legacy Healthcare Businesses\nThe sale and license of our legacy healthcare products may not produce royalty streams.\nIn 2013, we licensed the assets related to our iglucose technology to Smart Glucose Meter and in 2015 we licensed our breath glucose detection system and its underlying patent, which was granted in 2014. Pursuant to these agreements, we are due royalties based on future product sales, if any. Should these businesses not generate significant revenues, we will not achieve royalty streams from these sales and licenses.\nImplantation of our implantable microchip may be found to cause risks to a person\u2019s health, which could adversely affect sales of our systems that incorporate the implantable microchip.\nThe implantation of the VeriChip, which we sold to VeriTeQ, may be found, or be perceived, to cause risks to a person\u2019s health. Potential or perceived risks include adverse tissue reactions, migration of the microchip and infection from implantation. There have been articles published asserting, despite numerous studies to the contrary, that the implanted microchip causes malignant tumor formation in laboratory animals. If more people are implanted with our implantable microchip, it is possible that these and other risks to health will manifest themselves. Actual or perceived risks to a person\u2019s health associated with the microchip implantation process could result in negative publicity could damage our business reputation, leading to loss in sales of our other systems targeted at the healthcare market which would harm our business and negatively affect our prospects.\nIn connection with its acquisition of the VeriChip business, VeriTeQ agreed to indemnify us for any liabilities relating to the implantable microchip. Further, we are aware that VeriTeQ has sold the assets of the business to an unaffiliated third party who is using it as an identification device inside of a cosmetic implant, which does not involve direct in vivo use in people. If VeriTeQ or the buyer of the assets is unable to fulfill indemnity obligations, we could be responsible for payment of such liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress the market price of our common stock and cause stockholders to experience dilution.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issuable on the conversion of convertible notes payable. We may seek additional capital through one or more additional equity or convertible debt transactions in 2016; however, such transactions will be subject to market conditions and there can be no assurance any such transaction will be completed.\nCurrent stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock issued pursuant to convertible preferred stock and debt instruments.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders and the purchasers of our common stock offered hereby. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 3,900,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 3,895,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights to be determined by our Board. As of April 6, 2016, there are 498,984,053 shares of our common stock, 2,025 of our Series I preferred stock and 125 of our Series J preferred stock outstanding. There are 65,896,288 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option agreements. We also have 13,490,000 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants. We also have convertible notes with approximate principal and accrued interest balances of $8,104,015 as of April 6, 2016. These notes and our Series I preferred stock are convertible into common stock in the future at prices determined at the time of conversion. The Series I, Series J and convertible notes would convert into shares of common stock, based on the closing bid price of $0.0123 on April 6, 2016, as follows:\n(1) Represents liquidation value, including accrued dividends, on (i) 413 shares of Series I, converted at $0.036; (ii) 75 shares of Series I converted at $0.0250; (iii) 512 shares of Series I converted at $0.0245; (iv) 625 shares of Series I, converted at $0.027, which are fixed conversion prices; and (v) 400 shares if Series I, converted at $0.207\n(2) Represents liquidation value on 125 shares of Series J converted at the closing bid price of $0.0123 on April 6, 2016 at discounts of 25%, 50% and 75% from the closing price on April 6, 2016.\n(3) The convertible notes are convertible into common stock of the company at prices determined, in the future, at the time of conversion, at discounts of between 25% and 40% of the market price or at the lesser of a fixed amount or discount to market. This table includes common shares conversions at the closing bid price of $0.0123 on April 6, 2016, and at discounts of 25%, 50% and 75% from the closing bid price on April 6, 2016.\nAny future issuance of our equity or equity-backed securities may dilute then-current stockholders\u2019 ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of our equity securities, because our assets would be owned by a larger pool of outstanding equity. As described above, we may need to raise additional capital through public or private offerings of our common or preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common or preferred stock. We may also issue such securities in connection with hiring or retaining employees and consultants (including stock options issued under our equity incentive plans), as payment to providers of goods and services, in connection with future acquisitions or for other business purposes. Our Board may at any time authorize the issuance of additional common or preferred stock without common stockholder approval, subject only to the total number of authorized common and preferred shares set forth in our certificate of incorporation. The terms of equity securities issued by us in future transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include dividend and/or liquidation preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect. Also, the future issuance of any such additional shares of common or preferred stock or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. There can be no assurance that any such future issuances will not be at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of the common stock are then traded.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock.\nIn July 2008 we declared, and in August 2008 we paid, a special cash dividend of $15.8 million on our capital stock. Any future determination with respect to the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, terms of financing arrangements and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. In addition, our Certificates of Designation for shares of Series I and Series J Preferred Stock prohibit the payment of cash dividends on our common stock while any such shares of preferred stock are outstanding.\nOur shares may be defined as \u201cpenny stock,\u201d the rules imposed on the sale of the shares may affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all.\nShares of our common stock may be defined as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under the Exchange Act, and rules of the SEC. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 jointly with spouse, or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker-dealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement prior to the sale. In addition, the broker-dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the SEC. Consequently, the penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to make a market in or trade our common stock and may also affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase in this offering in the public markets.\nThe success and timing of development efforts, clinical trials, regulatory approvals, product introductions, collaboration and licensing arrangements, any termination of development efforts and other material events could cause volatility in our stock price.\nSince our common stock is thinly traded, its trading price is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to extreme fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including (but not necessarily limited to):\n\u25cf success or lack of success in being awarded, as a subcontractor to The Boeing Company, the next stage procurement related to the BioWatch system;\n\u25cf success or lack of success in being awarded research and development contracts with U.S. Government agencies, related to our Firefly Dx product, or otherwise;\n\u25cf success or lack of success being granted patents for its core biological diagnostic and detection technologies;\n\u25cf introduction of competitive products into the market;\n\u25cf receipt of payments of any royalty payments under the sale and licensing agreements related to our legacy healthcare products;\n\u25cf unfavorable publicity regarding us or our products;\n\u25cf termination of development efforts of any product under development or any development or collaboration agreement.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also significantly affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91816, "SIC": 3711, "TIC": "PSID"}
