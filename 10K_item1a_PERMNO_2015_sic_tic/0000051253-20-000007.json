Some of these risks may cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we presently anticipate. Below are material risks we have identified that could adversely affect our business. How we react to material future developments, as well as how our competitors and customers react to those developments, could also affect our future results.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe may not realize all the benefits anticipated from the Frutarom acquisition, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe success of the Frutarom acquisition ultimately depends on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from the transaction. Since the Frutarom acquisition, we have benefited from, and expect to continue to benefit from cost synergies through global footprint optimization across manufacturing, the realization of significant procurement synergies plus organizational and operational efficiencies in overhead expenses. We also expect to achieve revenue synergies by leveraging customer relationships across a much broader customer base and cross-selling legacy IFF and Frutarom technology and capabilities. If we fail to realize all the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Frutarom acquisition, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe integration of our legacy IFF business and Frutarom\u2019s business is a costly and time-consuming process, and we may face significant implementation challenges that will impact our ability to realize the expected benefits from the acquisition, including without limitation:\n\u2022potential disruption of, or reduced growth in, our historical core businesses, due to diversion of management attention as well as financial and other resources from our historical core business and uncertainty with our current customer and supplier relationships;\n\u2022loss of business as a result of changes in customer and/or competitor behaviors following the Frutarom acquisition, including our inability to keep certain customer accounts of Frutarom who may be direct competitors to IFF, or our need to deprioritize our business activities in certain markets based on market conditions;\n\u2022difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects;\n\u2022challenges arising from the expansion of our product offerings into adjacencies with which we have limited experience, including functional foods and nutrition;\n\u2022the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration;\n\u2022coordinating and integrating research and development teams across technologies and products to enhance product development while reducing costs;\n\u2022coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our capabilities and the direction of product development;\n\u2022ensuring regulatory compliance, quality. safety and sustainability standards across an organization of increased scale and complexity;\n\u2022retaining and efficiently managing our significantly expanded and decentralized customer base;\n\u2022the assumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of Frutarom;\n\u2022unanticipated issues or higher than expected costs in consolidating and integrating corporate, information technology, finance and administrative infrastructures, and integrating and harmonizing business systems;\n\u2022combining and optimizing our manufacturing facilities and global supply chain as well as leveraging customer relationships for cross-selling opportunities;\n\u2022aligning compliance, quality, as well as safety and sustainability standards across operations;\n\u2022aligning processes, policies, procedures, technologies, operations, employee benefits, information technologies and systems across operations;\n\u2022difficulties in managing a larger and more complex combined company, addressing differences in business culture and retaining key personnel; and\n\u2022managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company.\nSome of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them if not successfully managed could result in increased costs and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, as well as reputational harm and decreases in the amount of expected revenue which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the anticipated benefits from the Frutarom acquisition are not fully realized, or take longer to realize than expected, the value of our common stock, revenues, levels of expenses and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Frutarom acquisition resulted, and may continue to result, in significant costs, charges or other liabilities that could adversely affect the financial results of the combined company.\nFollowing the acquisition of Frutarom, our financial results were adversely affected by restructuring charges, cash expenses and non-cash accounting charges incurred in connection with the acquisition. We expect to record total pretax restructuring charges related to the Frutarom acquisition of approximately $65 million, of which $10.4 million have been recorded since closing of the transaction through December 31, 2019, comprised of approximately $6.1 million of severance and related benefit costs; $0.5 million of asset write-downs and write-offs; and $3.7 million of costs associated with exit and disposal activities. In addition, there are many processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that are being integrated across our organization that will result in costs, including financial advisory, tax, information technology, legal, consulting and other professional advisory fees associated with these integration activities. Costs and expenses incurred in connection with the integration limit resources that may otherwise be available for investment in research and development and capital expenditures.\nAs a result of the acquisition, we assumed all of Frutarom\u2019s liabilities, including unknown and contingent liabilities. Due to the nature of the transaction and the characteristics of Frutarom, our ability to conduct extensive due diligence was limited and we may subsequently identify unknown liabilities, including those that Frutarom assumed in its prior acquisitions that are not currently probable or estimable. Prior to our acquisition, Frutarom completed 47 acquisitions since 2011, including 22 since the beginning of 2016. If we do not properly assess the scope of these liabilities or if these liabilities are neither probable nor estimable at this time, our future financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated reserves or charges, unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting charges, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe may fail to realize the expected cost savings and increased efficiencies from or stay within our estimated costs of the Frutarom integration and our ongoing optimization of our manufacturing facilities may not be as effective as we anticipate.\nOur ability to realize anticipated cost savings and synergies from the Frutarom manufacturing rationalization may be affected by a variety of factors which may impose significant risks to us and which may be out of our control, including:\n\u2022our ability to accurately estimate costs in multiple jurisdictions related to the consolidation, updating or closing of manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022our ability to successfully and efficiently manufacture the relocated product lines at a different manufacturing facility;\n\u2022our ability to effectively reduce overhead and integrate and retain employees of the relocated operations;\n\u2022difficulties in implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u2022integrating newly acquired manufacturing, distribution and technology facilities;\n\u2022potential strains on our personnel, systems and resources and diversion of attention from other priorities; and\n\u2022unforeseen or contingent liabilities of the relocated operations, including tax liabilities.\nActual charges, costs and adjustments arising from these activities may vary materially from our estimates, and may require cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in excess of forecasted amounts, which could offset any such savings and other synergies and therefore could have an adverse effect on our margins.\nFurthermore, as part of our ongoing strategy, we seek to enhance our manufacturing efficiency and align our geographic manufacturing footprint with our expectations of future growth and technology needs. For example, we are in the process of relocating one of our Fragrance Ingredients facilities in China and constructing new facilities in India and Indonesia. In addition, in connection with the Frutarom integration, we are consolidating, updating and/or closing manufacturing facilities to achieve synergies and align our manufacturing footprint.\nOur incurrence of additional debt to pay the cash portion of the Frutarom consideration increased our financial leverage and could adversely affect our future cash flows and cost of capital.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Frutarom, we borrowed approximately $3.3 billion of additional debt, thereby significantly increasing our leverage. As of December 31, 2019, our total debt consisted of $4.4 billion. There may be circumstances in which required payments of principal and/or interest on our debt could adversely affect our cash flows, our operating results or our ability to return capital to our shareholders. Furthermore, our degree of leverage could adversely affect our future credit ratings. If we are unable to maintain or improve our current investment grade rating, it could adversely affect our future cost of funding, liquidity and access to capital markets. In addition, our current level of leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing, and our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities, including large acquisitions. Our level of indebtedness as well as our failure to comply with covenants under our debt instruments, could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nFailure to successfully establish and manage acquisitions, collaborations, joint ventures or partnerships could adversely affect our growth.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business and/or growth objectives. If we are unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings, including any expected increase in revenues and operating results, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We may also incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that reduce our earnings.\nAdditionally, we also evaluate and enter into collaborations, joint ventures or partnerships from time to time to enhance our research and development efforts or expand our product portfolios and technology. The process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult and time-consuming to negotiate, document and implement. We may not be able to successfully negotiate such arrangements or the terms of the arrangements may not be as favorable as anticipated. Furthermore, our ability to generate revenues from such collaborations will depend on our partners\u2019 abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements and these collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner, or at all. In addition, from time to time, we have acquired, and we may acquire, only a majority interest in companies and provided or may provide earnouts for the former owners along with the ability, at our option, or obligation, at the former owners\u2019 option, to purchase the minority interests at a future date at an established price. These investments may have additional risks and may not be as efficient as other operations as we may have fiduciary or contractual obligations to the minority investors and may rely on former owners for the continuing operation of the acquired business. If we are unable to successfully establish and manage these collaborative relationships and majority investments it could adversely affect our future growth.\nOur business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer.\nThe markets in which we compete are highly competitive. We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multi-national and specialized flavors, fragrances, nutrition and specialty ingredients companies, as well as consumer product companies which may develop their own flavors, fragrances or ingredients. In the flavors industry, we also face increasing competition from ingredient suppliers that have expanded their portfolios to include flavor offerings. Some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product sub-segments, while others participate in many of our product sub-segments. In addition, some of our global competitors may have more resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can. Consolidation of our competitors may exacerbate these risks.\nAs we continue to enter into adjacent markets, such as cosmetic ingredients, functional foods, specialty fine ingredients and nutrition products, we may face greater competition-related risks in these markets than with our core historic flavor and fragrances businesses. For example, the specialty fine ingredients market is more price sensitive than the flavors market and is characterized by relatively lower profit margins. Some fine ingredients products are less unique and more replaceable than competitors\u2019 products. There is no assurance that operating margins will remain at current levels, which could substantially impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCompetition in our business is based, among other things, on innovation, product quality, regulatory compliance, pricing, quality of customer service, the support provided by marketing and application groups, and understanding of consumers. It is difficult for us to predict the timing, scale and success of our competitors\u2019 actions in these areas. In particular, the discovery and development of new flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients, protection of our intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are critical to our ability to effectively compete in our business. Advancement in technologies have also enhanced the ability of our competitors to develop substitutable products. Increased competition by existing or future competitors, including aggressive price competition, could result in the loss of sales, reduced pricing and margin pressure and could adversely impact our sales and profitability.\nIf we are unable to successfully market to our expanded and diverse Taste customer base, our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected.\nAs a result of our acquisition of Frutarom, the number of our customers significantly increased and became more diverse. Our historical customer base was primarily comprised of large and medium-sized food, beverage and consumer products companies. As a result of the expansion of our Tastepoint initiative and the Frutarom acquisition, and based on 2019 sales, we currently have approximately 38,000 customers, approximately 65% of which are small and mid-sized companies. This substantial increase in and diversity of our customer base requires us to adjust, among other things, our product development, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, customer relationship and sales strategy as well as adapt corporate, information technology, finance and administrative infrastructures to support different go-to-market models. We may experience difficulty managing the growth of a portfolio of customers that is more diverse in terms of its geographical presence as well as with respect to the types of services they require and the infrastructure required to deliver our products. If we are unable to successfully gain market share or maintain our relationships with these customers, our future growth could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business. Significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals.\nAttracting, developing, and retaining talented employees, including our perfumers, scientists and flavorists, is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace. Furthermore, as we continue to focus on innovation, our need for scientists and other professionals will increase. An important factor in our ability to realize our anticipated benefits from the Frutarom acquisition is our ability to retain key employees at Frutarom. The ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy.\nCompetition for employees can be intense and if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and reward the acquired Frutarom employees or our current employees in our combined company, we may not be able to retain them. If we are unable to retain these employees or attract new employees in the future, our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our sales is generated from a limited number of large multi-national customers, which are currently under competitive pressures that may affect the demand for our products and profitability.\nDuring 2019, our 25 largest customers, each of which was a multi-national consumer products company, accounted for 38% of our sales. Large multi-national customers\u2019 market share, especially in the consumer product industry, continues to be pressured by new smaller companies and specialty players that cater to or are more adept at adjusting to the latest consumer trends, including towards natural products and clean labels, changes in the retail landscape (including e-commerce and consolidation), and increased competition from private labels, which have resulted and may continue to result in decreased demand for our products by such multi-national customers and volume erosion, especially in our Taste business. Furthermore, consolidations amongst our customers have resulted in larger and more sophisticated customers with greater buying power and additional negotiating strength. If such trends continue, our sales could be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace these sales.\nIn addition, large multi-national customers and, increasingly middle market customers, continue to utilize \u201ccore lists\u201d of suppliers to improve margins and profitability. Typically, these \u201ccore list\" suppliers are then given priority for new or modified products. Recently, these customers are making inclusion on their \u201ccore lists\u201d contingent upon a supplier providing more favorable commercial terms, including rebates, which could adversely affect our margins. We must either offer competitive cost-in-use solutions to secure and maintain inclusion on these \u201ccore lists\u201d or seek to manage the relationship without being on the \u201ccore-list.\u201d If we choose not to pursue \u201ccore-list\u201d status due to profitability concerns or if we are unable to obtain \u201ccore-list\u201d status, our ability to maintain our share of these customers\u2019 future purchases could be adversely affected and therefore our future results of operations.\nWe may not successfully develop and introduce new products that meet our customers\u2019 needs, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to differentiate ourselves and deliver growth in line with our Vision 2021 strategy largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that meet our customers\u2019 needs, and ultimately appeal to consumers. Innovation is a key element of our ability to develop and introduce new products. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in achieving our innovation goals, such as the development of new molecules, new and expanded delivery systems and other technologies. We currently spend approximately 6.7% of our sales on research and development; however this investment level may vary if available resources to invest in research and development are limited due to our ongoing integration and restructuring efforts. Our research and development investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to develop products that meet our customers\u2019 specifications, are at an acceptable cost and achieve acceptance by the targeted consumer market. Furthermore, there may be significant lag times from the time we incur research and development costs to the time that these research and development costs may result in increased revenue. Consequently, even when we \u201cwin\u201d a project, our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous customer, economic and other risks that are outside of our control, including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product, the level of promotional support for the launch, poor performance of our third-party vendors, anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands, or disruptive innovations by competitors.\nNatural disasters, public health crises (such as the recent Coronavirus outbreak), international conflicts, terrorist acts, labor strikes, political crisis, accidents and other events could adversely affect our business and financial results by disrupting development, manufacturing, distribution or sale of our products.\nAs a company engaged in the global development, manufacture and distribution of products, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, product quality control issues, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters, public health crises, such as pandemics or epidemics, international conflicts, terrorist acts and other external factors over which we have no control.\nWhile we operate research and development, manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world, many of these facilities are extremely specialized and certain of our research and development or creative laboratories facilities are uniquely situated to support our research and development efforts while certain of our manufacturing facilities are the sole location where a specific ingredient or product is produced. If our research and development activities or the manufacturing of ingredients or products were disrupted, the cost of relocating or replacing these activities or reformulating these ingredients or products may be substantial, which could result in production or development delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our margins, operating results and future growth.\nFor example, in December 2019, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China that has since spread to other regions in China and the rest of the world. To contain the outbreak, the Chinese central government extended the Lunar New Year holiday for one week and issued guidance pursuant to which local governments in China have taken temporary measures to limit large gatherings and impose travel restrictions. As a result, a portion of our manufacturing plants and offices in China were required to close for a week. The outbreak may result in additional or more extensive travel restrictions, closures, disruptions of businesses or facilities in China or other affected regions around the world or lead to social, economic, political or labor instability in the affected areas may impact our, our suppliers\u2019 or our customers\u2019 operations. The outbreak may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. At this point, the extent of such impact is uncertain.\nA disruption in our supply chain, including the inability to obtain ingredients and raw materials from third parties, could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn connection with our manufacture of our fragrance and flavor products, we often rely on third party suppliers for ingredients and raw materials that are integral to our manufacture of such compounds. Our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather conditions, climate change, as further discussed below, market conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control affecting us and/or our suppliers. Import alerts or specific country regulations may impair or delay our ability to obtain sufficient quantity of certain ingredients, raw materials and naturals at the relevant manufacturing facility. In addition, our ingredient or raw material suppliers, similar to us, are subject to risks, as applicable, inherent in agriculture, manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, disruption or loss of key research or manufacturing sites, product quality control, safety and environmental compliance issues, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters, global or local health crisis, international conflicts, terrorist acts and other external factors over which they have no control. These suppliers also could become insolvent or experience other financial distress. For example, in 2017, a fire at the manufacturing facility of BASF Group (\u201cBASF\u201d), one of\nour suppliers, caused them to declare a force majeure and has resulted in industry disruption due to the lack of availability of certain ingredients used in many fragrance compounds.\nThese risks are enhanced since we often rely on a limited number of suppliers for particular ingredients. If our suppliers are unable to supply us with sufficient quantities of ingredients and raw materials to meet our needs, we would need to seek alternative sources of such materials or pursue our own production of such ingredients or direct acquisition of such raw materials. However, for certain of our ingredients and raw materials we rely on a limited number of suppliers where there are not readily available alternatives. If we are unable to obtain or manufacture alternative sources of such ingredients or raw materials at a similar cost, we would seek to (i) reformulate our compounds and/or (ii) increase pricing to reflect the higher supply cost. However, if we are not able to successfully implement any of these alternatives, we could experience disruptions in production, increased cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross margin or reduced sales, especially if our competitors were able to more successfully adjust to such market disruption. At the same time, industry-wide supply disruptions, such as the one caused by the BASF incident, may lead to broader market shortages and sales volatility. Such fluctuations and decrease in gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nVolatility and increases in the price of raw materials, energy and transportation, including due to climate change, could harm our profits.\nWe use many different raw materials for our business, particularly natural products, including essential oils, extracts and concentrates derived from fruits, vegetables, flowers, woods and other botanicals, animal products, raw fruits, organic chemicals and petroleum-based chemicals. We have experienced price volatility with respect to raw materials. For example, there has been industry-wide price volatility of certain ingredients used in fragrance compounds due to the BASF incident and in 2019 we experienced increases in the prices of certain naturals.\nNatural products represent approximately half of our raw material spend, and we expect such volatility to continue in the near future. In addition, because we offer a substantial number of natural product offerings and often rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain products, this risk may be exacerbated. There is growing evidence that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather and precipitation patterns, growing and harvesting conditions, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters, such as floods, wildfires, droughts and water scarcity. To the extent such climate change effects have a negative impact on crop size and quality, it could impact the availability and pricing of these natural products. If we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our products to offset raw material and other input cost increases, or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, we could fail to meet our cost expectations and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected. Increases in prices of our products to customers may lead to declines in sales volumes, and we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilarly, commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by, among other things, market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, production and transportation disruptions, climate change and weather conditions, and other world events. As we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control, if the cost of energy, shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers, our profit margins would be adversely affected. Furthermore, increasing our prices to our customers could result in long-term sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients, which could have an adverse long-term impact on our results of operations. Our ability to price our products competitively to timely reflect volatility in prices of raw material and ingredients is critical to maintain and grow our sales. To mitigate our sourcing risk, we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items. However, if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials or competitively price our products, our margins could be adversely affected.\nA significant data breach or other disruption to our information technology systems could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information or personal data, and adversely impact our reputation, business or results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems, including some managed by third-party providers, to conduct business and support our business processes, including those relating to product formulas, product development, manufacturing, sales, order and invoice processing, production, distribution, internal communications and communications with third parties throughout the world, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, tax or legal requirements, and collecting and storing customer, supplier, employee and other stakeholder information. Cyber security incidents, data breaches and operational disruptions caused by cyberattacks or cyber-intrusions are constantly evolving in nature, becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives,\nincluding computer hackers, foreign governments, cyber terrorists, cyber criminals and malicious employees or other insiders. We and our third-party providers are subject to risks posed by such incidents, which can take many forms, including code anomalies, \u201cActs of God,\u201d data leakage, hardware or software failures, human error, cyber extortion, password theft or introduction of viruses, malware, ransomware, including through phishing emails.\nA disruption to our information technology systems could result in the loss of confidential business, customer, supplier or employee information, litigation or fines and may require substantial investigations, repairs or replacements, or impact our ability to summarize and report financial results in a timely manner, resulting in significant financial, legal, and relational costs and potentially harming our reputation and adversely impacting our operations, customer service and results of operations. Because we do not currently have duplications of our information technology systems and we continue to work on upgrading and integrating Frutarom\u2019s systems into ours, these risks may be exacerbated. Additionally, a security or data breach could require us to devote significant management and financial resources to address the problems created. These types of adverse impacts could also occur in the event the confidentiality, integrity or availability of company, customer, supplier or employee information are compromised due to a data loss by us or a trusted third party. We or the third parties with which we share information may not discover any such incidents and loss of information for a significant period of time after the incident occurs. While we have security processes and initiatives in place, we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption in the future. Additionally, while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nIf we fail to comply with data protection laws in the U.S. and abroad, we may be subject to fines, penalties and other costs.\nRecently, there has also been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and abroad, and an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation (including, in some instances, class action litigation), fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. This regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs and enforcement risks. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of EU law and adds a broad array of requirements related to personal data, including individual notice and opt-out preferences and the public disclosure of significant data breaches. Additionally, violations of the GDPR can result in fines of as much as 4% of a company\u2019s annual revenue. Other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws, including data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. Beginning in 2020, we will also be required to comply with certain additional requirements under the California Consumer Privacy Act. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements, as well as the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of laws, impose significant costs and regulatory risks that are likely to increase over time. Our failure to comply with these evolving regulations could expose us to fines, penalties and other costs that could adversely impact our financial results.\nIf we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards, including those regarding product safety, quality, efficacy and environmental impact, we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are developed, manufactured and sold. In addition, we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by governments, industry or similar oversight bodies, or contractually by our customers, including requirements concerning product safety, quality and efficacy, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and waste management) and other sustainability or similar issues. We use a variety of strategies, methodologies and tools to minimize the likelihood of product or process non-compliance with these regulations and standards by (i) identifying current product standards, (ii) assessing relative risks in our supply chain, (iii) monitoring internal and external performance and (iv) testing raw materials and finished goods. As concerns regarding safety, quality and environmental impact become more pressing, we may see new, more restrictive regulations adopted that impact our products. For example, the European Chemicals Agency has proposed that the European Commission adopt a ban on microplastics, including those found in personal care items, detergents and cosmetics, to reduce plastics pollution. If this ban is adopted, we will be required to modify our products and/or innovate new solutions to replace microplastics in our products. If we are unable to adapt to these new regulations or standards in a cost effective and timely manner, we may lose business to competitors who are able to provide compliant products.\nGaps in our operational processes or those of our suppliers or distributors can result in products that do not meet our quality control or industry standards or fail to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements, which in turn can result in finished consumer goods that do not comply with applicable standards and requirements. Products that are mislabeled,\ncontaminated or damaged could result in a regulatory non-compliance event or even a product recall by the FDA or a similar foreign agency. Our contracts often require us to indemnify our customers for the costs associated with a product non-compliance event, including penalties, costs and settlements arising from litigation, remediation costs or loss of sales. As our flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients are used in many products intended for human use or consumption, these consequences would be exacerbated if we or our customer did not identify the defect before the product reaches the consumer and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level. Such a result could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity, negative effects on consumer\u2019s health, recalls and potential litigation, fines, penalties, sanctions or other regulatory actions. In addition, if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification from suppliers or other third parties, or if insurance or indemnification is not available, the liability relating to product or possible third-party claims arising from mislabeled, contaminated or damaged products could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, adverse publicity about our products, or our customers\u2019 products that contain our ingredients, including concerns about product safety or similar issues, whether real or perceived, could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales and customer relationships, as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation.\nIncreasing awareness of health and wellness are driving changes in the consumer products industry, and if we are unable to react in a timely and cost-effective manner, our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected.\nWe must continually anticipate and react, in a timely and cost-effective manner, to changes in consumer preferences and demands, including changes in demand driven by increasing awareness of health and wellness and demands for transparency or cleaner labels with respect to product ingredients by consumers and regulators. Consumers, especially in developed economies such as the U.S. and Western Europe, are rapidly shifting away from products containing artificial ingredients to all-natural, healthier alternatives. In addition, there has been a growing demand by consumers, non-governmental organizations and, to a lesser extent, governmental agencies to provide more transparency in product labeling and our customers have been taking steps to address this demand, including by voluntarily providing product-specific ingredients disclosure. These two trends could affect the types and volumes of our ingredients and compounds that our customers include in their consumer product offerings and, therefore, affect the demand for our products. If we are unable to react to or anticipate these trends in a timely and cost-effective manner, our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to increasing customer, consumer and regulatory focus on sustainability issues, which may result in additional costs in order to meet new requirements or upgrade Frutarom\u2019s sustainability practices\nFederal, state, local and foreign governments, our customers and consumers are becoming increasingly sensitive to sustainability issues. We have committed to a sustainability strategy designed to meet this global trend and are currently assessing our combined environmental footprint following the Frutarom acquisition, with the intent of identifying synergies, gaps and opportunities in our sustainability efforts.\nAs part of our assessment so far, we have begun upgrading Frutarom\u2019s sustainability practices to better align them to our legacy IFF practices, and which may require significant costs and time to implement. Our assessment may reveal additional gaps between the legacy Frutarom operations and our sustainability practices and goals, which may require significant costs to remedy.\nDespite our efforts, the increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations and customer requirements that could negatively affect us. These could cause us to incur additional direct costs or to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations and customer requirements. We could also lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements or if we are not successful in improving Frutarom\u2019s sustainability metrics. These potential costs, changes and loss of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have made investments in and continue to expand our business into emerging markets, which exposes us to certain risks.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have increased our presence in emerging markets by expanding our manufacturing presence, sales organization and product offerings in these markets, and we expect to continue to expand our business in these markets. With our acquisition of Frutarom in 2018, who also had a significant presence in emerging markets, our business in these markets has meaningfully grown. In addition to the currency and international risks described below, our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks. Emerging markets typically have a consumer base with limited or fluctuating disposable income and customer demand in these markets may fluctuate accordingly. As a result, decrease in customer demand in emerging markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth strategy.\nFurther, there is no assurance that our existing products, variants of our existing products or new products that we make, manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer preferences or otherwise. In addition, emerging markets may have weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights, exchange controls, unstable governments and privatization or other government actions that may affect taxes, subsidies and incentive programs and the flow of goods and currency. In conducting our business, we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country. Accordingly, we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in trade, customs and tax regimes in these markets. If we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets, our operating results and future growth could be adversely affected.\nThe impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate may negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe have significant operations outside the U.S., the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future. For example, as of July 1, 2018, we concluded that Argentina\u2019s economy is highly inflationary under US GAAP, as it has experienced cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. While our current operations in Argentina represent less than 3% of our consolidated net sales and less than 1% of our consolidated total assets, continuing inflation in Argentina could adversely affect our profitability in a specific period. Changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the recorded levels of sales, profitability, assets and/or liabilities. Additionally, volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows or liquidity. Although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities, we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations are subject to regulatory, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe operate on a global basis, with manufacturing and sales facilities in the U.S., Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Greater Asia. During 2019, 80% of our combined net sales were to customers outside the U.S. and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations. As a result, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by location, include the following:\n\u2022governmental laws, regulations and policies adopted to manage national economic and macroeconomic conditions, such as increases in taxes, austerity measures that may impact consumer spending, monetary policies that may impact inflation rates, employment regulations, currency fluctuations or controls and sustainability of resources;\n\u2022changes in environmental, health and safety regulations, such as the continued implementation of the European Union\u2019s REACH regulations and similar regulations that are being evaluated and adopted in other markets, and the burdens and costs of our compliance with such regulations which may differ significantly across jurisdictions;\n\u2022increased environmental, health and safety regulations or the loss of necessary environmental permits in certain countries;\n\u2022the imposition of or changes in customs, tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, and sanctions on trade with certain countries, imposed by the U.S. or other countries, which could adversely affect our cost or ability to import raw materials or export our flavors and fragrance products to surrounding markets;\n\u2022risks and costs arising from our ability to cater to local demand and customer preferences, language and cultural differences;\n\u2022changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in the countries in which we operate, including the risk of expropriation or nationalization, the costs and ability to repatriate the profit that we generate in these countries;\n\u2022risks and costs associated with complying with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws;\n\u2022risks and costs associated with political and economic instability, bribery and corruption, anti-American sentiment, and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained local personnel;\n\u2022natural disasters, global or local health crisis (such as the recent coronavirus outbreak), pandemics, epidemics or international conflicts, including terrorist acts, political crisis, national and regional labor strikes in the countries in which we operate, which could endanger our personnel, interrupt our operations or adversely affect the demand for our products, the results of certain regions or our global supply chain; or\n\u2022the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nEconomic uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products which may have a negative impact on our operating results and future growth.\nOur flavors and fragrance compounds and our fragrance, cosmetic active and functional food ingredients are components of a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world. Historically, demand for consumer products using these compounds and ingredients was stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and consumer needs, population growth, an expanding global middle-class and general economic growth, especially in emerging markets. The global economy has experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth. While some segments of the global economy appear to be recovering, the predictions surrounding the global recessionary economic environment in Europe has, and may in the near future, increase unemployment and underemployment, decrease salaries and wage rates, increase inflation or result in other market-wide cost pressures that will adversely affect demand for consumer products in both developed and emerging markets. In addition, growth rates in the emerging markets have moderated from previous levels. Reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our flavors and fragrances compounds or ingredients, or order cancellations. The timing of placing of orders and the amounts of these orders are generally at our customers\u2019 discretion. Customers may cancel, reduce or postpone orders with us on relatively short notice. Significant cancellations, reductions or delays in orders by customers could affect our quarterly results. It is currently anticipated that these challenging economic uncertainties will continue to affect certain of our markets during 2020 which could adversely affect our sales, profitability and overall operating results.\nFailure to comply with environmental protection laws may cause us to close, relocate or operate one or more of our plants at reduced production levels, and expose us to civil or criminal liability, which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth.\nOur business operations and properties procure, make use of, manufacture, sell, and distribute substances that are sometimes considered hazardous and are therefore subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment, including air emissions, sewage discharges, the use of hazardous materials, waste disposal practices and clean-up of existing environmental contamination. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us, including the need to close or relocate one or more of our production facilities, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, fines, sanctions, litigation, costly remediation measures, liability for damages and negative publicity. If we are unable to meet production requirements, we can lose customer orders, which can adversely affect our future growth or we may be required to make incremental capital investments to ensure supply. For example, we recently completed negotiations with the Chinese government concerning the relocation of a second Fragrance facility in China. Idling of facilities or production modifications has caused or may cause customers to seek alternate suppliers due to concerns regarding supply interruptions and these customers may not return or may order at reduced levels even once issues are remediated. If these non-compliance issues reoccur in China or occur or in any other jurisdiction, we may lose business and may be required to incur capital spending above previous expectations, close a plant, or operate a plant at significantly reduced production levels on a permanent basis, and our operating results and cash flows from operations may be adversely affected.\nOur performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory and/or working capital balances.\nWe evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life, expected sourcing levels, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our product/sales mix. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success, financial returns and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product/sales mix to meet our customers\u2019 demands, without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results. If our buying decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels, customer trends or our expectations about customer\nneeds are inaccurate, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or impairment charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory, which can adversely impact our financial results. Additionally, we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage. If we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage, our results of and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected.\nWe sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under \u201cfactoring\u201d agreements that are sponsored, solely and individually, by certain customers. The cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods. Should we choose not to participate, or if these programs were no longer available, it could reduce our cash flows from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar U.S. or foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe global nature of our business, the significance of our international revenue and our focus on emerging markets create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or for other commercial advantage. In addition, U.S. public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors, officers, employees, agents, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. As such, if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate or may pursue opportunities in some jurisdictions, such as China, India, Brazil, Russia and Africa, that pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues. In certain jurisdictions, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. From time to time, we have conducted and will conduct internal investigations of the relevant facts and circumstances, control testing and compliance reviews, and take remedial actions, when appropriate, to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable corruption and similar laws and regulations. For example, in August 2019, during the integration of Frutarom, we were made aware of allegations that two Frutarom businesses operating principally in Russia and Ukraine made certain improper payments, including to representatives of a number of customers. Our investigation substantiated the allegations that improper payments to representatives of customers were made and that key members of Frutarom\u2019s senior management at the time were aware of such payments. We did not uncover any evidence suggesting that such payments had any connection to the U.S. In addition, Frutarom grew through rapid acquisition and, as part of our integration efforts, we are implementing our anti- corruption and similar policies throughout a number of those acquired companies, many of which were not previously subject to these U.S. laws.\nDetecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the FCPA or other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations is expensive, could consume significant time and attention of our senior management and could subject us to investigations and inquiries by governmental and other regulatory bodies. Any allegations of non- compliance with such laws and regulations could have a disruptive effect on our operations in such jurisdiction, including interruptions of business or loss of third-party relationships, which may negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with such laws and regulations could expose us to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, significant fines, termination of necessary\nlicenses and permits, and penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation.\nAny impairment of our tangible or intangible long-lived assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our profitability.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of long-lived assets, including tangible assets such as our manufacturing facilities, and intangible assets, including goodwill. As a result of numerous recent acquisitions, including the 2018 acquisition of Frutarom, as of December 31, 2019, we had recorded approximately $8.3 billion of intangible assets and goodwill, including $4.3 billion of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Frutarom. Our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets or goodwill occur.\nAt least annually, we assess both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. We test for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit\nexceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment charge based on the difference of the two. Intangible assets with finite lives are also tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events and changes in circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections (for example due to regulatory or industry changes), our inability to recognize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural disaster or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), acts by governments and courts, operating results falling short of projections, or significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our business performance, future plans, future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth rates, and based on industry, economic, regulatory conditions and other market factors. To the extent any of our acquisitions, including the acquisition of Frutarom, do not perform as anticipated and our underlying assumptions and estimates related to their fair value determination are not met, whether due to internal or external factors, the value of such assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights. We often rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations, as well as our extract methodologies, and processes for our nutrition, natural colors for food and natural antioxidants for food protection, as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property. From time to time, a third party may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their intellectual property rights, or a third party may infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. We could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights against third parties or to defend ourselves from third-party assertions of invalidity, infringement, misappropriation or other claims. Any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights. Any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. For those intellectual property rights that are protected as trade secrets, this litigation could result in even higher costs, and potentially the loss of certain rights, since we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making, using or selling our products or processes. The ongoing trend among our customers towards more transparent labeling could further diminish our ability to effectively protect our proprietary flavor formulations.\nFor intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents, we cannot be certain that these rights, if obtained, will not later be opposed, invalidated, or circumvented. In addition, even if such rights are obtained in the U.S., the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the US. If other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights, or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights, it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by, among other things, (i) reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights, (ii) increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights, (iii) limiting the volume, if any, of such products that we can sell or (iv) resulting in significant litigation costs and potential liability.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation.\nFrom time to time we are involved in a number of legal claims, regulatory investigations and litigation, including claims related to intellectual property, product liability, environmental matters and indirect taxes. For instance, product liability claims may arise due to the fact that we supply flavors and fragrances to the food and beverage, functional food, pharma/nutraceutical and personal care industries. Our manufacturing and other facilities may expose us to environmental claims and regulatory investigations. In addition, as we expand our product offering into functional food, nutraceuticals, and natural antioxidants, we may also be subject to claims of false or deceptive advertising claims in the U.S., Europe and other foreign jurisdictions in which we offer these types of products. These claims can arise as a result of function claims, health claims, nutrient content claims and other claims that impermissibly suggest therapeutic benefits for certain foods or food components. The cost of defending these claims or our obligations for direct damages and indemnification if we were found liable could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs a result of the acquisition of Frutarom, we assumed a number of legal claims, regulatory investigations and litigation and we may become involved in additional actions in the future arising from the acquired operations. Specifically, as Frutarom has a significantly greater number of facilities that are located globally and a significantly larger number of customers, our\nexposure to these types of environmental claims, product liability claims and regulatory investigations may increase. This could result in an increase in our cost for defense or settlement of claims or indemnification obligations if we were to be found liable in excess of our historical experience.\nIn addition, we are also the subject of a putative shareholder class action lawsuit filed in August 2019 after we disclosed that preliminary results of investigations indicated that Frutarom businesses operating principally in Russia and Ukraine had made improper payments to representatives of customers.\nOur insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims and our current levels of insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices. Any of these factors could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nOur funding obligations for our pension and postretirement plans could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\nThe funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets and interest rates. Funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations, we could be required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can be very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. An adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity.\nAssumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors. In the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on assets, or expected health care costs, our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements.\nChanges in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or changes in existing tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions, cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries. These transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management and compliance of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results. Many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction, challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential non-compliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where non-compliance is determined. However, governmental authorities could challenge these policies more aggressively in the future and, if challenged, we may not prevail. We could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing policies.\nWe are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate, and we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the countries in which we operate. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals, and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made.\nIn addition, a number of international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and begun investigations of the tax practices of multi-national companies and, in the European Union, the tax policies of certain European Union member states. One of these efforts has been led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international association of 34 countries including the U.S., which has finalized recommendations to revise corporate tax, transfer pricing, and tax treaty provisions in member countries. Since 2013, the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) has been investigating tax rulings granted by tax authorities in a number of European Union member states with respect to specific\nmulti-national corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with European Union rules on state aid, as well as more recent investigations of the tax regimes of certain European Union member states. Under European Union law, selective tax advantages for particular taxpayers that are not sufficiently grounded in economic realities may constitute impermissible state aid. If the EC determines that a tax ruling or tax regime violates the state aid restrictions, the tax authorities of the affected European Union member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling. In late 2015 and early 2016, the EC declared that tax rulings, related to other companies, by tax authorities in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium did not comply with the European Union state aid restrictions. If the EC or tax authorities in other jurisdictions were to successfully challenge tax rulings applicable to us in any of the member states in which we are subject to taxation or our internal intercompany arrangements, we could be exposed to increased tax liabilities.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) that significantly revised the U.S. tax code effective January 1, 2018 by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat 21%, limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation, transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations. The Tax Act impacted our consolidated results of operations during 2019 and is expected to continue to impact our consolidated results of operations in future periods. In future periods, we expect that our effective tax rate will be impacted by the lower U.S. corporate tax rate that will initially be offset by the elimination of the deductibility of performance-based incentive compensation, and other provisions of the Tax Act that may impact us prospectively. However, the ultimate impact of the Tax Act will depend on additional regulatory or accounting guidance that may be issued with respect to the Tax Act and any operating and structural changes that we may undertake to permit us to benefit from the new, lower U.S. tax rate prospectively. This could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business may be negatively impacted as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union.\nWe currently manufacture goods in the United Kingdom for distribution in the European Union and vice-versa and therefore may be adversely affected as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) in 2020. The impact of the withdrawal could, among other outcomes, exacerbate the disruption of the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union, undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union or other nations as the United Kingdom pursues independent trade relations. In addition, Brexit has caused legal uncertainty, which could last indefinitely, and may potentially create divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what the financial, trade and legal implications of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will be and how the withdrawal will affect us. Adverse consequences concerning Brexit or the European Union could include deterioration in global economic conditions, instability in global financial markets, political uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, or adverse changes in the cross-border agreements currently in place, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future.\nThe expected phase out of the London Interbank Office Rate (LIBOR) could impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and cause our interest expense to increase.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Currently there is no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan are at variable interest rates based on LIBOR. If LIBOR is no longer available, or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may need to amend our debt facilities to replace LIBOR with an agreed upon replacement index, which could result in higher rates and adversely impact our interest expense\nRisks Relating to Our Pending Combination with Nutrition and Biosciences, Inc. (\u201cN&B\u201d)\nAs previously announced, on December 15, 2019, we entered into, among other agreements, an agreement and plan of merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with DuPont, pursuant to which, subject to closing conditions customary for a transaction of this type, we will combine with DuPont\u2019s nutrition and biosciences business (the \u201cN&B Business\u201d). Upon completion of our combination with the N&B Business (the \u201cN&B Transaction\u201d), DuPont shareholders will own approximately 55.4% of the shares of IFF, and existing IFF shareholders will own approximately 44.6% of the shares of IFF. A proxy statement/prospectus on Form S-4 is expected to be filed with the SEC pursuant to which IFF shareholders will be asked to approve the share issuance required to effect the N&B Transaction.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the N&B Transaction is pending that may have a negative impact on our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the pending N&B Transaction may have a negative impact on our business, including relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees. These uncertainties may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause customers and others that deal with us to defer or decline entering into contracts with us or making other decisions concerning us or seek to change existing business relationships with us. In addition, if key employees depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential complexities of the transaction, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, the Merger Agreement contains restrictions on our ability to take certain actions outside the ordinary course of business prior to the closing of the transaction, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking certain actions or business opportunities that may arise prior to the closing. For more information, see the Merger Agreement incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have incurred, and will incur, substantial direct and indirect costs as well as additional debt as a result of the N&B Transaction.\nWe have incurred, and will incur, substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of completing the N&B Transaction, including financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses, regulatory filings and filing and printing fees, as well as additional debt, thereby significantly increasing our leverage. Our leverage and required payments may adversely affect our credit rating, cash flows, operating results or our ability to return capital to our shareholders and the additional debt instruments may subject us to additional covenants.\nIn addition, over a period of time following the closing, we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with transitioning, integrating and coordinating the businesses, operations, policies and procedures of us and the N&B Business. A portion of the transaction costs related to the transaction will be incurred regardless of whether the transaction is completed. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations prior to the transaction and of the combined businesses following the transaction.\nThe Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the N&B Transaction.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to enter into alternative transactions and provisions that restrict our ability to, among other things, solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal from a third party. While we believe these provisions are reasonable and customary for transactions of this type, the provisions might discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing such acquisition, even if such party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per-share value than the currently proposed transaction consideration.\nThe requirement to obtain governmental approvals to satisfy the conditions to the completion of the N&B Transaction may delay or prevent completion of the transaction.\nThe completion of the N&B Transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental authorizations, consents, orders or other approvals, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. IFF and DuPont intend to pursue all required approvals in accordance with the Merger Agreement. These approvals may impose conditions on or require divestitures relating to the operations or assets of IFF or the N&B Business, and such conditions or divestitures may jeopardize or delay the completion of the transaction or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction. Further, no assurance can be given that the required approvals will be obtained and, even if all such approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or whether they will satisfy the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nIf we fail to complete the N&B Transaction, our business, financial results and stock price could be negatively impacted.\nThe closing of the N&B Transaction is subject to numerous conditions. If the N&B Transaction is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks and consequences, including the following:\n\u2022we may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay a termination fee of $521.5 million or to reimburse DuPont\u2019s transaction-related expenses in an amount up to $75 million;\n\u2022we will be required to pay certain costs relating to the transaction, whether or not the transaction is completed, such as significant fees and expenses relating to financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses, regulatory filings and filing and printing fees; and\n\u2022matters relating to the transaction may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses, which could otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us.\nIn addition, if the N&B Transaction is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our employees, clients and customers. We could also be subject to litigation, including litigation related to failure to complete the transaction or to enforce our obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the N&B Transaction is not consummated, there can be no assurance that the risks described above will not materially affect our business, financial results and stock price.\nThe integration of the N&B Business with IFF may present significant challenges, and we may not realize anticipated synergies and other benefits of the N&B Transaction.\nThe combination of independent businesses is complex, costly and time-consuming, and combining our and the N&B Business\u2019 practices and operations may divert significant management attention and resources and disrupt our business. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our business activities and could adversely affect our results of operations. The overall combination of our business and the N&B Business may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and loss of customer and other business relationships. The difficulties of integration include, among others:\n\u2022the diversion of management attention to integration matters;\n\u2022integrating operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems, some of which may prove to be incompatible;\n\u2022conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the businesses;\n\u2022integrating employees and attracting and retaining key personnel, including talent;\n\u2022retaining existing, and obtaining new customers and suppliers;\n\u2022managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;\n\u2022contingent liabilities that are larger than expected; and\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the transaction.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and/or will be outside the control of the N&B Business, and any one of them could result in lower revenues, higher costs and diversion of management time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of our business.\nIn addition, even if the operations of our business and the N&B Business are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the transaction may not be realized, including, among others, the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our business and the N&B Business. All of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of IFF, decrease or delay the projected accretive effect of the transaction, and negatively impact the price of IFF common stock following the transaction.\nCurrent IFF shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership interest in IFF will be substantially diluted in the N&B Transaction.\nThe IFF common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis immediately prior to the N&B Transaction will represent, in the aggregate, approximately 44.6% of IFF common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis immediately following the transaction. Consequently, IFF\u2019s pre-transaction equity holders, as a group, will be substantially diluted in the transaction and have less ability to exercise influence over the management and policies of IFF following the transaction.", "PERMNO": 40272, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "IFF"}
