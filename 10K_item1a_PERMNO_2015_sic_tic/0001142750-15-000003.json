{"cik": "1142750", "company": "AMN HEALTHCARE SERVICES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully read the following risk factors in connection with evaluating us and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business or our consolidated operating results, financial condition and cash flows, which, in turn, could cause the price of our common stock to decline. The risk factors described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Factors we currently do not know, factors that we currently consider immaterial or factors that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions, may also materially adversely affect our business or our consolidated operating results, financial\ncondition or cash flows. The risk factors described below qualify all forward-looking statements we make, including forward-looking statements within this section entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nRisk Factors that May Affect the Demand for Our Services\nEconomic downturns and slow recoveries could result in less demand from clients or otherwise negatively affect our clients, either of which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for staffing services is sensitive to changes in economic activity. As economic activity slows, hospitals and other healthcare entities typically experience decreased attrition and reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their regular employees, which results in decreased demand for our services. In times of economic downturn and high unemployment rates, permanent full time and part time healthcare facility staff are generally inclined to work more hours and overtime, resulting in fewer available vacancies and less demand for our services. Fewer placement opportunities for our temporary clinicians and physicians also impair our ability to recruit and place them both on a temporary and permanent basis.\nMany healthcare facilities utilize temporary healthcare professionals to accommodate an increase in hospital admissions. Alternatively, when hospital admissions decrease, due to reduced consumer spending, general unemployment causing an increase in under- and uninsured patients and other factors, the demand for our temporary healthcare professionals typically declines. This may have an even greater negative impact on demand for physicians in certain specialties such as surgery, radiology and anesthesiology. In addition, we may experience more competitive pricing pressure during periods of decreased patient occupancy and hospital admissions, negatively affecting our revenue and profitability.\nDuring challenging economic times, our clients, in particular our clients that rely on state government funding, may face issues gaining access to sufficient credit, which could result in an impairment of their ability to make payments to us, timely or otherwise, for services rendered. If that were to occur, we may increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding would be negatively affected.\nOur business depends upon our ability to maintain existing and secure new contracts directly with our clients and through group purchasing organizations.\nOutside of our managed services and VMS offerings, our hospital, healthcare facility and physician practice group clients are generally free to award contracts to and place orders and new searches with our competitors. Our clients may purchase these services directly or through group purchasing organizations with whom we must establish relationships in order to continue to provide our staffing services to our healthcare facility clients.\nIn addition, we provide services to some of our government clients through businesses such as small businesses or minority-owned contractors who have received set-aside awards. These intermediary organizations may negatively affect our ability to obtain new clients and maintain our existing client relationships by impeding our ability to access and contract directly with clients and may also negatively affect the profitability of these client relationships.\nConsolidation and concentration in buyers of healthcare workforce solutions and staffing services could negatively affect pricing of our services and our ability to mitigate credit risk.\nWe extend credit and payment terms to our clients. In addition to ongoing credit evaluations of our clients\u2019 financial condition, we traditionally seek to mitigate our credit risk by managing client concentration. We have seen an increase in our clients\u2019 use of intermediaries such as vendor management service companies and group purchasing organizations as well as consolidation of healthcare systems, which may provide these organizations enhanced bargaining power. At the same time, our own success in winning managed services contracts means some larger health systems have grown and may continue to grow substantially relative to our other revenue sources. These dynamics could lead to a greater concentration of buyers of healthcare staffing services and less diversification of our customer base, which could negatively affect pricing for our services and our ability to mitigate credit risk.\nOne of our clients within our nurse and allied healthcare staffing segment comprised approximately 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2014. If we were to lose that client and were unable to provide a significant amount of services to that client, whether directly or as a subcontractor, such loss may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to anticipate and quickly respond to changing marketplace conditions, such as alternative modes of healthcare delivery, reimbursement and client needs, we may not remain competitive.\nThe settings for the delivery of patient services continually evolve and implicate alternative modes of healthcare delivery, such as telemedicine. Government mandates, third-party reimbursements and the public\u2019s adoption and demand for such new modes of healthcare delivery may negatively affect our clients\u2019 demand for our services, which, in turn, could negatively affect our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop innovative workforce solutions and quickly adapt to changing marketplace conditions and client needs. The success of new service lines and business models will depend on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy client needs, quickly come into compliance with new federal or state regulations, and differentiate our services and abilities from those of our competitors. Moreover, our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging client needs and marketplace conditions. The development of these service lines and business models requires close attention to emerging trends and proposed federal and state legislation related to the healthcare industry. If we are unable to anticipate changing marketplace conditions, adapt our current business model to adequately meet changing conditions in the healthcare industry and develop and successfully implement innovative services, we may not remain competitive.\nThe ability of our clients to retain and increase the productivity of their permanent staff or their ability to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their internal recruiting efforts, through online recruiting or otherwise, may affect the demand for our services, which could negatively affect our revenue, results of operation and cash flows.\nIf our clients retain and increase the productivity of their permanent clinical staff, their need for our recruitment and placement services for temporary positions may decline. Higher permanent staff retention rates and increased productivity of permanent staff members could result in increased efficiencies, thereby reducing the demand for both our recruitment and placement services for temporary positions, which could negatively affect our revenue, results of operation and cash flows. Additionally, many of our clients maintain internal recruitment functions of various degrees of sophistication for their staffing needs, including utilization of online recruitment technologies. If such clients are able to successfully increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their internal recruiting efforts, through more effective internet- or social media-based recruiting or otherwise, it could reduce the demand for our permanent and temporary staffing services, which could negatively affect our revenue, results of operation and cash flows.\nRegulatory and Legal Risk Factors\nWe are subject to federal and state healthcare industry regulation including conduct of operations, and costs and payment for services and payment for referrals as well as laws regarding employment practices and government contracting.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations related to conduct of operations, costs and payment for services and payment for referrals. We provide workforce solutions and services on a contract basis to our clients, who pay us directly. Accordingly, Medicare, Medicaid and insurance reimbursement policy changes generally do not directly impact us. Nevertheless, reimbursement changes in government programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid, can and do indirectly affect the demand and the prices paid for our services. For example, our clients could receive reduced or no reimbursements because of a change in the rates or conditions set by federal or state governments, which would negatively affect the demand and the prices for our services. In addition, our hospital, healthcare facility and physician practice group clients could suffer civil and criminal penalties, and be excluded from participating in Medicare, Medicaid and other healthcare programs for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, which may negatively affect our profitability.\nA significant portion of our hospital and healthcare facility clients are state and federal government agencies, where our ability to compete for new contracts and orders, and the profitability of these contracts and orders, may be affected by government legislation, regulation or policy. Additionally, in providing services to state and federal government clients and to clients who participate in state and federal programs, we are also subject to specific laws and regulations, which government agencies have broad latitude to enforce. If we were to be excluded from participation in these programs or should there be regulatory or policy changes or modification of application of existing regulations, it would likely materially adversely affect our business and our consolidated operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to quickly and efficiently assist in obtaining licenses and privileges for our healthcare professionals. The costs to provide these credentialing services impact the revenue and profitability of our business.\nWe are also subject to certain laws and regulations applicable to recruitment and placement agencies. Like all employers, we must also comply with various laws and regulations relating to employment and pay practices. There is a risk that we could be subject to payment of additional wages, insurance and employment and payroll-related taxes. Because of the nature of our business, the impact of these employment and payroll laws and regulations may have a more pronounced effect on our business. These laws and regulations may also impede our ability to grow the size and profitability of our operations.\nLegislation regarding the current delivery and third-party payor system for healthcare may have significant and unforeseeable effects on our business.\nThe PPACA was signed into law on March 23, 2010. The PPACA was subsequently amended on March 30, 2010 by the Reconciliation Act. The PPACA and Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \u201cAct\u201d) entail sweeping health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 through 2018, and many provisions in the Act require the issuance of additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor, the IRS, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, and the states. As the various provisions of the Act are implemented, the insurance market place and how employers provide insurance to employees is changing causing uncertainty for our clients and us. In addition, the shifting political landscape and commentary surrounding the Act provide increased uncertainty and the way in which the PPACA is ultimately implemented may have unforeseen effects on our clients and us.\nThe challenge to the classification of certain of our healthcare professionals as independent contractors could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe treat physicians and certain advanced practitioners, such as certified nurse anesthetists, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, as independent contractors. Federal or state taxing authorities may take the position that such professionals are employees exposing us to additional wage and insurance claims, and employment and payroll-related taxes. A reclassification of our locum tenens clinicians and physicians to employees from independent contractors could result in liability that would have a significant negative impact on the profitability of the period in which assessed, and would require changes to our payroll and related business processes, which could be costly. In addition, many states have laws that prohibit non-physician owned companies from employing physicians, referred to as the \u201ccorporate practice of medicine.\u201d If our independent contractor physicians were classified as employees in states that prohibit the corporate practice of medicine, we may be prohibited from conducting our locum tenens staffing business in those states under our current business model, which may have a substantial negative effect on our revenue, results of operations and profitability.\nMedical malpractice, violation of employment and wage regulations and other claims asserted against us could subject us to substantial liabilities.\nWe, along with our clients and healthcare professionals, are subject to investigations, claims and legal actions alleging malpractice or related legal theories. At times, plaintiffs name us in these lawsuits and actions regardless of our contractual obligations, the competency of the healthcare professionals, the standard of care provided by the healthcare professionals, the quality of service that we provided or our actions. In certain instances, we are contractually required to indemnify our clients against some or all of these potential legal actions. Additionally, we may be subject to various employment claims, including wage and hour claims, by our corporate employees and our employed healthcare professionals. We are also subject to possible claims alleging discrimination, sexual harassment and other similar activities in which we or our hospital and healthcare facility clients and their agents have allegedly engaged.\nThe nature of our business requires us to place our personnel in the workplaces of other businesses. Many of these individuals have access to client proprietary information systems and confidential information. An inherent risk of such activity includes possible claims of intentional misconduct, release, misuse or misappropriation of client intellectual property, confidential information, funds, or other property, cybersecurity breaches affecting our clients or us, criminal activity, torts or other claims. Such claims may result in negative publicity, injunctive relief, criminal investigations or charges, civil litigation, payment by us of monetary damages or fines, or other material adverse effects on our business.\nWe maintain various types of insurance coverage, including professional liability and employment practices, through commercial insurance carriers and a wholly-owned captive insurance company, and we self-insure for many of these types of claims through accruals for retention reserves. However, the cost of defending such claims, even if groundless, could be substantial and the associated negative publicity could adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and place qualified employees and healthcare professionals in the future. We may also experience increased insurance costs and reserve accruals and may not be able to pass on all or any portion of increased insurance costs to our clients, thereby reducing our profitability. Moreover, our insurance coverage and reserve accruals may not be sufficient to cover all claims against us.\nWe are also subject to exam from various federal and state taxation authorities from time to time and an unforeseen negative outcome from such an exam could have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur inability to safely secure private information could subject us to substantial liabilities.\nWe collect, retain and have access to personal information, personal health information and other protected information. The collection, use and maintenance of personal and health information is subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations. We use software systems, security controls and business controls to limit access to the information and the inadvertent release of the information. However, private information may be accessed or released intentionally or unintentionally, resulting in a breach of privacy. A breach in privacy may require notifications and system changes and also subject us to certain fines, sanctions and legal actions, any or all of which may be costly. In addition, such a breach may cause reputational damage that could significantly impair our relationship with our clients and healthcare professionals.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Operations, Personnel and Information Systems\nOur inability to implement new infrastructure and technology systems may adversely affect our operating results and ability to manage our business effectively.\nWe have technology, operations and human capital infrastructures to support our existing business. We must continue to invest in these infrastructures including implementing new operating and front and back office technology systems to support our growth and improve our efficiency, and we have embarked on a multi-year plan to upgrade and convert our infrastructure, back office and front office network platforms. Implementing new systems is costly and involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new technology platform, including loss of information, disruption to our normal operations, changes in accounting procedures and internal control over financial reporting, as well as problems achieving accuracy in the conversion of electronic data. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could result in increased costs, the diversion of management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention and resources and could materially adversely affect our operating results, internal controls over financial reporting and ability to manage our business effectively.\nTechnology disruptions and obsolescence may negatively affect our business operations.\nOur ability to deliver services to our clients and to manage our internal systems depends largely upon our access to and the performance of our management information and communications systems, including our VMS and other client/healthcare professional-facing self-service websites. These technology systems also maintain accounting and financial information upon which we depend to fulfill our financial reporting obligations. Although we have risk mitigation measures, these systems, and our access to these systems, are not impervious to floods, fire, storms, or other natural disasters, or service interruptions. There also is a potential for intentional and deliberate attacks to our systems, which may lead to service interruptions, data corruption or data theft. Additionally, these systems are subject to other non-environmental risks, including technological obsolescence and lack of strategic alignment with our evolving business. We have embarked on a multi-year plan to update and align our technology with our current and future business needs. If our current or planned systems do not adequately support our operations, are damaged or disrupted or if we are unable to replace, repair, maintain or expand them, it may adversely affect our business operations and our profitability.\nIf we do not continue to recruit and retain sufficient quality healthcare professionals at reasonable costs, it could increase our operating costs and negatively affect our business and our profitability.\nWe rely significantly on our ability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of healthcare professionals who possess the skills, experience and licenses necessary to meet the requirements of our clients. We compete with healthcare staffing companies, recruitment and placement agencies, including online staffing and recruitment agencies, and with hospitals, healthcare facilities and physician practice groups to attract healthcare professionals based on the quantity, diversity and quality of assignments offered, compensation packages and the benefits that we provide. We rely on our human capital intensive, relationship-oriented approach and national infrastructure to enable us to compete in all aspects of our business, but particularly in the physician permanent placement business. We must continually evaluate and expand our temporary and permanent healthcare professional network to serve the needs of our clients.\nOur ability to recruit and retain temporary and permanent healthcare professionals depends on several factors, including our ability to provide our healthcare professionals with assignments and placements that they view as attractive and to provide competitive compensation packages. The costs of attracting healthcare professionals and providing them with attractive compensation packages may be higher than we anticipate, or we may be unable to pass these costs on to our hospital and\nhealthcare facility clients, which may reduce our profitability. Moreover, if we are unable to recruit temporary and permanent healthcare professionals, our service execution may deteriorate and, as a result, we could lose clients.\nThe inability to properly screen and match quality healthcare professionals with suitable placements may negatively affect demand for our services.\nOur success depends on the quality of our healthcare professionals. A quality or licensure issue could adversely affect our business, client demand for our services, and potential for growth. Our ability to ensure the quality of our healthcare professionals relies heavily on the effectiveness of our data and communication systems as well as properly trained and competent operational employees that screen and match healthcare professionals in suitable placements. An inability to properly screen, match, and monitor healthcare professionals for acceptable credentials, experience, and performance may cause clients to lose confidence in our services, which may damage our reputation and result in clients opting to utilize competitors\u2019 services or rely on their own internal resources.\nOur operations may deteriorate if we are unable to continue to attract, develop and retain our sales and operations team members.\nOur success depends heavily upon the performance of our sales and operations team members. The number of individuals who meet our qualifications for these positions is limited, and we may experience difficulty in attracting qualified candidates. In addition, we commit substantial resources to the training, development and support of our team members. Competition for qualified sales team members in the line of business in which we operate is strong, and we may not be able to retain some of our sales team members after we have expended the time and expense to recruit and train them.\nThe loss of key officers and management personnel could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe believe that the success of our business strategy and our ability to maintain our recent levels of profitability depends on the continued employment of our senior management team. We have an employment agreement with Susan R. Salka, our President and Chief Executive Officer, through May 4, 2016, which is renewable on an annual basis. Other senior members of the team are employees at will with standard severance agreements. If members of our senior management team become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur inability to maintain our positive brand awareness and identity may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have invested substantial amounts in acquiring, developing and maintaining our brands, and our success depends substantially on our ability to maintain positive brand awareness identities for existing services and effectively building up brand awareness and image for new services. We cannot assure that additional expenditures and our continuing commitment to marketing and improving our brands will have the desired effect on our brands\u2019 value, which may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our brands may suffer reputational damage that could negatively affect our short- and long-term financial results.\nOur inability to effectively incorporate acquisitions into our business operations may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe invest time and resources in carefully assessing opportunities for acquisitions, and made acquisitions in 2013, 2014 and early 2015 to broaden the scope and depth of our workforce solutions and bolster our staffing services. Despite diligence and integration planning, acquisitions still present certain risks, including the time and economic costs of integrating an acquisition\u2019s technology, control and financial systems, unforeseen liabilities, and the difficulties in bringing together different work cultures and personnel. Difficulties in integrating our acquisitions may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe maintain a substantial amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles on our balance sheet that may decrease our earnings or increase our losses if we recognize an impairment to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles.\nWe maintain goodwill on our balance sheet, which represents the excess of the total purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets and indefinite-lived intangibles we acquired. We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. If we identify an impairment, we record a charge to earnings. An impairment charge to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles would decrease our earnings or increase our losses, as the case may be, which may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Indebtedness and Other Liabilities\nWe have substantial tax and insurance-related accruals on our balance sheet, and any significant adverse adjustments in these accruals may decrease our earnings or increase our losses and negatively impact our cash flow.\nWe maintain accruals related to our captive insurance company for professional liability and employment practices, and self-insured retention accruals for our health insurance, workers compensation and employment practices related matters on our balance sheet. A significant increase to these accruals may decrease our earnings. We determine the adequacy of our accruals by evaluating our historical experience and trends, related to both insurance claims and payments, information provided to us by our insurance brokers, attorneys, third-party administrators, actuarial firms and tax advisors as well as industry experience and trends. If such information collectively indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated, we reduce or provide for additional accruals, as appropriate.\nIn addition, we maintain an unrecognized tax benefits accrual related to certain income tax positions that we have taken. As of December 31, 2014, the unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties was $28.7 million. Adjustments in the amount or nature of accruals for tax matters may negatively impact our financial results and our cash flow, if there are payments to governmental agencies associated with these tax positions.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our future financial condition.\nWe are party to a credit agreement, which contains various financial covenants, restricts the payment of dividends, and limits the amount of repurchases of our common stock. As of December 31, 2014, our total debt outstanding equaled $162.4 million.\nOur indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition by, among other things:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or to increases in interest rates, particularly with respect to the portion of our outstanding debt that is subject to variable interest rates;\n\u2022\npotentially limiting our ability to obtain additional financing or to obtain such financing on favorable terms;\n\u2022\ncausing us to dedicate a portion of future cash flow from operations to service or pay down our debt, which reduces the cash available for other purposes, such as operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; and\n\u2022\npossibly limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less leveraged.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. Additionally, if we are not in compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement, we would be in default, and the lenders could call the debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 89215, "SIC": 7361, "TIC": "AMN"}
