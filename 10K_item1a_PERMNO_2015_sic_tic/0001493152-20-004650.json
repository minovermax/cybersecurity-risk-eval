{"cik": "1321834", "company": "Akers Biosciences, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities is speculative involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our securities, you should consider carefully the risks described below, together with other information in this Annual Report and the other information and documents we file with the SEC. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects, as well as our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisition\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Cystron and those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nOn March 23, 2020, we entered into the MIPA with the Sellers, pursuant to which we will acquire the Membership Interests of Cystron. Cystron is a party to the Initial License Agreement with Premas. As a condition to the Company\u2019s entry into the MIPA, Cystron amended and restated the Initial License Agreement on March 19, 2020 (as amended and restated, the \u201cLicense Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the License Agreement, Premas granted Cystron, amongst other things, an exclusive license with respect to Premas\u2019 vaccine platform for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine or combination product by the Company (the \u201cCOVID-19 Vaccine\u201d). Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to produce a vaccine that successfully treats coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d). The development of the COVID-19 Vaccine is in very early stages and there is no assurance that we will be able to produce an effective vaccine. The failure to produce the COVID-19 Vaccine could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we expect to incur significant expenses related to the acquisition. These expenses include, but are not limited to, the Common Stock Consideration, a cash consideration of $1.0 million, related contingent fees, legal fees and other related fees and expenses. Many of these expenses will be payable by us regardless of our ability to successfully develop the COVID-19 Vaccine, and we will not be able to recover these expenses in the event that we fail to develop the COVID-19 Vaccine.\nOur acquisition of Cystron could result in additional costs, integration or operating difficulties, dilution and other adverse consequences.\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Cystron and in pursuit of developing the COVID-19 Vaccine, we may:\n\u25cf issue equity securities that may substantially dilute our stockholders\u2019 percentage of ownership;\n\u25cf be obligated to make milestone, royalty or other contingent or non-contingent payments; and\n\u25cf incur debt or non-recurring and other charges, or assume liabilities.\nIn addition, the process of integrating Cystron may create operating difficulties and expenditures and pose numerous additional risks to our operations, including:\n\u25cf failure to develop, manufacture or supply the COVID-19 Vaccine economically or successfully commercialize or achieve market acceptance of the COVID-19 Vaccine;\n\u25cf exposure to liabilities of Cystron, including known or unknown risks relating to the validity or enforceability of exclusivity rights and generic competition;\n\u25cf adverse effects on our operating results or financial condition, including due to expenditures or acquisition-related costs, costs of commercialization or amortization or impairment costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u25cf impairment of relationships with key suppliers and manufacturers due to changes in management and ownership and difficulty in maintaining existing agreements, licenses and other arrangements or rights on substantially similar terms as existed prior to the acquisition;\n\u25cf regulatory changes and market dynamics after the acquisition; and\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired entity.\nIf any of the above events (or more) occur, or if we cannot effectively manage or respond to such events following the acquisition, they may have material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCystron is dependent on technologies that is has licensed, and Cystron may need to license in the future, and if Cystron fails to obtain licenses it needs, or fails to comply with its payment obligations in the agreements under which Cystron in-license intellectual property and other rights from third parties, Cystron could lose its ability to develop a COVID-19.\nCystron currently is dependent on a license from Premas for its key technologies. Any failure to make the payments required by the license agreement may permit Premas to terminate the license. If Cystron were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain the license for any reason, it would halt Cystron\u2019s ability to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. The foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nIn addition, Cystron does not own the patents or patent applications that it licenses, and as such, Cystron may need to rely upon Premas to properly prosecute and maintain those patent applications and prevent infringement of those patents. If Premas is unable to adequately protect their proprietary intellectual property Cystron licenses from legal challenges, or Cystron is unable to enforce such licensed intellectual property against infringement or alternative technologies, we will not be able to compete effectively in the drug discovery and development business.\nCystron will face intense competition.\nWe believe that many other pharmaceutical and biotechnologies are working on vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. Some of them are large, multi-national pharmaceutical companies with significantly greater resources than Cystron. If one of these other companies develops an effective vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 before Cystron, then even if Cystron successfully develops a vaccine it may never gain market acceptance.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses and we cannot guarantee that we can ever achieve sustained profitability.\nWe have recorded a net loss attributable to common stockholders in most reporting periods since our inception. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $3,888,249 and $10,849,034, respectively. Our accumulated deficit at December 31, 2019 was $119,583,130. Our strategy for the medical device business is to leverage where possible our distributor relationships, while exploring strategies for further reducing our costs. Overall, we are working to reduce our cash burn in order to have sufficient cash funds available to execute on a transaction which would result from our pursuit of strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance of success in reducing our loss, becoming profitable, or having sufficient cash to complete a strategic alternative transaction.\nOur pursuit of the COVID-19 Vaccine is at an early stage. We have not previously tested our rapid response capability and may be unable to produce a vaccine that successfully treats the virus in a timely manner, if at all.\nIn response to the global outbreak of COVID-19, we are pursuing the rapid development of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Our development of the vaccine is in early stages, and we may be unable to produce a vaccine that successfully treats the virus in a timely manner, if at all. Additionally, our ability to develop an effective vaccine depends on the success of our rapid response capability, which we have not previously tested and which will need to be funded by third parties in order to enable us to have sufficient capacity to respond to a global health challenge. If the outbreak is effectively contained or the risk of coronavirus infection is diminished or eliminated before we can successfully develop and manufacture the COVID-19 Vaccine, we may be unable to successfully generate revenue from the manufacturing of the COVID-19 Vaccine. We are also committing financial resources and personnel to the development of the COVID-19 Vaccine which may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other business operations, despite uncertainties surrounding the longevity and extent of coronavirus as a global health concern. Our business could be negatively impacted by our allocation of significant resources to a global health threat that is unpredictable and could rapidly dissipate or against which our vaccine, if developed, may not be partially or fully effective.\nFurthermore, the biotechnology market is highly competitive, is subject to rapid technological change and is significantly affected by existing rival drugs and medical procedures, new product introductions and the market activities of other participants. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations may pursue the research and development of a vaccine to treat COVID-19. Our competitors may develop products more rapidly or more effectively than us. If our competitors are more successful in commercializing their products than us, their success could adversely affect our competitive position and harm our business prospects and may also lead to the diversion of funding away from us and toward other companies.\nIf we are successful in producing the COVID-19 Vaccine, we may need to devote significant resources to its scale-up and development including for use by the U.S. government.\nIn the event that the preclinical and clinical trials for the COVID-19 Vaccine are perceived to be successful, we may need to work toward the large scale technical development, manufacturing scale-up and larger scale deployment of this potential vaccine through a variety of U.S. government mechanisms such as an Expanded Access Program or an Emergency Use Authorization program. In this case we may need to divert significant resources to this program, which would require diversion of resources from our other businesses. In addition, since the path to licensure of any vaccine against COVID-19 is unclear, if use of the vaccine is mandated by the U.S. government, we may have a widely used vaccine in circulation in the United States or another country prior to our full validation of the overall long term safety and efficacy profile of our vaccine platform and technology. Unexpected safety issues in these circumstances could lead to significant reputational damage for the Company going forward and other issues, including delays in our other programs, the need for re-design of our clinical trials and the need for significant additional financial resources.\nWe may be unable to advance the COVID-19 Vaccine successfully through the preclinical and clinical development process.\nOur ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and ultimately commercialize, the COVID-19 Vaccine effectively will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials;\nsuccessful achievement of the objectives of planned preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;\n\u25cf establishing efficient and effective commercial manufacturing, supply and distribution arrangements;\n\u25cf establishing sufficient market share and promoting acceptance of the product by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u25cf successfully executing an effective pricing and reimbursement strategy;\n\u25cf maintaining a continued acceptable safety and adverse event profile following regulatory approval; and\n\u25cf qualifying for, identifying, registering, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims.\nThe COVID-19 Vaccine will require additional non-clinical and clinical development, regulatory review and approval, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can be in a position to generate any revenue from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote any vaccine before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval. If we are unable to develop or receive marketing approval in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to commercialize the COVID-19 vaccine, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to our dependence on a limited number of customers and the loss of any such customer would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had two principal U.S. customers: Cardinal Health, Inc. (\u201cCardinal Health\u201d) and Fisher Healthcare (\u201cFisher\u201d). Each has the non-exclusive right to distribute PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assays within the U.S. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Cardinal Health and Fisher accounted for approximately 79% of our product revenue.\nBecause of our dependence on a limited number of key customers, the loss of a major customer (or loss of a key program with a major customer), or any significant reduction in orders by a major customer or termination of any of their distribution agreements would materially affect our business, our results of operations and our financial condition. We expect that sales to relatively few customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future, however there can be no assurance that any of these customers or any of our other customers will continue to utilize our products or our services at current levels.\nDue to our dependence on a limited number of customers, we are subject to a concentration of credit risk.\nAs of December 31, 2019, five customers accounted for 83% of trade receivables net of customer credits and allowance for doubtful accounts, as compared to December 31, 2018, where two customers accounted for 99% of such trade receivables. In the case of insolvency by one of our significant customers, a trade receivable with respect to that customer might not be collectible, might not be fully collectible, or might be collectible over longer than normal terms, each of which could adversely affect our financial position.\nOur business would suffer if we were unable to acquire adequate sources of supply.\nWe use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products. We purchase all of our raw materials and select items, such as packaging, from external suppliers. In addition, we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of proprietary know-how, quality assurance, sole source availability, or due to regulatory qualification requirements and disruption of these sources could have, at a minimum, a temporary adverse effect on shipments and the financial results of our company. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Any prolonged inability to obtain certain materials or components could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and could result in damage to our relationships with our customers and, accordingly, adversely affect our business.\nWe expect to require additional capital in the future in order to pursue strategic alternative transactions. If we do not obtain any such additional financing, it may be difficult to effectively realize our long-term strategic goals and objectives.\nTo execute our long-term business strategy, we expect to require additional financing and in connection therewith to issue additional equity securities in public or private offerings. If we cannot secure this additional funding when such funds are required, we may be forced to forego certain strategic opportunities.\nAny additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-backed securities may dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the market value of our equity securities.\nThe terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then outstanding.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition.\nBecause we may not be able to maintain or obtain necessary regulatory clearances for some of our products, we may not generate revenue in the amounts we expect, or in the amounts necessary to continue our business.\nAll of our existing products are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FDA and/or other domestic and international governmental, public health agencies, regulatory bodies or non-governmental organizations. In particular, we are subject to strict governmental controls on the development, manufacture, labeling, distribution and marketing of our products and may not be able to maintain the necessary regulatory clearances for some of our products.\nThe process of obtaining required approvals or clearances for a potential new product varies according to the nature of and uses for a specific product. These processes can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory testing, human clinical trials, sampling activities, and other costly, time-consuming procedures. The submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that the authority will grant an approval or clearance for the product. Each authority may impose its own requirements and can delay or refuse to grant approval or clearance, even though a product has been approved in another country.\nThe time taken to obtain approval or clearance varies depending on the nature of the application and may result in the passage of a significant period of time from the date of submission of the application. Delays in the approval or clearance processes increase the risk that we will not succeed in introducing or selling the subject products, and we may be required to abandon a proposed product after devoting substantial time and resources to its development.\nChanges in domestic and foreign government regulations could increase our costs and could require us to undergo additional trials or procedures, or could make it impractical or impossible for us to market our products for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all.\nChanges in government regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations because we may have to incur additional expenses if we are required to change or implement new testing, manufacturing and control procedures. If we are required to devote resources to develop such new procedures, we may not have sufficient resources to devote to research and development, marketing, or other activities that are critical to our business.\nWe are subject to ongoing regulation by various government agencies, and, if we are unable to comply with such regulations, our products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and/or we could be subject to a wide-range of enforcement actions, any of which would materially affect our business.\nIn the United States, medical devices, including in vitro diagnostics, are subject to extensive regulation by FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (\u201cFD&C\u201d) Act and its implementing regulations, along with other federal and state statutes and regulations. To be lawfully marketed in the United States, medical devices must generally receive 510(k) clearance or premarket approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) from the FDA. All of our currently commercial devices have received 510(k) clearance.\nAfter the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: compliance with the Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d), which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations; the FDA\u2019s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses; the reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk of health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act; and the Medical Device Reporting (\u201cMDR\u201d) regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur. Manufacturers are also required to register and list their devices with the FDA, based on which the FDA will conduct inspections to ensure continued compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nThe FDA has broad post-market and regulatory and enforcement powers. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters; fines; injunctions; consent decrees; civil penalties; repairs, replacements or refunds; recalls, corrections or seizures of products; total or partial suspension of production; the FDA\u2019s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals; withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications; and criminal prosecution. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could dissuade some people with brain related disorders from using our products and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived accuracy and safety of our products. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, as a U.S. medical device manufacturer, we must operate our production facility in accordance with the QSR requirements established by the FDA under the FD&C Act. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and recordkeeping. As such, we have implemented a quality system that is intended to comply with applicable regulations. Our manufacturing plant is subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, and at last inspection, the facility was found to be in substantial compliance with current good manufacturing practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements. cGMP requirements could change and negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products without modifications to our operating procedures or changes to our equipment or human resource allocations which may materially affect our business. If the FDA believes that our manufacturing practices are not compliant with applicable QSR requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions, then we cannot market our products in those jurisdictions.\nMany foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the FDA. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ. Companies are now required to obtain a CE Mark, which shows conformance with the requirements of applicable European Conformity directives, prior to the sale of some medical devices within the European Union. Some of our current products that require CE Markings have them. We may be required to conduct additional testing or to provide additional information, resulting in additional expenses, to obtain necessary approvals. If we fail to obtain approval in such foreign jurisdictions, we would not be able to sell our products in such jurisdictions, thereby reducing the potential revenue from the sale of our products.\nWe may be unable to market our products outside the United States if our products cannot meet certain requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act requirements for exporting medical devices.\nAny medical device that is legally marketed in the U.S. may be exported anywhere in the world without prior FDA notification or approval. Medical devices that are not FDA-cleared for marketing legally in the U.S. may be exported under section 801(e)(1) of the FD&C Act, provided that they are intended for export only, they are class I or class II devices, and they are:\n\u25cf In accordance with the specifications of the foreign purchaser;\n\u25cf Not in conflict with the laws of the country to which they are intended for export;\n\u25cf Labeled on the outside of the shipping package that they are intended for export; and\n\u25cf Not sold or distributed in the U.S.\nWe cannot guarantee that certain current and future products will meet all of the aforementioned specifications for export which could adversely impact our ability to market our products outside the U.S.\nModifications to our devices may require additional FDA clearance or approval, which could force us to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until we obtain new approvals.\nAfter a device receives a 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a Premarket approval (\u201cPMA\u201d). The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer\u2019s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified devices until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained, among other enforcement actions. We have modified one of our prescription use, 510(k)-cleared devices, specifically the PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay, to include our seraSTAT device. However, we determined that, in our view, based on FDA guidance as to when to submit a 510(k) notification for changes to a cleared device, a new 510(k) clearance was not required. We cannot assure you that the FDA would agree with any of our decisions not to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for any modification, we also may be required to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until we obtain a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign the product.\nWe are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA to determine compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply, the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions which may materially affect our business operations.\nWe are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA to determine compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply, the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as:\n\u25cf fines, injunctions and civil penalties;\n\u25cf recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u25cf the issuance of public notices or warnings;\n\u25cf operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf refusing our requests for a 510(k) clearance of new products;\n\u25cf withdrawing a 510(k) clearance already granted; and\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nThe FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. Our failure to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur marketed products may be used by physicians for indications that are not cleared by the FDA. If the FDA finds that we promoted one or more of our products for off-label use(s), we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nUnder the FD&C Act and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for \u201coff-label\u201d uses. This means that we may not make claims about the use of any of our marketed medical device products outside of their cleared indications, and that our website, advertising promotional materials and training methods may not promote or encourage any unapproved uses. Therefore, we may not provide information to physicians or patients that promote off-label uses, except in limited circumstances. Should the FDA determine that we have engaged in the promotion of any of our device products for off-label uses, the FDA could bring a wide range of enforcement actions against us and/or our executives. In addition, failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising can result in, among other things, the FDA\u2019s refusal to approve or clear products, the withdrawal of an approved product from the market, product recalls, fines, disgorgement of profits, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecutions. Any of these adverse regulatory actions could result in substantial costs and could significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to potential FDA enforcement, the Department of Justice, as well as state attorneys general, may work with the FDA or on their own to bring enforcement action against us and/or our executives in connection with any off-label promotion of our products. Such action may include civil and criminal penalties, including significant fines, among other serious consequences. Even if we are successful in resolving such matters without incurring penalties, responding to investigations or prosecutions will likely result in substantial costs and could significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and ability to finance our operations. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of injury to patients, and, in turn, the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention and result in substantial damage awards against us.\nWe may not have the resources to conduct clinical protocols sufficient to yield data suitable for publication in peer-reviewed journals and our inability to do so in the future could have an adverse effect on marketing our products effectively.\nIn order for our products targeted for use by hospital laboratory professionals and healthcare providers to be widely adopted, we would have to conduct clinical protocols that are designed to yield data suitable for publication in peer-reviewed journals. These studies are often time-consuming, labor-intensive and expensive to execute. We have not had the resources to effectively implement such clinical programs within our clinical development activities and may not be able to do so in the future. In addition, if a protocol is initiated, the results of which may ultimately not support the anticipated positioning and benefit proposition for the product. Either of these scenarios could hinder our ability to market our products and revenue may decline.\nIf we fail to establish, maintain and expand relationships with distributors, sales of our products would decline.\nWe do not control the efforts of our distributors and our distributors are not prohibited from selling competing products. Our ability to sell our products depends largely on our relationships with such distributors. Accordingly, we are subject to the risk that they may not commit the financial and other resources to market and sell our products to our level of expectation, they may experience financial hardship or they may otherwise terminate our relationship on short notice. In the U.S. clinical laboratory marketplace, many of our existing and potential customers purchase our products through our two national distributors, Cardinal Health and Fisher Health. In addition, we rely on our distribution network to negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts with Group Purchasing Organizations and their affiliated hospitals and other members. For the year ended December 31, 2019, two customers generated 48 % and 31 %, or 79 % in the aggregate, of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2018, two customers generated 57%, and 14%, or 71% in the aggregate, of our revenue. In the future, if we are unable to maintain existing relationships, our competitive position would likely suffer and our business would be harmed.\nOur business is vulnerable to the availability of raw materials, our ability to forecast customer demand and our ability to manage production capacity.\nOur ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our production capacity and on obtaining supplies, a number of which can only be obtained from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. A reduction or disruption in our production capacity or our supplies could delay products and fulfillment of orders and otherwise negatively impact our business.\nWe must accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials. If we overestimate demand, we may experience underutilized capacity and excess inventory levels. If we underestimate demand, we may miss delivery deadlines and sales opportunities and incur additional costs for labor overtime, equipment overuse and logistical complexities. Additionally, our production capacity could be affected by manufacturing problems. Difficulties in the production process could reduce yields or interrupt production, and, as a result, we may not be able to deliver products on time or in a cost-effective, competitive manner. Our failure to adequately manage our capacity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to meet customer demand also depends on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials, parts and components from our suppliers. We generally do not maintain contracts with any of our key suppliers. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit the amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Supply disruptions may also occur due to shortages in critical materials. In addition, a number of our raw materials are obtained from a single supplier. Many of our suppliers must undertake a time-consuming qualification process before we can incorporate their raw materials into our production process. If we are unable to obtain materials from a qualified supplier, it can take up to a year to qualify a new supplier, assuming an alternative source of supply is available. A reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of one or more supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our finished goods, including our PIFA products and control materials related to PIFA Heparin/PF4 assays, are temperature-sensitive.\nProper packaging and time in transit are critical to the stability of some of our clinical laboratory products when they are en route to our distributors or end users. If certain specialized packaging materials cannot be obtained, and/or if our contracted common carriers, or those of our distributors, cannot meet product-specific delivery requirements, our products may not perform as intended and may lead to requests for product replacement. If such issues become widespread, it could hurt our reputation and we could potentially lose customers which would adversely affect our business.\nAlso, given the issue of temperature sensitivity, time in transit may limit our ability to service potential markets outside of the U.S. for those products, especially those with geographies that do not allow for shipment and customs clearance within four business days. This could adversely affect our potential to generate revenue for some products on an international level.\nDemands of third-party payors, cost reduction pressures among our customers and restrictive reimbursement practices may adversely affect our revenue.\nOur ability to negotiate favorable contracts with non-governmental payors, including managed-care plans or Group Purchasing Organizations (\u201cGPOs\u201d), even if facilitated by our distributors, may significantly affect revenue and operating results. Our customers continue to face cost reduction pressures that may cause them to curtail their use of, or reimbursement for some of our products, to negotiate reduced prices or other concessions or to delay payment. Furthermore, the increasing leverage of organized buying groups among non-governmental payors may reduce market prices for our products and services, thereby reducing our profitability. Reductions in price increases or the amounts received from current customers or lower pricing for our products to new customers could have a material adverse effect on the financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nFailure to obtain medical reimbursement for our products, as well as a changing regulatory and reimbursement environment, may impact our business.\nThe U.S. healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts our ability to market our products due to medical coverage or reimbursement limits. Sales of our diagnostic tests will depend in part on the extent to which the costs of such tests are covered by health maintenance, managed care, and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health payor administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. These healthcare payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments. Accordingly, our products may not be considered to be cost effective, and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that are difficult to predict and these changes may have an adverse effect to us.\nCMS, the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, along with its contractors establishes coverage and reimbursement policies for the Medicare program. In addition, private payors often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare. We cannot assure you that government or private third-party payors will cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate.\nFor some of our products, our success in non-U.S. markets may depend upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from the third-party payors through which health care providers are paid in those markets. Health care payment systems in non-U.S. markets vary significantly by country, and include single-payor, government managed systems as well as systems in which private payors and government-managed systems exist, side-by-side. For some of our products, our ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume in international markets may be dependent on the availability of reimbursement for our products under health care payment systems in such markets. There can be no assurance that reimbursement for our products will be obtained or that such reimbursement will be adequate.\nWe may experience delays in any phase of the preclinical or clinical development of a product, including during its research and development.\nThe completion of any of these studies may be delayed or halted for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical study protocol or place a clinical study on hold;\n\u25cf patients do not enroll in a clinical study or results from patients are not received at the expected rate;\n\u25cf patients discontinue participation in a clinical study prior to the scheduled endpoint at a higher than expected rate;\n\u25cf patients experience adverse events from a product we develop;\n\u25cf third-party clinical investigators do not perform the studies in accordance with the anticipated schedule or consistent with the study protocol and good clinical practices or other third-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u25cf third-party clinical investigators engage in activities that, even if not directly associated with our studies, result in their debarment, loss of licensure, or other legal or regulatory sanction;\n\u25cf regulatory inspections of manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend the preclinical or clinical studies;\n\u25cf changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions;\n\u25cf the interim results of the preclinical or clinical study, if any, are inconclusive or negative; and\n\u25cf the study design, although approved and completed, is inadequate to demonstrate effectiveness and safety.\nIf the preclinical and clinical studies that we are required to conduct to gain regulatory approval are delayed or unsuccessful, we may not be able to market any product that we develop in the future. Preclinical studies and clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement and any delays or prolongment in our preclinical and clinical studies will require additional capital. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire additional capital to support our studies. The failure to obtain additional capital would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nWe anticipate that we will rely completely on third parties to manufacture certain preclinical and all clinical drug supplies. Our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of drug product, or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our preclinical and clinical drug supplies for use in the conduct of our clinical studies, and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. In order to develop products, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize our products, we will need to develop, contract for, or otherwise arrange for access to the necessary manufacturing capabilities. We anticipate that we will rely on CMOs, or contract manufacturing organizations, and other third party contractors, some of whom may have limited cGMP experience, to manufacture formulations and produce larger scale amounts of drug substance and the drug product required for any clinical trials that we initiate.\nThe manufacturing process for any vaccine candidate is subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authority approval process, and we will need to contract with manufacturers who can meet all applicable FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements on an ongoing basis. In addition, if we receive the necessary regulatory approval for any product candidate, we also expect to rely on third parties to produce materials required for commercial supply. We may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate manufacturing capacity for our needs. Furthermore, it is our responsibility to ensure that all of our third-party contractors meet cGMP laws, regulations and guidance. Due to their failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may face fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of products. If we are unable to obtain or maintain contract manufacturing for these product candidates, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our products.\nTo the extent that we enter into manufacturing arrangements with third parties, we will depend on these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner and consistent with regulatory requirements, including those related to quality control and quality assurance. The failure of a third-party manufacturer to perform its obligations as expected could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including:\n\u25cf we may not be able to initiate or continue preclinical and clinical trials of products that are under development;\n\u25cf we may need to repeat pivotal clinical trials;\n\u25cf we may be delayed in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving regulatory approvals, for our product candidates;\n\u25cf we may lose the cooperation of our collaborators;\n\u25cf our products could be the subject of inspections by regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf we may be required to cease distribution or recall some or all batches of our products; and\n\u25cf ultimately, we may not be able to meet commercial demands for our products.\nIf a third-party manufacturer with whom we contract fails to perform its obligations, we may be forced to seek out one or more other third-party manufacturers to manufacture our preclinical and/or clinical trial materials, which could cause delays in the FDA approval process. Further, should our vaccine candidate be approved for marketing by the FDA, a change in a third-party manufacturer could cause significant delays to meeting the demand of patients. In some cases, the technical skills required to manufacture our product may be unique to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty transferring such skills to a back-up or alternate manufacturer, or we may be unable to transfer such skills at all. In addition, if we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. We will also be required to demonstrate that the newly manufactured material is the same or similar to the previously manufactured material, or we may need to repeat clinical trials with the newly manufactured material. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates in a timely manner or within budget. Furthermore, a manufacturer may possess technology related to the manufacture of our product candidate that such manufacturer owns independently, which would increase our reliance on such manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from such manufacturer in order to have another third party manufacture our products.\nWe intend to rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and perform other tasks for us. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines, or comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be substantially harmed.\nWe plan to rely upon third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to monitor and manage data for our licensed ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. We expect to continue to rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we maintain responsibility for ensuring that each of our clinical trials and preclinical studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards and our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs and other vendors are required to comply with cGMP, current Good Clinical Practices or cGCP, and current Good Laboratory Practices, or cGLP, which are a collection of laws and regulations enforced by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these regulations through periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities, preclinical study and clinical trial sponsors, principal investigators, preclinical study and clinical trial sites, and other contractors. If we or any of our CROs or vendors fails to comply with applicable regulations, the data generated in our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign authorities may require us to perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products manufactured consistently with cGMP regulations. Failure by us or our third party CRO to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the development and regulatory approval processes.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators or contract laboratories terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, or comply with cGCP laws, regulations and guidance, or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. CROs may also generate higher costs than anticipated. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates could be materially and adversely affected, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nSwitching or adding additional CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators or contract laboratories involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work replacing a previous CRO. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines.\nThe COVID-19 Vaccine that we develop in the future will be subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization.\nRigorous preclinical studies, clinical trials and extensive regulatory approval processes are required to be successfully completed in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new product may be offered and sold in any of these countries or regions. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time-consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays.\nIn the United States, the products that we intend to develop and market are regulated by the FDA under its drug development and review process. The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals for any product that we develop in the future is inherently unpredictable. Before such products can be marketed, we must obtain clearance from the FDA first through submission of an investigational new drug (\u201cIND\u201d), then through successful completion of human testing under three phases of clinical trials and finally through submission of a new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d). Even after successful completion of clinical testing, there is a risk that the FDA may request further information from us, disagree with our findings or otherwise undertake a lengthy review of our NDA submission.\nThere can be no assurance that the FDA will grant a license for any NDA that we may submit. It is possible that none of the products that we develop in the future will obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals necessary for us to commence the offer and sale of such products. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from a particular prospective product.\nIf we decide to market any drug that we develop in jurisdictions in addition to the United States, we may incur the same costs or more in satisfying foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of preclinical and clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing and commercialization of any product that we develop in the future. Approval by the FDA by itself does not assure approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States. Each of these foreign regulatory approval processes includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process, as well as risks attributable to having to satisfy local regulations within each of these foreign jurisdictions. Our inability to obtain regulatory approval outside the United States may adversely compromise our business prospects\nWe may fail to retain qualified personnel.\nWe have substantially reduced the number of our employees in order to reduce our costs. Accordingly, retaining our remaining personnel in the future will be critical to our success. If we fail to retain and motivate these highly skilled personnel, we may be unable to continue our operating activities, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe rely on the key executive officer of the management team.\nWe are dependent on our management team to execute against our business plan. Failure could result in delays in product development, loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nExpenses incurred with respect to monitoring, protecting, and defending our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nCompetitors and others may infringe on our intellectual property rights, or may allege that we have infringed on theirs. Monitoring infringement and misappropriation of intellectual property can be difficult and expensive, and we may not be able to detect infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use of, our technology.\nSome or all of our patent applications may not result in the issue of patents, or the claims of any issued patents may not afford meaningful protection for our technologies or products. In addition, patents issued to us or our licensors, if any, may be challenged and subsequently narrowed, invalidated, found unenforceable or circumvented. Patent litigation is widespread in the biotechnology industry and could harm our business. Litigation might be necessary to protect our patent position. Patentability, invalidity, freedom-to-operate or other opinions may be required to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. If we choose to go to court to stop a third party from using the inventions protected by our patent, that third party would have the right to ask the court to rule that such patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and we may not have the required resources to pursue such litigation or to protect our patent rights. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that our patents are not valid or that we cannot stop the other party from using their inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will find that the third party\u2019s activities do not infringe our rights in these patents.\nFurthermore, a third party may claim that we are infringing the third party\u2019s patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our products or product candidates. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party\u2019s treble damages or attorneys\u2019 fees for having violated the other party\u2019s patents. The biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either do not infringe the claims of the relevant patent and/or that the third-party patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity in the United Sates is difficult since it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nIn addition, changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we have no knowledge of any claims against us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. To date, none of our employees have been subject to such claims.\nWe may be at risk that our former employees may wrongfully use or disclose our trade secrets.\nIn addition to patent protection, we rely heavily upon know-how and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee, former employee, consultant, former consultant or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed.\nThe marketing, sale, and use of our PIFA products and any other devices we currently manufacture or may manufacture in the future could result in serious injuries, product liability claims, regulatory enforcement action, and/or recalls or market withdrawals, any of which would likely subject us to substantial costs and reputational harm and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends on the market\u2019s confidence that we can continue to provide reliable, high-quality diagnostic tests. We believe that our customers are likely to be particularly sensitive to test defects and errors, as the conditions that the PIFA products are designed to identify may cause limb- and life-threatening complications if not accurately diagnosed in a timely manner. As a result, the failure of our tests or services to perform as expected could impair our reputation and the public image of our tests and services, and we may be subject to legal claims arising from any defects or errors.\nThe marketing, sale, and use of our PIFA products and our other products could lead to product liability (and other similar) claims against us if someone were to allege that one of our tests failed to perform as it was designed or as claimed in our promotional materials, was performed pursuant to incorrect or inadequate laboratory procedures, if we delivered incorrect or incomplete test results, or if someone were to misinterpret test results. In addition, we may be subject to liability for errors in, a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide, or for failure to provide such information, in connection with our marketing and promotional activities or as part of the results generated by our products. A product liability or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend.\nWhile our PIFA products are highly accurate, they are not 100% accurate and may generate erroneous results that could cause patient harm. For example, PIFA could provide a so-called \u201cfalse negative\u201d result upon which a patient or physician may rely to make a conclusion about how to proceed with the patient\u2019s treatment. If the false negative causes, or exacerbates, a patient injury or condition, the patient (and/or the patient\u2019s family) may file a lawsuit against us based on product liability. On July 25, 2019, we received a product-liability petition, alleging that multiple false-negative PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay results caused a patient\u2019s treating hospital to delay the appropriate diagnosis by several days, which, the petition argues, was a substantial contributing factor in the ultimate amputation of the patient\u2019s left leg. We are contesting this action vigorously and believe our product liability insurance will be adequate to cover any costs incurred in connection with this matter. However, we cannot guarantee that our insurance will fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against product liability claims or any judgments, fines, or settlement costs arising out of any such claims.\nAny product liability or professional liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates, cause our insurance coverage to be terminated or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability or professional liability lawsuit could harm our reputation, result in a cessation of our services or cause our partners to terminate our agreements with them, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nFurther, under the FDA\u2019s MDR regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. For example, once brought to our attention, we reported the injury described above in connection with alleged false-negative PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay results. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall, which could divert managerial and financial resources, impair our ability to manufacture our products in a cost-effective and timely manner and have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nAny adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or regulatory agency action, which could include inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nWe currently manufacture our products at a single location. Any disruption at this facility could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe currently manufacture all our products at our manufacturing plant. If our manufacturing plant were damaged or destroyed, or otherwise subject to disruption, it would require substantial lead-time to replace or rebuild the facility for the manufacture of our products. In such event, we would be forced to rely entirely on third-party contract manufacturers for an indefinite period of time. We do not currently have established relationships with any back-up manufacturers. Even if we are able to establish a relationship with a third-party manufacturer, there is no assurance that such manufacturer will be able to meet our needs from a technical, timing, or cost effective manner.\nWe are currently subject to a number of securities litigations and we may be subject to similar or other litigation in the future.\nWe are currently subject to a number of litigations as described in the \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d section. In connection with certain of these litigations, we have entered into settlements of claims for significant monetary damages. We may also be subject to judgements or enter into additional settlements of claims for significant monetary damages for the securities litigations that we have yet to enter into settlement agreements. Defending against the current litigations is or can be time-consuming, expensive and cause diversion of our management\u2019s attention.\nWith respect to any litigation, our insurance may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for the expenses or losses we may suffer in contesting and concluding such lawsuit. Substantial litigation costs, including the substantial self-insured retention that we are required to satisfy before any insurance applies to a claim, unreimbursed legal fees or an adverse result in any litigation may adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition. We believe that our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance will cover our potential liability with respect to the securities class-action lawsuit; however, the insurer has reserved its rights to contest the applicability of the insurance to such claims and the limits of the insurance may be insufficient to cover our eventual liability.\nWe face substantial competition from other companies and our operating results may suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nCompetition among providers of rapid, point-of-care screening and testing products is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards. We compete with many companies that have greater financial, product development, sales and marketing resources and experience than we do. Furthermore, new product development and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors. We must continue to develop and commercialize new products and technologies to remain competitive in the diagnostic testing industry. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our single-use testing. Customer and clinical support, and data that demonstrate both improvement in a patient\u2019s quality of life and a product\u2019s cost-effectiveness are additional aspects of competition.\nWe are aware of other rapid, point-of-care screening and diagnostic testing products in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Specifically, Abbott, ACON Laboratories, Inc., Immucor, Inc., OraSure Technologies, Inc., and Quidel Corporation are companies that develop rapid, point-of-care screening and diagnostic testing products and currently maintain dominant market positions within the diagnostic testing market.\nIf we market products or interact with health care practitioners in a manner that violates healthcare fraud or abuse laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.\nWe receive payments directly from or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other national or third-party payers for our current product, U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud or abuse are and will be applicable to our business. We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation by the U.S. federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.\nThe laws that may affect our ability to operate include the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, the purchase, lease or order, or arrangement for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute applies to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.\nFederal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product, reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates, engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered off-label uses and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 also created prohibitions against healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. The false statements statute immediately noted above prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians. The ACA, through the Physician Payment Sunshine Act of 2010, imposed new requirements on manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members and payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d to such physician owners and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to report such data to the government by the 90th calendar day of each year.\nThe majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to these federal laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. In addition, some states have laws that require pharmaceutical companies to adopt comprehensive compliance programs. For example, under California law, pharmaceutical companies must comply with both the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and the PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals, as amended. Moreover, certain states mandate the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration paid by us to physicians and other healthcare providers.\nAlthough compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, cause reputational harm and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state laws may prove costly.\nData security breaches may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur network security and data recovery measures and those of third parties with which we contract, may not be adequate to protect against computer viruses, cyber-attacks, breaches, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. The misappropriation, theft, sabotage or any other type of security breach with respect to any of our proprietary and confidential information that is electronically stored, including patient data, could cause interruptions in our operations, could result in a material disruption of our business operations and could expose us to third-party legal claims. Furthermore, we could be required to make substantial expenditures of resources to remedy the cause of cyber-attacks or break-ins. This disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business processes personal medical information. The use of this information is critical to our operations and innovation. New and evolving regulations could bring increased scrutiny of our data management in the future. Any cyber-attacks or other failure to protect critical and sensitive systems and information could damage our reputation, prompt litigation or lead to regulatory sanctions, all of which could materially affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe are subject to various internal control reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We can provide no assurance that we will at all times in the future be able to report that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with Section 404 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d). In any given year, we cannot be certain as to the time of completion of our internal control evaluation, testing and remediation actions or of their impact on our operations. Upon completion of this process, we may identify control deficiencies of varying degrees of severity under applicable SEC and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (U.S.) rules and regulations. Our management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIn addition, as a public company, we are required to report, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute material weaknesses or changes in internal controls that, or that are reasonably likely to, materially affect internal controls over financial reporting. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if we report a material weakness, we might be subject to regulatory sanction and investors may lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements, which may be inaccurate if we fail to remedy such material weakness.\nWe incur increased costs and demands on management as a result of compliance with laws and regulations applicable to public companies, which could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market, impose a number of requirements on public companies, including with respect to corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance and disclosure obligations. Moreover, compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and has made some activities more time-consuming and costly. It is also more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nOur business may be materially adversely affected by the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 could disrupt our operations due to absenteeism by infected or ill members of management or other employees, or absenteeism by members of management and other employees who elect not to come to work due to the illness affecting others in our office or laboratory facilities, or due to quarantines. COVID-19 illness could also impact members of our Board of Directors resulting in absenteeism from meetings of the directors or committees of directors, and making it more difficult to convene the quorums of the full Board of Directors or its committees needed to conduct meetings for the management of our affairs.\nSupplies could be disrupted if the manufacturers or suppliers of our products experience absenteeism due to illness of their employees or due to local quarantines. Absenteeism due to coronavirus illness could also impact companies that the suppliers use to ship products to us. We cannot presently predict the extent to which the virus may impact our operations.\nThe anticipated economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted financial markets, resulting in high share price volatility, reduced market liquidity, and substantial declines in the market prices of the shares of most publicly traded companies, including Akers. Volatile or declining markets for equities could adversely affect our ability to raise capital when needed through the sale of shares of common stock or other equity securities. While these market conditions persist when we need to raise capital, and if we are able to sell shares of our common stock under then prevailing market conditions, we might have to accept lower prices for our shares and issue a larger number of shares than might have been the case under better market conditions, resulting in significant dilution of the interests of our shareholders.\nRisks Related to our Pursuit of Strategic Alternatives\nWe may opportunistically review strategic transactions and there can be no assurance that that any such strategic transaction we may purse will result in additional value for our stockholders.\nIn November 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors had initiated a process to evaluate strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. The Company sought to explore how to leverage its 30 years of operational history in its medical device business, where its current products have FDA clearance, its current operations practice Good Manufacturing Processes (cGMP), its medical device facility is certified under ISO 13485 - 2016 and the facility carries an Analytical Lab Certification for Schedules 2, 3, 4 and 5 controlled substances issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the State of New Jersey. The Company intends to pursue opportunities in the extraction, testing, purification and formulation of safe cannabinoids within the hemp industry, including pathways to consumer products with a focus on minor cannabinoids. To the extent we engage in other strategic transactions, the process may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We could incur substantial expenses associated with evaluating and negotiating potential strategic alternatives. Furthermore, our ability to effectively integrate any future acquisitions will depend on, among other things, the adequacy of our implementation plans, the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operational efficiencies. If we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of any businesses that we may acquire in the future, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that any potential transaction, if consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current price of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, our business could be harmed.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may acquire other companies or businesses. However, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our operating results, including:\n\u25cf difficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company;\n\u25cf difficulties in supporting and transitioning clients and suppliers, if any, of an acquired company;\n\u25cf diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities;\n\u25cf failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\n\u25cf failure to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or client issues;\n\u25cf risks of entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees, clients, vendors and suppliers from either our current business or an acquired company\u2019s business;\n\u25cf inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs;\n\u25cf additional costs or equity dilution associated with funding the acquisition; and\n\u25cf possible write-offs or impairment charges relating to acquired businesses.\nIf we acquire a new business, or retain individuals with expertise in a new industry to pursue a strategic alternative, we will have a limited operating history in such new industry, specifically the cannabis industry, and may not succeed.\nWe will have a limited operating history within the cannabis industry and may not succeed. We will be subject to all risks inherent in a developing business enterprise. The likelihood of our continued viability must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with manufacturing specialty products and the competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate. For example, the cannabis industry is a new industry that, as a whole, may not succeed, particularly if the Federal government changes course and decides to prosecute those dealing in cannabis under Federal law. If that happens, there may not be an adequate market for our products. As a new industry, there are not established players on whose business models we can follow or build upon. Similarly, there is limited information about comparable companies available for potential investors to review in making a decision about whether to invest in our company. Furthermore, as the industrial hemp industry is a new market, it is ripe for technological advancements that could limit or eliminate the need for our products. Furthermore, unanticipated expenses, problems, and technical difficulties may occur and they may result in material delays in the operation of our business, in particular with respect to our new products. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and uncertainties or successfully implement our operating strategies. If we fail to do so, such failure could materially harm our business to the point of having to cease operations and could impair the value of our common stock to the point investors may lose their entire investment.\nIf we acquire a business in the cannabis industry or otherwise pursues a strategic alternative, we would face additional unique and evolving risks.\nFurther legislative development beneficial to the cannabis industry is not guaranteed\nIf we acquire a business in the cannabis industry or otherwise pursues a strategic alternative, the success of such business would depend on the continued development of the cannabis industry and the activity of commercial business and government regulatory agencies within the industry. The continued development of the cannabis industry is dependent upon continued legislative and regulatory authorization of cannabis at the state level and a continued laissez-faire approach by federal enforcement agencies. Any number of factors could slow or halt progress in this area. Further regulatory progress beneficial to the industry cannot be assured. While there may be ample public support for legislative action, numerous factors impact the legislative and regulatory process, including election results, scientific findings or general public events. Any one of these factors could slow or halt progressive legislation relating to cannabis and the current tolerance for the use of cannabis by consumers, which could adversely affect the business we may acquire or pursue. These changes may require us, should we acquire a business or otherwise pursues a strategic alternative in the cannabis industry, to incur substantial costs associated with legal and compliance fees and ultimately require us to alter our business plan. Furthermore, violations of these laws, or alleged violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, and it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to the business we may acquire or pursue.\nThe cannabis industry could face strong opposition from other industries\nWe believe that established businesses in other industries may have a strong economic interest in opposing the development of the cannabis industry. Cannabis may be seen by companies in other industries as an attractive alternative to their products, including recreational marijuana as an alternative to alcohol, and medical marijuana as an alternative to various commercial pharmaceuticals. Many industries that could view the emerging cannabis industry as an economic threat are well established, with vast economic and federal and state lobbying resources. It is possible that companies within these industries could use their resources to attempt to slow or reverse legislation legalizing cannabis. Any inroads these companies make in halting or impeding legislative initiatives that would be beneficial to the cannabis industry could have a detrimental impact on our potential business.\nThe legality of marijuana could be reversed in one or more states\nThere is a substantial amount of change occurring in the U.S. regarding the use of medical and recreational marijuana products. While federal law prohibits the sale and distribution of cannabis products not approved or authorized by the FDA, at least 30 jurisdictions and the District of Columbia have enacted state laws to enable possession and use of marijuana in some form for medical purposes, and at least ten jurisdictions for recreational purposes. However, notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment in some states, marijuana continues to be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act and, thus, engaging in commercial activities involving such products violates federal law. Further, the voters or legislatures of states in which marijuana has already been legalized could potentially repeal applicable laws which permit the operation of both medical and retail marijuana businesses. These actions might force our potential business to cease operations in one or more states entirely.\nBanking regulations could limit access to banking services\nSince the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, there is a compelling argument that banks cannot lawfully accept for deposit funds from businesses involved with marijuana. Consequently, businesses involved in the cannabis industry often have trouble finding a bank willing to accept their business. The inability to open bank accounts may make it difficult for our potential business to operate and our reliance on cash could result in a heightened risk of theft. Additionally, some courts have denied marijuana-related businesses bankruptcy protection, thus, making it very difficult for lenders to recoup their investments, which may limit the willingness of banks to lend to us.\nInsurance risks\nIn the United States, many marijuana-related businesses are subject to a lack of adequate insurance coverage. In addition, many insurance companies may deny claims for any loss relating to marijuana or marijuana-related operations based on their illegality under federal law, noting that a contract for an illegal transaction is unenforceable. Thus, if we acquire a business or otherwise pursues a strategic alternative in the cannabis industry, we may have a difficult time obtaining certain insurances that are desired to operate our business, which may expose us to additional risks and financial liabilities.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and our Company Generally\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile, and your investment in our common stock could decline in value.\nThe stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of the securities of biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, particularly companies like ours without product revenues and earnings, have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcement of FDA approval or disapproval of our product candidates or other product-related actions;\n\u25cf developments involving our discovery efforts and clinical studies;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including announcements of infringement, interference or other litigation against us or our potential licensees;\n\u25cf announcements concerning our competitors, or the biotechnology, pharmaceutical or drug delivery industry in general;\n\u25cf public concerns as to the safety or efficacy of our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u25cf changes in government regulation of the pharmaceutical or medical industry;\n\u25cf changes in the reimbursement policies of third party insurance companies or government agencies;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf developments involving corporate collaborators, if any;\n\u25cf changes in accounting principles; and\n\u25cf the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities. Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock. The delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nOur common stock is listed on NASDAQ. In order to maintain our listing, we must meet minimum financial and other requirements, including requirements for a minimum amount of capital and a minimum price per share. We cannot assure you that we will continue to meet the continued listing requirements in the future.\nIf NASDAQ delists our common stock from trading on its exchange, due to failure to meet its continued listing requirements, and we are not able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity for our common stock;\n\u25cf a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf we sell shares of our common stock in future financings, stockholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current market price of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders would experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at such discount. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. If we issue common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into common stock, our common stockholders would experience additional dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ, the market for our shares has demonstrated varying levels of trading activity. There has been limited trading of our common stock in the U.S since we began trading on NASDAQ in January 2014. Furthermore, the current level of trading may not be sustained in the future. The lack of an active market for our common stock may impair investors\u2019 ability to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable, may reduce the fair market value of their shares and may impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire additional intellectual property assets by using our shares as consideration.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock and, accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and limitations under applicable law, and will depend on various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, future prospects and any other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. You should not rely on an investment in our company if you require dividend income from your investment in our company. The success of your investment will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation of the market price of our common stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales may occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, even if our business is doing well.\nSales by our stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur in the future. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue additional series of preferred stock that rank senior or equally to the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividend payments and liquidation preference.\nNeither our certificate of incorporation nor the Certificate of Designation for the Series C Preferred Stock prohibits us from issuing additional series of preferred stock that would rank senior or equally to the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividend payments and liquidation preference. Our certificate of incorporation provides that we have the authority to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no shares of which are outstanding prior to this offering. The issuances of other series of preferred stock could have the effect of reducing the amounts available to the Series C Preferred Stock in the event of our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution. It may also reduce cash dividend payments on the Series C Preferred Stock if we do not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on all Series C Preferred Stock outstanding and outstanding parity preferred stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 14419, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "AKER"}
