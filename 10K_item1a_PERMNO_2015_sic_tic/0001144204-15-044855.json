{"cik": "1086745", "company": "WPCS INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-07-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY\nOur Suisun Operations line of credit contains various covenants which, if not complied with, could accelerate our repayment obligations, thereby materially and adversely affecting our liquidity, financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe agreement governing our Suisun Operations\u2019 line of credit requires our Suisun Operations to comply with certain financial and operational covenants. These covenants require our Suisun Operations to, among other things, maintain a certain quick ratio and a minimum net worth. As of the filing date of this report, our Suisun Operations were in compliance with these covenants. However, our Suisun Operations\u2019 continued compliance with these covenants depends on many factors, and could be impacted by current or future economic conditions, and thus there are no assurances that our Suisun Operations will continue to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default that, if we were unable to obtain a waiver from the lender, could accelerate our repayment obligations under the line of credit and thereby have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions involve risks that could result in a reduction of our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe have made, and in the future may continue to make strategic acquisitions. However, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, or may be unable to obtain the consent of our shareholders and therefore, may not be able to complete such acquisitions. We may pay for acquisitions with our common stock or with convertible securities, which may dilute your investment in our common stock, or we may decide to pursue acquisitions that investors may not agree with. In connection with most of our acquisitions, we have also agreed to substantial earn-out arrangements. To the extent we defer the payment of the purchase price for any acquisition through a cash earn-out arrangement, it will reduce our cash flows in subsequent periods. In addition, acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including:\n\u00b7 the ability to profitably manage acquired businesses or successfully integrate the acquired business\u2019 operations and financial reporting and accounting control systems into our business;\n\u00b7 increased indebtedness and contingent purchase price obligations associated with an acquisition;\n\u00b7 the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions, or unforeseen internal difficulties;\n\u00b7 the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs;\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention; and\n\u00b7 the ability to retain or hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations.\nCompleting acquisitions may require significant management time and financial resources because we may need to assimilate widely dispersed operations with distinct corporate cultures. In addition, acquired companies may have liabilities that we failed, or were unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations. We cannot assure you that the indemnification granted to us by sellers of acquired companies will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with businesses or properties we assume upon consummation of an acquisition. We may learn additional information about our acquired businesses that materially adversely affect us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and liabilities related to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with, or resulting from, acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Borrowings or issuances of convertible securities associated with these acquisitions may also result in higher levels of indebtedness, which could impact our ability to service our debt within the scheduled repayment terms.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE CONTRACTING SERVICES BUSINESS\nIf we fail to accurately estimate costs associated with our fixed-price contracts using percentage-of-completion, our actual results could vary from our assumptions, which may reduce our profitability or impair our financial performance.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from fixed price contracts. Under these contracts, we set the price of our services on an aggregate basis and assume the risk that the costs associated with our performance may be greater than we anticipated. We recognize revenue and profit on these contracts as the work on these projects progresses on a percentage-of-completion basis. Under the percentage-of-completion method, contracts in process are valued at cost plus accrued profits less earned revenues and progress payments on uncompleted contracts.\nThe percentage-of-completion method therefore relies on estimates of total expected contract costs. These costs may be affected by a variety of factors, such as lower than anticipated productivity, conditions at work sites differing materially from what was anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and higher costs of materials and labor. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised monthly as the work progresses, such that adjustments to profit resulting from revisions are made cumulative to the date of the revision. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenue for the fiscal period affected by these revised estimates. If estimates of costs to complete long-term contracts indicate a loss, we immediately recognize the full amount of the estimated loss. Such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability and liquidity.\nFailure to properly manage projects could result in unanticipated costs or claims.\nOur project engagements may involve large scale, highly complex projects. The quality of our performance on such projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage the relationship with our customers, and to effectively manage the project and deploy appropriate resources, including third-party contractors and our own personnel, in a timely manner. Any defects or errors or failure to meet customers\u2019 expectations could result in claims for substantial damages against us. Our contracts generally limit our liability for damages that arise from negligent acts, errors, mistakes or omissions in rendering services to our customers. However, we cannot be sure that these contractual provisions will protect us from liability for damages in the event we are sued. In addition, in certain instances, we guarantee customers that we will complete a project by a scheduled date or that the network will achieve certain performance standards. If the project or network experiences a performance problem, we may not be able to recover the additional costs we would incur, which could exceed revenues realized from a project.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to undertake certain projects.\nSome of our contracts require performance and payment bonds. If we are not able to renew or obtain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, we may be precluded from being able to bid for certain contracts or successfully contract with certain customers. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds, we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with the bonds, which could negatively affect our cash flow.\nFurthermore, under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds. If we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or any other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that would require bonding.\nThe ability of our Suisun City Operations to obtain performance and payment bonds from traditional surety markets within the insurance industry has been adversely impacted by our operating losses and negative working capital at the consolidated Company level.\nAn economic downturn in any of the industries we serve could lead to less demand for our services.\nBecause the vast majority of our revenue is derived from a few industries, a downturn in any of those industries would adversely affect our results of operations. Specifically, an economic downturn in any industry we serve could result in the delay, reduction or cancellation of projects by our customers as well as cause our customers to outsource less work, resulting in decreased demand for our services and potentially impacting our operations and our ability to grow at historical levels. A number of other factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve or a prolonged economic downturn or recession, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future. Consolidation, competition, capital constraints or negative economic conditions in the private sector, public services, healthcare energy industries and the K-12 education market may also result in reduced spending by, or the loss of, one or more of our customers.\nWe have a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings assets.\nWe extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contracts prior to billing our customers for that work. At April 30, 2015, we had net accounts receivable of approximately $6,400,000 and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of approximately $420,000. We periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and continuously monitor the timeliness of payments. Slowdowns in the industries we serve may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. Further, bankruptcies or financial difficulties within the markets we serve could hinder the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis or at all, reducing our cash flows and adversely impacting our liquidity and profitability. Additionally, we could incur losses in excess of current bad debt allowances.\nThe industry in which we operate has relatively low barriers to entry and increased competition could result in margin erosion, which could make profitability even more difficult to sustain.\nOther than the technical skills required in our business, the barriers to entry in our business are relatively low. We do not have any intellectual property rights to protect our business methods and business start-up costs do not pose a significant barrier to entry. The success of our business is dependent on our employees, customer relations and the successful performance of our services. If we face increased competition as a result of new entrants in our markets, we could experience reduced operating margins and loss of market share and brand recognition.\nOur business depends upon our ability to keep pace with the latest technological changes, and our failure to do so could make us less competitive in our industry.\nThe market for our services is characterized by rapid change and technological improvements. Failure to respond in a timely and cost-effective way to these technological developments may result in serious harm to our business and operating results. We have derived, and we expect to continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenues from design-build services that are based upon today\u2019s leading technologies and that are capable of adapting to future technologies. As a result, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and market service offerings that respond in a timely manner to the technological advances of our customers, evolving industry standards and changing preferences.\nAmounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits.\nAs of April 30, 2015, we had a backlog of unfilled orders of approximately $14,100,000. This backlog amount is based on contract values and purchase orders and may not result in actual receipt of revenue in the originally anticipated period or at all. In addition, contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable. We have experienced variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from external market factors and economic factors beyond our control and we may experience delays or cancellations in the future. If our backlog fails to materialize, we could experience a further reduction in revenue, profitability and liquidity.\nEmployee strikes and other labor-related disruptions could adversely affect our operations.\nOur business is labor intensive. As of April 30, 2015, approximately 80% of our workforce was unionized, including 8% of our project managers. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages. Any of these events could be disruptive to our operations and could result in negative publicity, loss of contracts and a decrease in revenues.\nOur quarterly results fluctuate and could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and will likely fluctuate in the future. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indication of our future performance. A number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, are likely to cause these fluctuations. Some of these factors include:\n\u00b7 the timing and size of design-build projects and technology upgrades by our customers;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in demand for outsourced contracting services;\n\u00b7 the ability of certain customers to sustain capital resources to pay their trade account balances and required changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts based on periodic assessments of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances;\n\u00b7 reductions in the prices of services offered by our competitors;\n\u00b7 our success in bidding on and winning new business; and\n\u00b7 our sales, marketing and administrative cost structure.\nBecause our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and our common stock could decline significantly which may expose us to risks of securities litigation, impair our ability to attract and retain qualified individuals using equity incentives and make it more difficult to complete acquisitions using equity as consideration.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\nUntil the closing of the sale of our joint venture and profit interest, we will continue to conduct certain business in the PRC through our China Operations, which is organized under the laws of the PRC. Our China Operations are directly related to and dependent on the social, economic and political conditions in this country, all of which we have no control over, and are influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7 changes in the region\u2019s economic, social and political conditions or government policies;\n\u00b7 changes in trade laws, tariffs and other trade restrictions or licenses;\n\u00b7 changes in foreign exchange regulation in the PRC may limit our ability to freely convert currency to make dividends or other payments in U.S. dollars;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the value of RMB could adversely affect the value of our investment in the PRC;\n\u00b7 adverse changes in tax laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 difficulties in managing or overseeing our China Operations, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs; and\n\u00b7 different liability standards and less developed legal systems that may be less predictable than those in the United States.\nThe occurrence or consequences of any of these conditions may restrict our ability to operate and/or decrease the profitability of our China Operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nIf our common stock were delisted from The NASDAQ Stock Market, the Company would be subject to the risks relating to penny stocks.\nIf our common stock were to be delisted from trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market and the trading price of the common stock were below $5.00 per share on the date the common stock were delisted, trading in our common stock would also be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These rules require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a \"penny stock\" and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors, generally institutions. These additional requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in securities that are classified as penny stocks, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of such securities and the ability of purchasers to sell such securities in the secondary market. A penny stock is defined generally as any non-exchange listed equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in lawsuits against us and our officers and directors.\nThe stock market in general and the stock prices of technology and telecommunications companies in particular, have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future. Between May 1, 2014 and April 30, 2015, our common stock has traded as low as $2.78 and as high as $38.06 per share, based upon information provided by the NASDAQ Capital Market. Factors, which could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u00b7 announcements of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 the gain or loss of significant customers;\n\u00b7 changes in analysts\u2019 earnings estimates;\n\u00b7 rumors or dissemination of false information;\n\u00b7 pricing pressures;\n\u00b7 short selling of our common stock;\n\u00b7 impact of litigation;\n\u00b7 general conditions in the market;\n\u00b7 changing the exchange or quotation system on which we list our common stock for trading;\n\u00b7 announcements regarding acquisitions by or of our company;\n\u00b7 political and/or military events associated with current worldwide conflicts; and\n\u00b7 events affecting other companies that investors deem comparable to us.\nCompanies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have frequently been the objects of securities class action litigation. Class action and derivative lawsuits could result in substantial costs to us and cause a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe can issue shares of preferred stock without shareholder approval, which could adversely affect the rights of common shareholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation permits us to establish the rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions, including voting rights, of future series of our preferred stock and to issue such stock without approval from our stockholders. The rights of holders of our common stock may suffer as a result of the rights granted to holders of preferred stock that we may issue in the future. In addition, we could issue preferred stock to prevent a change in control of our company, depriving common shareholders of an opportunity to sell their stock at a price in excess of the prevailing market price.\nCertain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our Company more difficult.\nThe following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as currently in effect, as well as Delaware law, could discourage potential proposals to acquire us, delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock:\n\u00b7 our certificate of incorporation permits our Board of Directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our bylaws;\n\u00b7 our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7 our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to act by written consent; and\n\u00b7 we are subject to provisions of Delaware law which prohibit us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years following the date such stockholder became classified as an interested stockholder.", "PERMNO": 90640, "SIC": 7500, "TIC": "DCAR"}
