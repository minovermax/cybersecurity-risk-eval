RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as updated by other filings the Company makes with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us at this time or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMost of our business is conducted in Puerto Rico, which in recent years has experienced a deep economic recession and a downturn in the real estate market.\nBecause most of our business activities are conducted in Puerto Rico and a significant portion of our credit exposure on our loan portfolio, which is the largest component of our interest-earning assets, is concentrated in Puerto Rico, our profitability and financial condition may be adversely affected by an extended economic recession, adverse political, fiscal or economic developments in Puerto Rico or the effects of a natural disaster, all of which could result in a reduction in loan originations, an increase in non-performing assets, an increase in foreclosure losses on mortgage loans, and a reduction in the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio. The Puerto Rico economy has been in a recession since 2006.\nA period of reduced economic growth or a recession has historically resulted in a reduction in lending activity and an increase in the rate of default in commercial loans, consumer loans and residential mortgages. A recession may have a significant adverse impact on our net interest income and fee income. We may also experience significant losses on the loan portfolio due to a higher level of defaults on commercial loans, consumer loans and residential mortgages. For a discussion of the impact of the economy on our loan portfolios, see \u201c-A prolonged economic downturn or recession or a continuing decline in the real estate market would likely result in an increase in delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures and in a reduction in loan origination activity, which would adversely affect our financial results.\u201d\nThe prolonged recessionary economic environment accelerated the devaluation of properties and increased portfolio delinquency when compared with previous periods. Additional economic weakness in Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland could further pressure residential property values, loan delinquencies, foreclosures and the cost of repossessing and disposing of real estate collateral.\nWe are exposed to concentration risk in connection with loans to certain public corporations, instrumentalities and municipalities of Puerto Rico, and any credit default on their debt obligations could adversely affect the value of such loans.\nAlthough the economy of Puerto Rico is closely related to the economy of the rest of the United States, the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities face a number of economic and fiscal challenges that, either individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to pay debt-service on its obligations when due. Despite the Commonwealth\u2019s progress in addressing its persistent budget deficits and underfunded government retirement plans, the three main credit rating agencies have downgraded all debt obligations of the Puerto Rico government to categories that are well below investment grade. Generally, securities that are below investment grade present greater risks and are less liquid than investment-grade securities.\nThe downgrades are based mostly on concerns about Puerto Rico\u2019s economic recession, sizable debt-obligations, high unemployment, shrinking population, and the Puerto Rico government\u2019s lack of financial flexibility and reduced capacity to borrow in the capital markets, which increases the Commonwealth\u2019s risk of default. If the government is unable to access the capital markets to place new debt or refinance its upcoming maturities, the government may have to reduce spending, impose new taxes, and take emergency or extraordinary actions, which could slow the economy even further.\nIt is uncertain how capital markets may react to any future ratings downgrade in Puerto Rico government debt obligations. It is also uncertain whether the Puerto Rico government, including some of its public corporations, will be able to continue to service their respective debts as they become due. Any further deterioration of economic or fiscal conditions in Puerto Rico, with possible negative ratings implications, could adversely affect the value of our loans to the government of Puerto Rico and the value of our investment portfolio of Puerto Rico government bonds.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had approximately $619 million of credit facilities granted to the Puerto Rico government, including its instrumentalities, public corporations and municipalities, all of which was outstanding as of such date. A substantial portion of our credit exposure to the government of Puerto Rico consists of collateralized loans or obligations that have a specific source of income or revenues identified for their repayment. Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated loans to public corporations that obtain revenues from rates charged for services or products, such as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (\u201cPREPA\u201d) and the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewer Authority. Public corporations have varying degrees of independence from the central government and many have received appropriations or are due other payments from it.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had approximately $381 million of credit facilities granted to public corporations. Our banking subsidiary, Oriental Bank, is part of a four bank syndicate providing a $550 million dollar revolving line of credit to finance the purchase of fuel for the day-to-day power generation activities of PREPA. Our participation in the line of credit has an unpaid principal balance of $200 million as of December 31, 2014. We, as part of the bank syndicate, agreed in August 2014 to extend our credit facilities with PREPA to March 31, 2015. In connection with such extension, PREPA appointed a Chief Restructuring Officer to work alongside the Executive Director to develop, organize and manage a financial and operational restructuring of PREPA subject to the approval of PREPA\u2019s Board of Directors. PREPA also committed to deliver a full debt-restructuring plan by March 2, 2015. After the extension, we classified the credit as substandard and a troubled-debt restructuring due to several factors, including (i) our agreement to forbear from commencing any legal proceedings against PREPA or exercising any other remedies until March 31, 2015, and to permit monthly interest-only payments during the forbearance period with a principal payment due at maturity; and (ii) PREPA\u2019s weak liquidity position. We conducted an impairment analysis considering the probability of collection of principal and interest, which included a financial model to project the future liquidity status of PREPA under various scenarios and its capacity to service its financial obligations, and concluded that the loan should be maintained in accrual status requiring no impairment.\nOn December 15, 2014, pursuant to the requirements of the forbearance agreement, PREPA presented to its forbearing creditors a preliminary business plan focusing on its short to medium-term prospects and analyzing PREPA\u2019s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution and corporate services. The preliminary business plan includes PREPA\u2019s projections for operating and capital needs under various scenarios to establish a baseline for ongoing discussions.\nIn June 2014, Puerto Rico enacted the Puerto Rico Public Corporation Debt Enforcement and Recovery Act (the \u201cRecovery Act\u201d), which established procedures for the adjustment of debts of certain public corporations owned by the Commonwealth, which, as Puerto Rico governmental instrumentalities, are not currently eligible for federal bankruptcy relief under any chapter of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Recovery Act states in its preamble that it further promotes the government\u2019s public policy of no longer providing financial support to such public corporations, such as, for example, the PREPA, and promoting their economic independence. In February 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico held that the Recovery Act is preempted by the U.S Bankruptcy Code and is therefore void pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. It also permanently enjoined the Commonwealth from enforcing the Recovery Act. Although the Puerto Rico government has announced that it will appeal the district court\u2019s decision, the Commonwealth\u2019s current ability to restructure the debts of some of its public corporations, such as PREPA, remains uncertain, and a broad disorderly restructuring is possible.\nPREPA\u2019s enabling act provides for local receivership upon request to any Puerto Rico court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a default in debt-service payments or other obligations in connection with PREPA\u2019s bonds. The receiver so appointed would be empowered, directly or through its agents and attorneys, to take possession of the undertakings, income and revenues pledged to the payment of the bonds in default; to have, hold, use, operate, manage and control the same; and to exercise all of PREPA\u2019s rights and powers with respect to such undertakings. However, any such receiver would not have the power to sell, assign, mortgage or otherwise dispose of PREPA\u2019s assets, and its powers would be limited to the operation and maintenance of such undertakings and the collection and application of the income and revenues therefrom. These provisions have not been tested in the courts, and it is not clear if and how they would apply in connection with other debts and obligations of PREPA upon an event of default.\nIf our public corporation debtors are unable to pay their obligations as they become due, or under certain other circumstances, the we may be required to adversely classify such loans and provision for losses in connection therewith. Such provision may significantly impact our financial condition and our regulatory capital ratios.\nOur decisions regarding credit risk and the allowance for loan and lease losses may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nMaking loans is an essential element of our business, and there is a risk that the loans will not be repaid. This default risk is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the duration of the loan;\n\u00b7 credit risks of a particular borrower;\n\u00b7 changes in economic or industry conditions; and\n\u00b7 in the case of a collateralized loan, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral.\nWe strive to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We periodically determine the amount of the allowance based on consideration of several factors such as default frequency, internal risk ratings, expected future cash collections, loss recovery rates and general economic factors, among others. Our methodology for measuring the adequacy of the allowance relies on several key elements, which include a specific allowance for identified problem loans, a general systematic allowance, and an unallocated allowance.\nWe believe our allowance for loan and lease losses is currently sufficient given the constant monitoring of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio. However, there is no precise method of predicting loan losses and therefore we always face the risk that charge-offs in future periods will exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses and that additional increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses will be required. In addition, the FDIC as well as the OCFI may require us to establish additional reserves. Additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses would result in a decrease of net earnings and capital, and could hinder our ability to pay dividends.\nGiven the economic conditions in Puerto Rico, we may continue to experience increased credit costs or need to take greater than anticipated markdowns and make greater than anticipated provisions to increase the allowances for loan losses on the loans acquired that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nLoans that we acquired in the FDIC-assisted acquisition of Eurobank may not be covered by the shared-loss agreements if the FDIC determines that we have not adequately performed under these agreements or if the shared-loss agreements have ended.\nAlthough the FDIC has agreed to reimburse us for 80% of qualifying losses on covered loans by the shared-loss agreements, we are not protected from all losses resulting from charge-offs with respect to such loans. Also, the FDIC has the right to refuse or delay payment for loan and lease losses if the shared-loss agreements are not performed by us in accordance with their terms. Additionally, the shared-loss agreements have limited terms, and therefore, any charge-offs that we experience after the terms of the shared-loss agreements have ended would not be recoverable from the FDIC.\nDuring 2015, the shared-loss agreement for non-single family loans will expire. As a result, non-single family covered loans will face an increased risk-weight impact from 20% to 100% or 150%, if delinquent, for regulatory capital purposes. This could impact some of our asset quality ratios, the premium paid for the FDIC insurance and regulatory capital requirements. In addition, there will be no mirror accounting for reimbursable expenses and credit losses, causing us to assume 100% responsibility for expenses and credit losses incurred by these loans; however, this impact can be offset by the decrease in the indemnification asset amortization.\nCertain provisions of the shared-loss agreements entered into with the FDIC may have anti-takeover effects and could limit our ability to engage in certain strategic transactions that our board of directors believes would be in the best interests of shareholders.\nThe FDIC\u2019s agreement to bear 80% of qualifying losses on single family residential loans for ten years and commercial loans for five years is one of our significant assets and a feature of the FDIC-assisted acquisition without which we would not have entered into such transaction. Our agreement with the FDIC requires that we receive prior FDIC consent, which may be withheld by the FDIC in its sole discretion, prior to us or our shareholders engaging in certain transactions. If any such transaction is completed without prior FDIC consent, the FDIC would have the right to discontinue the loss-sharing arrangement.\nAmong other things, prior FDIC consent is required for: (i) a merger or consolidation of us with or into another company if our shareholders will own less than 2/3 of the combined company and (ii) a sale of shares by one or more of our shareholders that will effect a change in control of Oriental Bank, as determined by the FDIC with reference to the standards set forth in the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978 (generally, the acquisition of between 10% and 25% of our voting securities where the presumption of control is not rebutted, or the acquisition of more than 25% of our voting securities). Such a sale by shareholders may occur beyond our control. If we or any shareholder desires to enter into any such transaction, there can be no assurances that the FDIC would grant its consent in a timely manner, without conditions, or at all. If one of these transactions were to occur without prior FDIC consent and the FDIC withdrew its loss-share protection, there could be a material adverse impact on us.\nLoans that we acquired in the FDIC-assisted acquisition may be subject to impairment.\nAlthough the covered loan portfolios acquired by us were initially accounted for at fair value, certain of such loans have become impaired and as of December 31, 2014 we have recorded $64.2 million in allowance for loan losses related to this portfolio. There is no assurance that loans in this portfolio will not become impaired or further impaired, which may result in additional provision for loan and lease losses related to these portfolios. The fluctuations in economic conditions, including those related to the Puerto Rico residential and commercial real estate and construction markets may increase the level of provision for credit losses that we make to our loan portfolio and portfolios acquired in the FDIC-assisted acquisition, and consequently, reduce our net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled, and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition even if other favorable events occur.\nOur earnings could decrease due to increases to the provision for credit losses\nOur customers might not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans might be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. Hence, we may experience significant loan losses, which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on loan quality reviews, past loss experience, and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.\nOur emphasis on the origination of commercial real estate and business loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating our allowance for loan losses. As we continue to increase the amount of these loans, additional or increased provisions for credit losses may be necessary and as a result would decrease our earnings.\nBank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe are subject to default and other risks in connection with mortgage loan originations.\nFrom the time that we fund the mortgage loans originated to the time that they are sold, we are generally at risk for any mortgage loan defaults. Once we sell the mortgage loans, the risk of loss from mortgage loan defaults and foreclosures passes to the purchaser or insurer of the mortgage loans. However, in the ordinary course of business, we make representations and warranties to the purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans relating to the validity of such loans. If there is a breach of any of these representations or warranties, we may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss on the mortgage loan. We also may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event that there was improper underwriting or fraud or in the event that the loans become delinquent shortly after they are originated. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we repurchased $17.8 million of loans from GNMA and FNMA. Any such repurchases in the future may negatively impact our liquidity and operating results. Termination of our ability to sell mortgage products to the U.S government-sponsored entities would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur in the event of breaches of representations and warranties and in various other circumstances, including securities fraud claims, and the amount of such losses could exceed the purchase amount of the related loans. Consequently, we may be exposed to credit risk associated with sold loans. In addition, we incur higher liquidity risk with respect to mortgage loans not eligible to be purchased or insured by FNMA, GNMA or FHLMC, due to a lack of secondary market in which to sell these loans.\nWe have established reserves in our consolidated financial statements for potential losses that are considered to be both probable and reasonably estimable related to the mortgage loans sold by us. The adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred will depend on, among other things, the actual future mortgage loan performance, the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests, the actual success rate of claimants, developments in litigation related to us and the industry, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). Due to uncertainties relating to these factors, there can be no assurance that our reserves will be adequate or that the total amount of losses incurred will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. For additional information related to our allowance for loan and lease losses, see \u201cNote 6-Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nA prolonged economic downturn or recession or a continuing decline in the real estate market would likely result in an increase in delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures and in a reduction in loan origination activity, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nThe residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoying periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of lower volumes and industry-wide losses. The market for residential mortgage loan originations is currently in decline, and this trend could also reduce the level of mortgage loans that we may originate in the future and may adversely impact our business. During periods of rising interest rates, refinancing originations for many mortgage products tend to decrease as the economic incentives for borrowers to refinance their existing mortgage loans are reduced. In addition, the residential mortgage loan origination business is impacted by home values. A significant trend of decreasing values in certain housing segments in Puerto Rico has also been noted. There is a risk that a reduction in housing values could negatively impact our loss levels on the mortgage portfolio because the value of the homes underlying the loans is a primary source of repayment in the event of foreclosure.\nThe decline in Puerto Rico\u2019s economy has had an adverse effect in the credit quality of our loan portfolios. Among other things, during the ongoing recession, we have experienced an increase in the level of non-performing assets and loan loss provision, which adversely affected our profitability. Although the delinquency rates have decreased recently, they may increase if the recession continues or worsen. If there is another decline in economic activity, additional increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses could be necessary with further adverse effects on our profitability.\nAny sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could harm our ability to sell loans, the price received on the sale of such loans, and the value of the mortgage loan portfolio, all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any material decline in real estate values would weaken our collateral loan-to-value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower defaults. For a discussion of the impact of the Puerto Rico economy on our business operations, see \u201cMost of our business is conducted in Puerto Rico, which in recent years has experienced a deep economic recession and downturn in the real estate market.\u201d\nWe could incur increased costs or reductions in revenue or suffer reputational damage in the event of misuse of information.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks regarding our customers and their accounts. To provide these products and services, we use information systems and infrastructure that we and third party service providers operate. As a financial institution, we also are subject to and examined for compliance with an array of data protection laws, regulations and guidance, as well as to our own internal privacy and information security policies and programs.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions like us have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers and other external parties. Our technologies and systems may become the target of cyber-attacks or other attacks that could result in the misuse or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary or other information or that could result in disruptions to our business operations or those of customers or other third parties. Further, a breach or attack affecting one of our third-party service providers or partners could impact us through no fault of our own. In addition, because the methods and techniques employed by perpetrators of fraud and others to attack systems and applications change frequently and often are not fully recognized or understood until after they have been launched, we and our third-party service providers and partners may be unable to anticipate certain attack methods in order to implement effective preventative measures.\nWhile we have policies and procedures designated to prevent or limit the effect of the possible security breach of our information systems, if unauthorized persons were somehow to get access to confidential or proprietary information in our possession or to our proprietary information, it could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems that could adversely affect our business. Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.\nWe are exposed to risks related to cyber-security and cyber incidents\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks regarding our customers and their accounts. To provide these products and services, we use information systems and infrastructure that we and third party service providers operate. As a financial institution, we also are subject to and examined for compliance with an array of data protection laws, regulations and guidance, as well as to our own internal privacy and information security policies and programs.\nSuch incidents may include unauthorized access to our digital systems for purposes of misappropriation of assets, gaining access to sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Although our information technology structure continue to be subject to cyber attacks, we have not experience a breach of cyber-security. Such an event could compromise our confidential information as well as that of our customers and third parties with whom we interact with and may result in negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenues, additional regulatory scrutiny, litigation and reputational damage. Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.\nWe rely on the services of third parties for our banking, information technology, telecommunications, and mortgage loan servicing infrastructure, and any failure, interruption or termination of such services or systems could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business relies on the secure, successful and uninterrupted functioning of our banking, information technology, telecommunications, and mortgage loan servicing infrastructure. We outsource some of our major systems, such as customer data and deposit processing, mortgage loan servicing, Internet and mobile banking, and electronic fund transfer systems. The failure or interruption of such systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or mortgage servicing, or any service agreement on which any of these systems or services is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such systems fail or experience interruptions.\nWe periodically sell or securitize our mortgage loans while retaining the obligation to perform the servicing of such loans. Although we are the master servicer of our mortgage loan portfolios, we outsource our servicing functions pursuant to a subservicing arrangement with a third party in Puerto Rico. The termination or interruption of such subservicing arrangement, without a feasible substitute or successor, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because the FDIC has the right to refuse or delay payment for loan and lease losses if the shared-loss agreements are not performed by us in accordance with their terms, any such termination or interruption of the subservicing of the covered loans that we acquired in the FDIC-assisted acquisition could adversely affect our ability to comply with such terms.\nIf sustained or repeated, a failure, denial or termination of such systems or services could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new loans, service existing loans, gather deposits and/or provide customer service. It could also compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial results are constantly exposed to market risk, in particular to changes in interest rates.\nMarket risk refers to the probability of variations in the net interest income or the fair value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates or equity prices.\nChanges in interest rates are one of the principal market risks affecting us. Our income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is the difference between the revenue\ngenerated on interest-earning assets and the interest cost of funding those assets. Depending on the duration and repricing characteristics of the assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, changes in interest rates could either increase or decrease the level of net interest income. For any given period, the pricing structure of the assets and liabilities is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities mature or reprice in that period.\nWe use an asset-liability management software program to project future movements in the balance sheet and income statement. The starting point of the projections generally corresponds to the actual values of the balance sheet on the date of the simulations. These simulations are highly complex and use many simplifying assumptions. In addition, the interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the prepayment speed of loans, the value of loans and investment securities, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk because of the following factors:\n\u00b7 Assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. For example, if assets reprice slower than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising, earnings may initially decline.\n\u00b7 Assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts. For example, when the general level of interest rates is rising, we may increase rates charged on loans by an amount that is less than the general increase in market interest rates because of intense pricing competition. Also, basis risk occurs when assets and liabilities have similar repricing frequencies but are tied to different market interest rate indices that may not move in tandem.\n\u00b7 Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts, i.e., the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs differently.\n\u00b7 The remaining maturity of various assets and liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if long-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply, our mortgage-backed securities portfolios may prepay significantly earlier than anticipated, which could reduce portfolio income. If prepayment rates increase, we would be required to amortize net premiums into income over a shorter period of time, thereby reducing the corresponding asset yield and net interest income. Prepayment risk also has a significant impact on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations since prepayments could shorten the weighted average life of these portfolios.\n\u00b7 Interest rates may have an indirect impact on loan demand, credit losses, loan origination volume, the value of financial assets and financial liabilities, gains and losses on sales of securities and loans, the value of mortgage servicing rights and other sources of earnings.\nIn limiting interest rate risk to an acceptable level, management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities, change pricing schedules, adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities, and enter into derivative contracts, among other alternatives. We may suffer losses or experience lower spreads than anticipated in initial projections as management implements strategies to reduce future interest rate exposure.\nThe hedging transactions that we enter into may not be effective in managing our exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk.\nWe use over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and options on interest rate swaps, to manage part of our exposure to market risk caused by changes in interest rates. We have also offered certificates of deposit with an option tied to the performance of the Standard & Poor 500 stock market index and use derivatives, such as option agreements with major broker-dealer companies, to manage our exposure to changes in the value of the index. The OTC derivative instruments that we may utilize also have their own risks, which include: (i) basis risk, which is the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost; (ii) credit or default risk, which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder; and (iii) legal risk, which is the risk that we are unable to enforce certain terms of such instruments. All or any of such risks could expose us to losses. Further, as a result of the new regulatory regime for OTC derivatives enacted under the Dodd-Frank Act, and the regulations issued thereunder by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, we are subject to additional reporting, recordkeeping and other requirements in connection with our use of OTC derivatives.\nIf the counterparty to an OTC derivative contract fails to perform, our credit risk is equal to the net fair value of the contract. We deal with counterparties that have high quality credit ratings at the time we enter into the counterparty relationships. However, there can be no assurances that the counterparties will have the ability to perform under their contracts. If the counterparty fails to perform, including as a result of the bankruptcy or insolvency of such counterparty, we would incur losses as a result.\nWe may incur a significant impairment charge in connection with a decline in the market value of our investment securities portfolio.\nPart of our earnings comes from the treasury business segment, which encompasses the investment securities portfolio. The determination of fair value for investment securities involves significant judgment due to the complexity of factors contributing to the valuation, many of which are not readily observable in the market. In addition, we utilize and review information obtained from third-party sources to measure fair values. Third-party sources also use assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining securities values, and different third parties may provide different prices for securities. Moreover, depending upon, among other things, the measurement date of the security, the subsequent sale price of the security may be different from its recorded fair value. These differences may be significant, especially if the security is sold during a period of illiquidity or market disruption.\nWhen the fair value of a security declines, management must assess whether the decline is \u201cother-than-temporary.\u201d When the decline in fair value is deemed \u201cother-than-temporary,\u201d the amortized cost basis of the investment security is reduced to its then current fair value. The term \u201cother-than-temporary impairment\u201d is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospect for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. Any portion of a decline in value associated with credit loss is recognized in income with the remaining noncredit-related component being recognized in other comprehensive income. A credit loss is determined by assessing whether the amortized cost basis of the security will be recovered, by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security, computed using original yield as the discount rate, to the amortized cost basis of the security. The shortfall of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected in relation to the amortized cost basis is considered to be the \u201ccredit loss.\u201d Such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition. Subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future results of operations, as they are based on the difference between the sale prices received and the adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. We consider numerous factors in our review of whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, many of which involve complex judgment.\nA decline in the market value of our investment securities portfolio could adversely impact our regulatory capital ratios.\nUnder the new capital rules adopted by the federal banking regulatory agencies to implement the so-called \u201cBasel III\u201d capital framework in the United States, banking organizations will generally be required to include gains and losses on their securities holdings classified as available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) in common equity tier 1 capital (\u201cCET1\u201d). This aspect of the rules will be phased in over several years with full gain and loss flow-through to capital starting in 2018. Currently, unrealized losses on AFS equity securities are counted against Tier 1 Capital, unrealized gains on AFS equity securities are partially included in Tier 2 Capital and unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt securities are excluded from regulatory capital. However, these unrealized gains and losses are reflected in stockholders\u2019 equity under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). As part of the new capital rules, the agencies introduced the concept of CET1, which is comprised of qualifying common stock instruments, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d), certain qualifying minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries and other adjustments, and establish a new minimum ratio of CET1 to total risk-weighted assets of 4.5% beginning in 2015 and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% to be phased in over several years through 2018. Because of the inclusion of AOCI, unlike the current general risk-based capital rules, unrealized gains and losses on all AFS-classified securities would flow through to CET1 capital, after the transition period.\nHowever, under the new capital rules, a banking organization, such as us, that is not subject to the advanced approaches rule may make a one-time election not to include most elements of AOCI in regulatory capital and instead effectively use the existing treatment under general risk-based capital rules that excludes most AOCI elements from regulatory capital. Any such banking organization must make its AOCI opt-out election in its first Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) or FR Y-9 series report that is filed after it becomes subject to the new rules. If we do not make a timely AOCI opt-out election, we will be required to recognize AOCI (excluding accumulated net gains and losses on cash-flow hedges that relate to the hedging of items that are not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet) in regulatory capital as of the first quarter of 2015 and continuing thereafter. In such case, our CET1 levels would likely be significantly more volatile under the new capital rules than previously because unrealized gains and losses on AFS classified securities recognized in stockholders\u2019 equity on the balance sheet for accounting purposes would also be incorporated for regulatory capital purposes. Accordingly, a decline in the market value of our investment securities portfolio could adversely impact our regulatory capital ratios.\nMarket conditions and actions by governmental authorities may upset the historical relationship between interest rate changes and prepayment trends, which would make it more difficult for us to analyze our investment portfolio.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to analyze the relationship of changing interest rates on prepayments of the mortgage loans that underlie our mortgage-backed securities (\u201cMBS\u201d) portfolio. Changes in interest rates and prepayments affect the market price of MBS that we may purchase and any MBS that we may hold at a given time. As part of our overall portfolio risk management, we analyze interest rate changes and prepayment trends separately and collectively to assess their effects on our investment portfolio. In conducting this analysis, we depend on certain assumptions based upon historical trends with respect to the relationship between interest rates and prepayments under normal market conditions. U.S. government programs aimed at assisting homeowners, including the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan, the Home Affordable Refinancing Program (\u201cHARP\u201d), and the Home Affordable Modification Program (\u201cHAMP\u201d), could cause an increase in prepayment rates. If the dislocations in the residential mortgage market, recent or future government actions, or other developments change the way that prepayment trends have historically responded to interest rate changes, it would significantly affect our ability to (i) assess the market value of our investment portfolio, (ii) implement our hedging strategies, and (iii) adopt techniques to reduce our prepayment rate volatility. This could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we cannot maintain access to stable funding sources.\nOur business requires continuous access to various funding sources. We are able to fund our operations through deposits as well as through advances from the FHLB-NY and other alternative sources; however, our business is significantly dependent upon other wholesale funding sources, such as repurchase agreements and brokered deposits, which consisted of approximately 25.2% of our total interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2014.\nBrokered deposits are typically sold through an intermediary to small retail investors. Our ability to continue to attract brokered deposits is subject to variability based upon a number of factors, including volume and volatility in the global securities markets, our credit rating and the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these liabilities. Brokered deposits are generally considered a less stable source of funding than core deposits obtained through retail bank branches. Investors in brokered deposits are generally more sensitive to interest rates and will generally move funds from one depository institution to another based on small differences in interest rates offered on deposits.\nWe expect to have continued access to credit from the foregoing sources of funds. However, there can be no assurance that such financing sources will continue to be available or will be available on favorable terms. In a period of financial disruption, or if negative developments occur with respect to us, the availability and cost of funding sources could be adversely affected. In that event, our cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing the net interest income, or we may need to dispose of a portion of the investment portfolio, which, depending upon market conditions, could result in realizing a loss or experiencing other adverse accounting consequences upon the dispositions. The interest rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by, among other things, applicable credit ratings from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to any of these credit ratings could affect our ability to access the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful to deal with dramatic or unanticipated changes in the global securities markets or other reductions in liquidity driven by us or market related events. In the event that such sources of funds are reduced or eliminated and we are not able to replace them on a cost-effective basis, we may be forced to curtail or cease our loan origination business and treasury activities, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur risk management policies, procedures and systems may be inadequate to mitigate all risks inherent in our various businesses.\nA comprehensive risk management function is essential to the financial and operational success of our business. The types of risk we monitor and seek to manage include, but are not limited to, operational risk, technological and organizational risk, market risk, fiduciary risk, legal and compliance risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. We have adopted various policies, procedures and systems to monitor and manage these risks. There can be no assurance that those policies, procedures and systems are adequate to identify and mitigate all risks inherent in our various businesses. Our businesses and the markets in which we operate are also continuously evolving. If we fail to fully understand the implications of changes in our business or the financial markets and to adequately or timely enhance the risk framework to address those changes, we could incur losses. In addition, in a difficult or less liquid market environment, our risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for us to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants.\nCompetition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits and assets to manage. The competition in originating loans and attracting assets comes principally from other U.S., Puerto Rico and foreign banks, investment advisors, securities broker-dealers, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance companies, and other institutional lenders and purchasers of loans. We will encounter greater competition as we expand our operations. Increased competition may require us to increase the rates paid on deposits or lower the rates charged on loans which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and local laws and regulations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act has a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes, as discussed in the Item 1. Business section.\nGiven that many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are being implemented over time and are subject to implementing regulations, the full extent of the impact that such requirements, and other legislative and regulatory developments, will have on our operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. In particular, the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our operations and activities, both currently and prospectively, include, among others:\n\u00b7 a reduction in our ability to generate or originate revenue-producing assets as a result of compliance with heightened capital standards;\n\u00b7 increased cost of operations due to greater regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks and bank holding companies, and higher deposit insurance premiums;\n\u00b7 the limitation on our ability to raise capital through the use of trust preferred securities as these securities will no longer be included as tier 1 capital going forward; and\n\u00b7 the limitation on our ability to expand consumer product and service offerings due to anticipated stricter consumer protection laws and regulations.\nFurther, we may be required to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to our investors.\nLegislative and other measures that may be taken by Puerto Rico governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIt is expected that during the first quarter of 2015, a new comprehensive tax reform is implemented in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Among others, it is expected that the additional tax on gross income (Patente Nacional) is repealed and the maximum corporate income tax rate is reduced. In addition, it is expected that a broad based value added tax (VAT) is implemented replacing the current sales and use tax (SUT) of 7% and the rate of this new tax is estimated to be significantly higher.\nAlso, we operate the IBE Unit and Subsidiary pursuant to the IBE Act that provide us with significant tax advantages. An IBE has the benefits of exemptions from Puerto Rico income taxes on interest earned on, or gain realized from the sale of, non-Puerto Rico assets, including U.S. government obligations and certain mortgage-backed securities. This exemption has allowed us to have effective tax rates significantly below the maximum statutory tax rates. In the past, the Legislature of Puerto Rico has considered proposals to curb the tax benefits afforded to IBEs. In 2012, a new Puerto Rico law was enacted in this area. Although it did not repeal the IBE Act, the new law does not allow new license applications under the IBE Act to organize and operate an IBE. Any newly organized entity (now called an \u201cinternational financial entity\u201d) must be licensed under the new law and such entity (as opposed to existing IBEs organized under the IBE Act, including the Bank\u2019s IBE Unit and Subsidiary, which are \u201cgrandfathered\u201d) will generally be subject to a 4% Puerto Rico income tax rate. In the event other legislation is passed in Puerto Rico to eliminate or modify the tax exemption enjoyed by IBEs, the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on us, including increasing the tax burden or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur intangible assets could be determined to be impaired in the future and could decrease the Company\u2019s earnings\nWe are required to test our goodwill, core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of our common shares, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities, and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our common shares or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly restrict the Company\u2019s ability to make dividend payments without prior regulatory approval.\nOur ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries. Dividends to us from our subsidiaries have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock, make payments on corporate debt securities and meet other obligations. There are various U.S. federal and Puerto Rico law limitations on the extent to which Oriental Bank, our main subsidiary, can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans. These limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements, U.S. federal and Puerto Rico banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Board governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. Further, under the new capital rules adopted by the federal banking regulatory agencies, a banking organization will need to hold a capital conservation buffer (composed of common equity tier 1 capital) greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Compliance with the capital conservation buffer is determined as of the end of the calendar quarter prior to any such capital distribution or discretionary bonus payment, and is subject to a three-year transition period beginning in 2016.\nIf our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments while maintaining adequate capital levels, our liquidity may be affected, and we may not be able to make dividend payments to our holders of common and preferred stock or payments on outstanding corporate debt securities or meet other obligations, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or perception of financial health.\nIn addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by FASB. Market conditions have prompted accounting standard setters to promulgate new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments, structures or transactions as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. See \u201cNote 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of any accounting developments that have been issued but not yet implemented. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, the effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that applies to the consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition in attracting talented people could adversely affect our operations.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and we rely heavily on our management team. The inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key managers may adversely affect our operations. Our success to date has been influenced strongly by the ability to attract and retain senior management experienced in banking and financial services. Retention of senior managers and appropriate succession planning will continue to be critical to the successful implementation of our strategies.\nReputational risk and social factors may impact our results.\nOur ability to originate loans and to attract deposits and assets is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer, commercial and funding markets of our business practices and our financial health. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including lending practices, regulatory compliance, inadequate protection of customer information, or sales and marketing, and from actions taken by regulators in response to such conduct. Adverse perceptions regarding us could lead to difficulties in originating loans and generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them.\nIn addition, a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity, including credit card use, payment patterns and the rate of defaults by account holders and borrowers. If consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt, or if consumption trends decline, our business and financial results will be negatively affected.", "PERMNO": 11208, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "OFG"}
