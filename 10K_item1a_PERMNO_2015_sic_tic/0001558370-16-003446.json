{"cik": "1124140", "company": "EXACT SCIENCES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. This discussion highlights some of the risks that may affect future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider. We cannot be certain that we will successfully address these risks. If we are unable to address these risks, our business may not grow, our stock price may suffer and we may be unable to stay in business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations.\nWe may never become profitable.\nWe have incurred losses since we were formed and have only recently begun generating revenue from Cologuard, our only product. From our date of inception on February 10, 1995 through December 31, 2015, we have accumulated a total deficit of approximately $578.6 million. We expect that our losses will continue for at least the next several years and that we will be required to invest significant additional funds toward development and commercialization of our colorectal cancer screening technology and other products and services. If our revenue does not grow significantly, we will not be profitable. We cannot be certain that the revenue from the sale of any products or services based on our technologies will be sufficient to make us profitable.\nWe may need additional capital to execute our business plan.\nAlthough we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months, we may require additional capital to fully fund our current strategic plan, which includes successfully commercializing Cologuard and developing a pipeline of future products. Additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms satisfactory to us or at all. General market conditions, the market price of our common stock, our financial condition, uncertainty about the future commercial success of Cologuard or the development commercial success of future products, regulatory developments, the status and scope of our intellectual property, any ongoing litigation and other factors may significantly affect our success in raising additional capital. If we raise additional funds through the sale of equity, convertible debt or other equity-linked securities, our stockholders\u2019 ownership will be diluted. We may issue securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, licensing arrangements or other structured financing transactions, we may relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products, grant security interests in our assets or grant licenses to third parties on terms that are unfavorable to us.\nOur success depends heavily on our Cologuard colorectal cancer screening test.\nFor the foreseeable future, our ability to generate revenues will depend entirely on the commercial success of our Cologuard test. The commercial success of our Cologuard test and our ability to generate revenues will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nacceptance in the medical community;\n\u00b7\ninclusion of Cologuard in healthcare guidelines, such as those developed by ACS and USPSTF;\n\u00b7\ninclusion of Cologuard in quality measures including Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (\u201cHEDIS\u201d\u2019) and the CMS Star ratings;\n\u00b7\nrecommendations and studies regarding colorectal cancer screening that may be published by government agencies, professional organizations, academic or medical journals other key opinion leaders;\n\u00b7\npatient acceptance of and demand for the Cologuard test;\n\u00b7\nsuccessful sales, marketing and educational programs;\n\u00b7\nthe number of patients tested for colorectal cancer as well as the number of patients who use Cologuard for that purpose;\n\u00b7\nsufficient coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and nature of competition from other colorectal cancer or pre-cancer screening products and procedures;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining FDA marketing approval of Cologuard in the United States and the receipt and maintenance of marketing approval from foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nobtaining regulatory approvals and appropriate payor coverage to successfully market Cologuard in foreign markets including Europe, East Asia and Australia;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining and defending patent protection for the intellectual property relevant to Cologuard; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish and maintain commercial manufacturing, distribution, sales force and CLIA laboratory testing capabilities.\nIf we are unable to develop substantial sales of our Cologuard test or if we are significantly delayed or limited in doing so, our business prospects would be adversely affected.\nOur quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and cause losses to our stockholders.\nOur revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly, depending on a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nour success in marketing and selling, and changes in demand for, our Cologuard test, and the level of reimbursement and collection obtained for Cologuard;\n\u00b7\nseasonal variations affecting physician recommendations for colorectal cancer screenings and patient compliance with physician recommendations;\n\u00b7\nour success in collecting payments from third-party payors, customers and collaborative partners, variation in the timing of these payments and recognition of these payments as revenues;\n\u00b7\nthe pricing of our Cologuard test, including potential changes in CMS or other reimbursement rates;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the amount and timing of our selling and marketing costs and our ability to manage costs and expenses and effectively implement our business;\n\u00b7\nour research and development activities, including our ability to develop new and improved tests and the timing of expensive clinical trials; and\nOther companies or institutions may develop and market novel or improved methods for detecting colorectal cancer or pre-cancer, which may make our technologies less competitive or obsolete.\nThe market for colorectal cancer and pre-cancer screening is large, consisting of more than 80 million Americans age 50 and above. As a result, this market has attracted competitors, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than we do. Some companies and institutions are developing serum-based tests and screening tests based on the detection of proteins, nucleic acids or the presence of fragments of mutated genes in the blood that are produced by colorectal cancer or pre-cancer. We are aware of at least five companies - Epigenomics AG, Applied Proteomics, Inc., Gene News, EDP Biotech Corporation and Quest Diagnostics - that are developing blood-based tests for the detection of colorectal cancer. Epigenomics AG completed a large multi-center study designed to demonstrate the performance of its blood-based screening test for colorectal cancer and submitted the results to the FDA in June 2014. On January 8, 2016, Epigenomics AG announced that the FDA had informed it that the clinical data that it had submitted regarding its blood-based screening test is sufficient for the FDA to make a final decision on premarket approval and that the FDA\u2019s review process will be completed in the near future. On January 10, 2016, Illumina, Inc. announced the formation of GRAIL, a new company formed to develop a blood-based, pan-cancer screening test that would seek to measure circulating nucleic acids in blood using next-generation sequencing (\u201cNGS\u201d) technology. We believe other companies are also working on so-called \u201cliquid biopsy\u201d tests using NGS technology, and these tests could represent significant competition for Cologuard and other tests we may develop. Our Cologuard test also faces competition from procedure-based detection technologies such as flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy and \u201cvirtual\u201d colonoscopy (a radiological imaging approach that visualizes the inside of the bowel by use of spiral computerized axial tomography known as a CT scan) as well as traditional screening tests such as FOBT and FIT and newer screening technologies such as the PillCam COLON cleared by FDA in February 2014. Our competitors may also be working on additional methods of detecting colorectal cancer and pre-cancer that have not yet been announced.\nBeyond our Cologuard test, as we seek to develop other tools to detect cancer and pre-cancer, we expect to compete with a broad range of organizations in the U.S. and other countries that are engaged in the development, production and commercialization of cancer diagnostic tools. These competitors include:\n\u00b7\nbiotechnology, diagnostic and other life science companies;\n\u00b7\nacademic and scientific institutions;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental agencies; and\n\u00b7\npublic and private research organizations.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors either because their products and services are superior or because they may have more expertise, experience, financial resources or stronger business relationships. Our competitors may have broader product lines and greater name recognition than we do. We have limited experience developing tests for the detection of non-colorectal cancers and we cannot guarantee that our research and development activities will be successful in developing any marketable testing products or services. Further, even if we do develop new marketable products or services, our current and future competitors may develop products and services that are more commercially attractive than ours and they may obtain FDA approval or clearance, and bring those products and services to market, sooner than we are able to.\nWe face uncertainty related to healthcare reform, pricing, coverage and reimbursement, which could reduce our revenue.\nRecent healthcare reform laws, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (\u201cPAMA\u201d), are significantly affecting the U.S. healthcare and medical services industry. Existing legislation, and possible future legal and regulatory changes, could substantially change the structure\nand finances of the health insurance system and the methodology for reimbursing medical services, drugs and devices, including our current and future products and services. Any change in reimbursement policy could result in a change in patient co-payments, which could adversely affect patient willingness and ability to use our Cologuard test and any other product or service we may develop. Healthcare reforms, which may intend to reduce healthcare costs, may have the effect of discouraging third-party payors from covering certain kinds of medical products and services, particularly newly developed technologies, such as our Cologuard test.\nEven without further legislative reform, there can be no assurance that CMS will maintain its current coverage and reimbursement rate for our Cologuard test. If the CMS reimbursement rate for Cologuard is reduced, our revenues could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that CMS and commercial payors who initially decide to cover Cologuard will continue to cover Cologuard. Groups with varying interests may lobby CMS to reduce or terminate reimbursement for Cologuard. For example, a hedge fund submitted a request that CMS reconsider its reimbursement rate for Cologuard, which was presented at a CMS public meeting on July 16, 2015. Although in November 2015, CMS issued a determination maintaining substantially the same reimbursement rate for Cologuard, we can provide no assurance that CMS will maintain its coverage or reimbursement rate in the future or that other groups will not successfully persuade CMS to reduce or terminate its coverage and reimbursement for Cologuard.\nUnder PAMA, the basis for Cologuard\u2019s CMS reimbursement rate is expected to change, beginning in January, 2017, unless the implementation date is delayed. CMS issued proposed regulations for the implementation of PAMA on September 25, 2015, but these regulations had not been finalized as of February 24, 2016. Under PAMA and the currently proposed regulations, the CMS reimbursement rate for Cologuard is expected to be calculated based on the volume-weighted median of private payor rates. For the initial rates calculated under PAMA, currently scheduled to take effect January 1, 2017, the calculation is expected to be based on the volume-weighted median of private payor rates during the period July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. Because it is unclear how or when the regulations will be finalized and PAMA will be implemented, it is hard to anticipate how PAMA will affect future CMS reimbursement for Cologuard. However, it is possible that the final PAMA regulations, or future CMS guidance or interpretations, could materially and adversely affect CMS reimbursement for Cologuard.\nPAMA, as well as other possible legal and regulatory changes, present significant uncertainty for future CMS reimbursement rates for Cologuard. Because Medicare currently covers 46% of patients in the screening population for Cologuard, any reduction in the CMS reimbursement rates for Cologuard would negatively affect our revenues and our business prospects.\nIf third-party payors, including managed care organizations, do not approve reimbursement for our Cologuard test at adequate reimbursement rates, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our Cologuard test which, we expect, would limit or slow our revenue generation and likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSuccessful commercialization of our Cologuard test depends, in large part, on the availability of adequate reimbursement from government insurance plans, managed care organizations and private insurance plans. Although we received a positive coverage decision and what we believe is a favorable initial reimbursement rate from CMS for our Cologuard test, it is also critical that other third party payors approve and maintain reimbursement for our Cologuard test at adequate reimbursement rates. Third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new healthcare products approved for marketing by the FDA. As a result, there is significant uncertainty surrounding whether the use of tests that incorporate new technology, such as our Cologuard test, will be eligible for coverage by third-party payors or, if eligible for coverage, what the reimbursement rates will be. Reimbursement of stool-based DNA colorectal cancer screening by a third-party payor may depend on a number of factors, including a payor\u2019s determination that tests using our technologies are: sensitive for colorectal cancer and pre-cancer; not experimental or investigational; approved by the major guidelines organizations; reliable, safe and effective; medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; and cost-effective.\nIf we are unable to obtain positive decisions from third-party payors, including managed care organizations, approving reimbursement for our Cologuard test at adequate levels, its commercial success will be compromised and our revenues would be significantly limited. We may also experience material delays in obtaining such reimbursement decisions and payment for our Cologuard test which are beyond our control. We are pursuing a variety of strategies to increase commercial payor coverage of Cologuard. In certain situations where we believe payors are obligated to cover Cologuard under Medicare laws and state laws that mandate coverage for certain colorectal cancer screening tests, we have sued to enforce coverage obligations. We may pursue similar litigation in the future. Such litigation may be costly,\nmay divert management attention from other responsibilities, may cause payors, including those not directly involved in the litigation, to resist contracting with us, and may ultimately prove unsuccessful.\nMoreover, coverage determinations and reimbursement rates are subject to change, and we cannot guarantee that even if we initially achieve adequate coverage and reimbursement rates, they will be applicable to our Cologuard test in the future. As noted above, under PAMA, our Medicare reimbursement rate will be subject to adjustment based on our volume-weighted median commercial reimbursement rate.\nIf our clinical studies do not satisfy providers, payors, patients and others as to the reliability, effectiveness and superiority of our Cologuard test, we may experience reluctance or refusal on the part of physicians to order, and third-party payors to pay for, our test.\nAlthough we have received FDA approval for our Cologuard test, if the results of our research and clinical studies and our sales and marketing activities relating to communication of these results, do not convince thought-leading gastroenterologists, guidelines organizations, primary care physicians and other healthcare providers, third-party payors and patients that our Cologuard test is reliable, effective and superior to alternative screening methods, we may experience reluctance or refusal on the part of physicians to order, and third-party payors to pay for, our Cologuard test, which could prevent us from successfully commercializing it.\nWe have finite selling and marketing resources and only limited sales, marketing, customer support, manufacturing, distribution and commercial laboratory experience, which may restrict our success in commercializing Cologuard and other products we may develop.\nTo grow our business as planned, we must expand our sales, marketing and customer support capabilities, which will involve developing and administering our commercial infrastructure and/or collaborative commercial arrangements and partnerships. We must also maintain satisfactory arrangements for the manufacture and distribution of our Cologuard test. Also, in connection with the launch of Cologuard in late 2014, we began operating a CLIA certified lab facility to process Cologuard tests and provide patient results. We have limited experience managing a sales force, customer support operation and operating a manufacturing operation and clinical lab facility and we may encounter difficulties retaining and managing the specialized workforce these activities require. We may seek to partner with others to assist us with any or all of these functions. However, we may be unable to find appropriate third parties with whom to enter into these arrangements. Furthermore, if we do enter into these arrangements, these third parties may not perform as expected.\nIf we are unable to deploy and maintain effective sales and marketing capabilities, we will have difficulty achieving market awareness and selling our products and services.\nTo achieve commercial success for our Cologuard test and our future products and services, we must continue to develop and grow our sales and marketing organization. We currently have a 260 person sales team, including approximately 210 in a direct field sales force. Our direct field sales force calls directly on healthcare providers throughout the United States to initiate sales of our Cologuard test. Our sales organization must explain to healthcare providers the reliability, effectiveness and benefits of Cologuard as compared to alternative screening methods. We may not be able to successfully manage our dispersed sales force. We have also entered into marketing arrangements with independent sales organizations, but we cannot be assured that they will be effective. Because of the competition for their services, we may be unable to partner with or retain additional qualified sales representatives, either as our employees or independent contractors or through independent sales organizations. Further, we may not be able to enter into agreements with sales representatives on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nEstablishing and maintaining sales and marketing capabilities will be expensive and time-consuming. Our expenses associated with maintaining our sales force may be disproportional compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales of the Cologuard test.\nThe success of our Cologuard test depends on the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community.\nOur Cologuard test may not gain market acceptance by physicians, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of our Cologuard test will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nits demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for detecting colorectal cancer and pre-cancer;\n\u00b7\nits price;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and attractiveness of alternative screening methods;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of physicians to prescribe Cologuard;\n\u00b7\nthe interval at which patients are screened using Cologuard; and\n\u00b7\nsufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nDespite the availability of current colorectal cancer screening methods as well as the recommendations of the ACS that all Americans age 50 and above be screened for colorectal cancer, approximately 47 percent of these individuals are not screened according to current guidelines. Use of a stool-based DNA colorectal cancer screening test will require people to collect a stool sample, which some people may be reluctant to do. If our Cologuard test does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate substantial revenues and we may not become profitable.\nOur assumptions regarding the market opportunity for Cologuard may not prove true. We estimate the potential market opportunity for Cologuard assuming, among other things, a 30-percent test adoption rate in the screening population and a three-year screening interval. Although ACS guidelines recommend a three-year screening interval and CMS has determined that Medicare will cover the test at this interval, physicians, healthcare payors, the FDA and other regulators and opinion leaders could recommend a different testing schedule. Further, patients may not comply with the recommended testing interval.\nRecommendations, guidelines and quality metrics issued by various organizations, including the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, the American Cancer Society and the National Committee for Quality Assurance, may significantly affect payors\u2019 willingness to cover, and physicians\u2019 willingness to prescribe, our products.\nSecuring influential recommendations, inclusion in healthcare guidelines and inclusion in quality measures are keys to our physician and payor engagement strategies. These guidelines, recommendations and quality metrics may shape payors\u2019 coverage decisions and physicians\u2019 cancer screening procedures.\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force (\u201cUSPSTF\u201d), a panel of primary care physicians and epidemiologists funded by the US. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, makes influential recommendations on clinical preventative services without considering cost-effectiveness. On October 5, 2015, the USPSTF issued a draft recommendation statement on colorectal cancer screening assigning an \u201cA\u201d grade to colorectal cancer screening for individuals starting at age 50 and continuing until age 75. Unlike prior USPSTF recommendations, the draft statement does not assign individual letter grades to individual screening tests. The draft statement designated certain screening modalities as \u201crecommended\u201d and others (including multi-target stool DNA testing, which is Cologuard) as \u201calternative tests.\u201d The draft statement indicated that the alternative tests \u201cmay be useful in select clinical circumstances\u201d but are supported by \u201cless mature evidence.\u201d We expect that a final version of the USPSTF colorectal cancer screening recommendations will be published in the second half of 2016.\nIf the final USPSTF colorectal cancer screening recommendations continue to designate Cologuard as an \u201calternative\u201d test, or otherwise fail to designate Cologuard as either a \u201crecommended\u201d test or as having an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d grade, market acceptance of Cologuard could be adversely affected, potentially materially so. For example, without a clear USPSTF \u201crecommendation\u201d or \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d grade, private health insurance plans may take the position that they are not required to cover Cologuard under the screening mandate provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (which will require most private insurance plans to cover screening tests that receive an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d grade from USPSTF without charging the patient any co-pay or deductible) and may decline to provide coverage.\nIn addition, the healthcare industry in the United States has experienced a trend toward cost containment and value-based purchasing of healthcare services. Some government and private payors are adopting pay-for-performance programs that differentiate payments for healthcare services based on the achievement of documented quality metrics, cost efficiencies or patient outcomes. Payors may look to quality measures such as the National Committee for Quality\nAssurance (\u201cNCQA\u201d), Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (\u201cHEDIS\u201d) and the CMS Star ratings to assess quality of care. These measures are intended to provide incentives to service providers to deliver the same or better results while consuming fewer resources. If Cologuard is not included in HEDIS or other quality metrics, payors may be less inclined to reimburse our Cologuard test at adequate levels, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, if Cologuard is not included in HEDIS or other quality metrics, physicians may not earn quality credit for prescribing Cologuard and therefore may be less inclined to do so.\nWe expect to make significant investments to research and develop new cancer diagnostic tools, which may not be successful.\nIn addition to commercializing our Cologuard test, we are focused on developing our pipeline for future products, including screening and diagnostic tests for lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and esophageal cancer. Our efforts to develop new cancer diagnostic tools or other products or services may not be successful, may cause us to incur significant expense and may distract our management from successfully commercializing Cologuard.\nDeveloping new cancer diagnostic tools is a speculative and risky endeavor. Candidate products that may initially show promise may fail to achieve the desired results in larger clinical studies or may not achieve acceptable levels of clinical accuracy. We may need to explore a number of different marker combinations, alter our candidate products and repeat clinical studies before we identify a potentially successful candidate. Clinical testing is expensive, takes many years to complete and can have uncertain outcome. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of the testing. If, after clinical trials, a candidate product or service appears successful, we may, depending on the nature of the product or service, still need to obtain FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals before we can market it. The FDA\u2019s clearance or approval pathways are likely to involve significant time, as well as additional research, development and clinical study expenditures. There can be no guarantee that the FDA would clear or approve any future product we may develop. Even if the FDA clears or approves a new product we develop, we would need to commit substantial resources to sell and market the product before it could be profitable and the product may never be commercially viable.\nIf we determine that any of our current or future development programs is unlikely to succeed, we may abandon it without any return on our investment into the program. Given our current levels of cash and resources, and our planned expenditures to support Cologuard commercialization, we expect that we will need to raise significant additional capital to bring any new products to market, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may not be able to successfully establish and maintain collaborative and licensing arrangements, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our Cologuard test and any other products and services.\nThe development and commercialization of our Cologuard test and any other products and services rely, directly or indirectly, upon strategic collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. We currently have collaborative and licensing arrangements with MAYO Foundation for Medical Education and Research. In addition, we have licensing agreements with Hologic and MDx Health. Such arrangements provide us with intellectual property crucial to our product development, including technology that we have incorporated into our Cologuard test. Our dependence on licensing, collaboration and other similar agreements with third parties may subject us to a number of risks. There can be no assurance that any current contractual arrangements between us and third parties or between our strategic partners and other third parties will be continued and will not be breached or terminated early. Nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to enter into the relationships necessary to successfully commercialize our Cologuard test or any other product or service we may develop. Any failure to obtain or retain the rights to necessary technologies could require us to re-configure our products and services, which could negatively impact their commercial sale or increase the associated costs, either of which could materially harm our business and adversely affect our future revenues.\nAs we seek to commercialize and market our Cologuard test and develop new products and services, we expect to continue and expand our reliance on collaborative and licensing arrangements. Establishing new strategic collaborations and licensing arrangements is difficult and time-consuming. Discussions with potential collaborators or licensors may not lead to the establishment of collaborations on favorable terms, if at all. To the extent we agree to work exclusively with one collaborator in a given area, our opportunities to collaborate with other entities could be limited. Potential collaborators or licensors may reject collaborations with us based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position. Even if we successfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful commercialization of our Cologuard test or any other product or service.\nEven though our Cologuard test has received regulatory clearance in the United States, if we do not receive regulatory clearance for Cologuard in other jurisdictions, our prospects may be materially and negatively affected.\nGovernments in countries outside the United States also regulate diagnostic tests marketed in such countries, and obtaining their approvals can be lengthy, expensive and highly uncertain. The approval process varies from country to country and the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to finalize operational, reimbursement, price approval and funding processes prior to marketing our Cologuard test. We may not receive regulatory approval for our Cologuard test any of these countries on a timely basis, if ever. Even if approval is granted in any such country, the approval may require limitations on the uses or availability of our Cologuard test. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for our Cologuard test in territories outside the United States could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.\nIf we fail to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or similar state laws, that failure could adversely affect any future payor consideration of our technologies, prevent their approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale of any products and services and otherwise cause us to incur significant expense.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws and regulations regarding the operation of clinical laboratories. Federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (\u201cCLIA\u201d) requirements and laws of certain states impose certification requirements for clinical laboratories, and establish standards for quality assurance and quality control, among other things. Clinical laboratories are subject to inspection by regulators, and to sanctions for failing to comply with applicable requirements. Sanctions available under CLIA include prohibiting a laboratory from running tests, requiring a laboratory to implement a corrective plan, and imposing civil monetary penalties. If we fail to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or state law, that failure could adversely affect any future payor consideration of our technologies, prevent their approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale of any products and services and otherwise cause us to incur significant expense.\nWe must maintain FDA approval for Cologuard and of our Madison, Wisconsin, facilities; failure to maintain compliance with FDA requirements may prevent or delay the marketing or manufacture of our Cologuard test.\nAs a condition of the FDA approval of our Cologuard test, we are required to conduct a post-approval study. We anticipate that the post-approval study will require significant funding and resources to reach its conclusion. There is a risk that the FDA may modify or withdraw the approval of Cologuard if the results of this post-approval study are not satisfactory or are inconsistent with previous studies. We expect to rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct the post-approval study. We have reduced control over the activities of these third parties and the initiation and completion of the post-approval study may be prevented, delayed or halted for reasons outside our control.\nAdditionally, our Madison, Wisconsin facilities are periodically subject to inspection by the FDA and other governmental agencies to ensure they meet production and quality standards. Operations at these facilities could be interrupted or halted if the FDA deems such inspections are unsatisfactory. Failure to comply with FDA or other regulatory requirements could result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizures of our products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, termination of ongoing research, disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution.\nOur inability to obtain without delay any necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new diagnostic products or services, or improvements to our current offerings, could materially encumber future product commercialization.\nWe may develop new diagnostic test candidates that are likely to be regulated by the FDA as medical devices. Unless otherwise exempted, medical devices must receive from the FDA either \u201c510(k) clearance\u201d or pre-market approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) before marketing them in the United States. The FDA determines whether a medical device will require either 510(k) clearance or the PMA process based on statutory criteria that include the risk associated with the device and whether the device is similar to an existing, legally marketed product. The process to obtain either 510(k) clearance or PMA will likely be costly, time-consuming and uncertain. However, we believe the PMA process is generally more challenging. Even if we design a product that we expect to be eligible for the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA may require that the product undergo the PMA process. There can be no assurance that the FDA will ever permit us to market any new product or service that we develop. Even if regulatory approval is granted, such approval\nmay include significant limitations on indicated uses, which could materially and adversely affect the prospects of any new product or service.\nFDA regulatory approval or clearance is not just required for new products and services we develop, but would also be required for certain enhancements we may seek to make to our Cologuard test.\nDelays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals could materially delay or prevent us from commercializing our products and services or result in substantial additional costs which could decrease our profitability. In addition, even if we receive FDA clearance or approval for a new or enhanced product or service, the FDA may withdraw or materially modify its clearance or approval.\nIn the future, we plan to develop diagnostic products or services that could be regulated as laboratory developed tests (\u201cLDTs\u201d). If the FDA proceeds with its plans to actively regulate LDTs, we may need to obtain additional FDA or other regulatory approvals, which may delay, encumber or block us from commercializing these diagnostic tests.\nWe may also develop diagnostic test candidates that, under today\u2019s regulations, would be regulated as LDTs under CLIA. LDTs are clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use. Historically, LDTs have been regulated under CLIA while the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion and not required approvals or clearances for most LDTs performed by CLIA-certified laboratories. The FDA has traditionally chosen not to exercise its authority to regulate LDTs because it regulates the primary components in most LDTs and because it believes that laboratories certified as high complexity under CLIA, such as ours, have demonstrated expertise and ability in test procedures and analysis.\nIn October 2014, the FDA published two draft guidance documents describing the proposed risk-based framework under which they might regulate LDTs. The FDA\u2019s draft framework proposed, among other things, premarket review for higher-risk LDTs, such as those that have the same intended use as FDA-approved or cleared diagnostics currently on the market. In November 2015, the FDA issued a report citing evidence for the need for additional regulation of LDTs and stated the FDA is continuing to work to finalize premarket review requirements for LDTs. The FDA\u2019s guidance documents, if and when finalized, may materially impact our development of LDTs and may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these regulations. New laws and regulations may significantly slow the time it takes us to bring LDTs to market, may materially increase the costs of developing, and decrease the profitability of providing, LDTs, and may prevent us from commercializing certain diagnostic test candidates.\nWe currently perform our Cologuard test predominantly in one laboratory facility. If this or any future facility or our equipment were damaged or destroyed, or if we experience a significant disruption in our operations for any reason, our ability to continue to operate our business could be materially harmed.\nWe currently perform our Cologuard test predominantly in a single laboratory facility in Madison, Wisconsin. Our headquarters and manufacturing facilities are also located in Madison, Wisconsin. If these, or any future facilities, were to be damaged, destroyed or otherwise unable to operate, whether due to fire, floods, storms, tornadoes, other inclement weather events or natural disasters, employee malfeasance, terrorist acts, power outages, or otherwise, our business could be severely disrupted. If our Madison, Wisconsin, laboratory is disrupted, we may not be able to perform our Cologuard test or generate test reports as promptly as patients and healthcare providers require or expect, or possibly not at all. If we are unable to perform our Cologuard test or generate test reports within a timeframe that meets patient and healthcare provider expectations, our business, financial results and reputation could be materially harmed.\nWe currently maintain insurance against damage to our property and equipment and against business interruption and research and development restoration expenses, subject to deductibles and other limitations. If we have underestimated our insurance needs with respect to an interruption, or if an interruption is not subject to coverage under our insurance policies, we may not be able to cover our losses.\nWe rely upon certain single-source suppliers and loss or interruption of supply from single-source suppliers could have a disruptive effect on our business.\nWe purchase certain supplies from third-party suppliers and manufacturers. In some cases, due to the unique attributes of products that are incorporated into our Cologuard test, we maintain a single-source supplier relationship. These third parties are independent entities subject to their own unique operational and financial risks that are outside\nour control. These third parties may not perform their obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner and they may be unwilling to increase production capacity commensurate with demand for our Cologuard test or future products. The loss of a single-source supplier, the failure to perform by a single-source supplier, the deterioration of our relationship with a single-source supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied materials by a single-source supplier could have a disruptive effect on our business, and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure in our information technology, storage systems or our clinical laboratory equipment could significantly disrupt our operations and our research and development efforts, which could adversely impact our revenues, as well as our research, development and commercialization efforts.\nOur ability to execute our business strategy depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology, or IT, systems, which support our operations, including at our clinical laboratory, and our research and development efforts. We are substantially dependent on our IT systems to receive and process Cologuard test orders, securely store patient health records and deliver the results of our Cologuard tests. The integrity and protection of our own data, and that of our customers and employees, is critical to our business. The regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data, and in particular to operate our clinical laboratory, could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Any interruption in the operation of IT systems could have an adverse effect on our operations. Furthermore, any breach in our IT systems could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and damage to our reputation.\nWe rely on courier delivery services to transport Cologuard collection kits to patients and samples back to laboratory facilities for analysis. If these delivery services are disrupted or become prohibitively expensive, customer satisfaction and our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe ship Cologuard collection kits to patients, and patients ship samples to our Madison, Wisconsin, laboratory facility or other clinical laboratories for analysis, by air and ground express courier delivery service. Disruptions in delivery service, whether due to bad weather, natural disaster, terrorist acts or threats, or for other reasons, can adversely affect customer satisfaction, specimen quality and our ability to provide our services on a timely basis. If the courier delivery services that transport Cologuard collection kits institute significant price increases, our profitability would be negatively affected and we may need to identify alternative delivery methods, if possible, modify our service model, or attempt to raise our pricing, which may not be possible with regard to Medicare claims or commercially practicable with regard to commercial claims.\nDue to billing complexities in the diagnostic and laboratory service industry, we may not be able to collect fees for the Cologuard tests we perform.\nBilling for diagnostic and laboratory services is a complex process. Laboratories bill many different payors including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. We are continuing to work with third-party payors to cover and reimburse Cologuard tests. If we are unsuccessful, we may not receive payment for Cologuard tests we perform for patients on a timely basis, if at all, and we may not be able to provide services for patients with certain healthcare plans. We may have to litigate to enforce coverage obligations under Medicare laws and state laws that mandate coverage for certain colorectal cancer screening tests or to enforce contractual coverage obligations. Such litigation may be costly, may divert management attention from other responsibilities, may cause payors, including those not directly involved in the litigation, to resist contracting with us, and may ultimately prove unsuccessful. We may face write-offs of doubtful accounts, disputes with payors and long collection cycles. We may face patient dissatisfaction, complaints or lawsuits to the extent Cologuard tests are not covered, or fully covered, by insurers and patients become responsible for all or part of the price of the test. As a result, patient demand for Cologuard could be adversely affected. To the extent patients\nexpress dissatisfaction with our billing practices to their physicians, those physicians may be less likely to prescribe Cologuard for other patients, and our business would be adversely affected.\nEven if payors do agree to cover Cologuard, our billing and collections process may be complicated by the following and other factors, which may be beyond our control:\n\u00b7\ndisputes among payors as to which payor is responsible for payment;\n\u00b7\ndisparity in coverage among various payors or among various healthcare plans offered by a single payor;\n\u00b7\ndiffering information and billing requirements among payors; and\n\u00b7\nfailure by patients or physicians to provide complete and correct billing information.\nThe uncertainty of receiving payment for our Cologuard test and complex laboratory billing processes could negatively affect our business and our operating results.\nWe may be subject to substantial costs and liability, or be prevented from using technologies incorporated in our Cologuard test, as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent or other intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against our licensors, our licensees, our suppliers, our strategic partners or us. We pursue a patent strategy that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in the non-invasive early detection of colorectal cancer and pre-cancer and is designed to maximize our patent protection against third parties in the United States and, potentially, in certain foreign countries. We have filed patent applications that we believe cover the methods we have designed and use in our Cologuard test to detect colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. In order to protect or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, we may have to initiate actions against third parties. Any actions regarding patents could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business. Additionally, such actions could result in challenges to the validity or applicability of our patents. Because the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office maintains patent applications in secrecy until a patent application publishes or the patent is issued, we have no way of knowing if others may have filed patent applications covering technologies used by us or our partners. Additionally, there may be third-party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our technologies that may block or compete with our technologies. From time to time we have received correspondence from third parties alleging to hold intellectual property rights that could block our commercialization of products. While none of these inquiries to date have had any material effect on us, and while we do not believe that any pending correspondence would have such an effect, we may receive inquiries in the future that could have a material effect on our business. Even if third-party claims are without merit, defending a lawsuit may result in substantial expense to us and may divert the attention of management and key personnel. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we would prevail in any such suits or that the damages or other remedies, if any, awarded against us would not be substantial. Claims of intellectual property infringement may require that we, or our strategic partners, enter into royalty or license agreements with third parties that may only be available on unacceptable terms, if at all. These claims may also result in injunctions against the further development and commercial sale of services or products containing our technologies, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlso, patents and patent applications owned by us may become the subject of interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial cost to us as well as a possible adverse decision as to the priority of invention of the patent or patent application involved. An adverse decision in an interference proceeding may result in the loss of rights under a patent or patent application subject to such a proceeding.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property, which would impair any competitive advantage we may otherwise have.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret protection and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies, all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. If we fail to protect our intellectual\nproperty, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us and we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in issued patents, and we cannot predict how long it will take for any such patents to be issued. Further, we cannot assure you that other parties will not challenge any patents issued to us or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold our patents to be valid or enforceable. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, the subject of opposition proceedings relating to our patents. We cannot guarantee you that we will be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge to our patents could result in co-ownership of such patents with the third party or the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents. Furthermore, in the life sciences field, courts frequently render opinions that may affect the patentability of certain inventions or discoveries, including opinions that may affect the patentability of isolated DNA and/or methods for analyzing or comparing DNA. Such decisions may adversely impact our ability to obtain new patents and facilitate third-party challenges to our existing patents.\nOur business is subject to various complex laws and regulations. We could be subject to significant fines and penalties if we or our partners fail to comply with these regulations.\nAs a provider of clinical diagnostic products and services, we and our partners are subject to extensive and frequently changing foreign and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations governing various aspects of our business. In particular, the clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant governmental certification and licensing regulations, as well as foreign and U.S. federal and state laws regarding:\n\u00b7\ntest ordering and billing practices;\n\u00b7\nmarketing, sales and pricing practices;\n\u00b7\nhealth information privacy and security, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and comparable state laws;\n\u00b7\ninsurance;\n\u00b7\nanti-markup legislation; and\n\u00b7\nconsumer protection.\nWe are also required to comply with FDA regulations, including with respect to our labeling and promotion activities. In addition, advertising of our tests is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC. Violation of any FDA requirement could result in enforcement actions, such as seizures, injunctions, civil penalties and criminal prosecutions, and violation of any FTC requirement could result in injunctions and other associated remedies, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Most states also have similar regulatory and enforcement authority for devices. Additionally, most foreign countries have authorities comparable to the FDA and processes for obtaining marketing approvals. Obtaining and maintaining these approvals, and complying with all laws and regulations, may subject us to similar risks and delays as those we could experience under FDA and FTC regulation. We incur various costs in complying and overseeing compliance with these laws and regulations.\nHealthcare policy has been a subject of extensive discussion in the executive and legislative branches of the federal and many state governments and healthcare laws and regulations are subject to change. Development of the existing commercialization strategy for our Cologuard test has been based on existing healthcare policies. We cannot predict what additional changes, if any, will be proposed or adopted or the effect that such proposals or adoption may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we or our partners, including independent sales representatives, fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could incur significant fines and penalties and our reputation and prospects could suffer. Additionally, our partners could be forced to cease offering our products and services in certain jurisdictions, which could materially disrupt our business.\nSome of our activities may subject us to risks under federal and state laws prohibiting \u2018kickbacks\u2019 and false or fraudulent claims.\nIn addition to FDA marketing restrictions, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict certain marketing practices in the healthcare product and service industry\nand to regulate billing practices and financial relationships with physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers. These laws include a federal law commonly known as the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback law, and several similar state laws, which prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. While the federal law applies only to referrals, products or services for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program, state laws often apply regardless of whether federal funds may be involved. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical devices and providers of laboratory services by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs that may be used with hospitals, physicians, laboratories and other potential purchasers or prescribers of medical devices and laboratory services. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Additionally, to avoid liability under federal false claims laws, we must carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, proactively monitor the accuracy and appropriateness of Medicare claims and payments received, diligently investigate any credible information indicating that we may have received an overpayment, and promptly return any overpayments. Currently, a significant percentage of our revenues are generated by payments from Medicare. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties (including fines) for noncompliance that can be substantial. While we continually strive to comply with these complex requirements, interpretations of the applicability of these laws to marketing and billing practices are constantly evolving and even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and prospects. Our failure to comply with applicable laws could result in various adverse consequences which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, including the exclusion of our products and services from government programs and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions.\nCompliance with the HIPAA security, privacy and breach notification regulations may increase our costs.\nThe HIPAA privacy, security and breach notification regulations, including the expanded requirements under HITECH, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health insurance (\u201cPHI\u201d) by health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of PHI. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:\n\u00b7\nthe circumstances under which uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for our services, and our healthcare operations activities;\n\u00b7\na patient\u2019s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI;\n\u00b7\nrequirements to notify individuals if there is a breach of their PHI;\n\u00b7\nthe contents of notices of privacy practices for PHI;\n\u00b7\nadministrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive PHI; and\n\u00b7\nthe protection of computing systems maintaining electronic PHI.\nWe have implemented practices to meet the requirements of the HIPAA privacy, security and breach notification regulations, as required by law. We are required to comply with federal privacy, security and breach notification regulations as well as varying state privacy, security and breach notification laws and regulations, which may be more stringent than federal HIPAA requirements. In addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, we must comply with the laws of those countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patient identifiable data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment, healthcare operations and certain other specified disclosures such as public health and governmental oversight of the healthcare industry.\nHIPAA provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. Computer networks are always vulnerable to breach and unauthorized persons may in the future be able to exploit weaknesses in the security systems of our computer networks and gain access to PHI. Additionally, we share PHI with third-party contractors who are contractually obligated to safeguard and maintain the confidentiality of PHI. Unauthorized persons may be able to gain access to PHI stored in such third-party contractors\u2019 computer networks. Any wrongful use or disclosure of PHI by us or our third-party contractors, including disclosure due to data theft or unauthorized access to our or our third-party contractors\u2019 computer networks, could subject us to fines or penalties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Although the HIPAA statute and regulations\ndo not expressly provide for a private right of damages, we could also incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information.\nThe success of our business is substantially dependent upon the efforts of our senior management team.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our senior management team including Kevin Conroy, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Maneesh Arora, our Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Graham Lidgard, our Senior Vice President and Chief Science Officer, and John Bakewell, our Chief Financial Officer. These executives are critical to directing and managing our growth and development in the future. Our success is substantially dependent upon our senior management\u2019s ability to lead our company, implement successful corporate strategies and initiatives, develop key relationships, including relationships with collaborators and business partners, and successfully commercialize products and services in the United States and abroad. While our management team has significant experience in securing FDA approvals for diagnostic products, we have considerably less experience in commercializing a product or service. The efforts of our management team will be critical to us as we develop our technologies and seek to commercialize our Cologuard test and other FDA approved products and services.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our managerial personnel and to attract additional personnel.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain managerial personnel. If we were to lose any of our senior management team, we may experience difficulties in competing effectively, developing our technologies and implementing our business strategies. Competition for desirable personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary staff. The failure to maintain management or to attract sales personnel as we commercialize our Cologuard test could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur management has broad discretion over the use of our available cash and marketable securities and might not spend available cash and marketable securities in ways that increase the value of your investment.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $306.9 million in combined cash and marketable securities. Our management currently expects to deploy these resources primarily to expand our Cologuard commercialization activities, to fund our product development efforts and for general corporate and working capital purposes. However, our management has broad discretion to pursue other objectives. You will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application and prioritization of our resources. Our management might not apply our cash and marketable securities in ways that increase on, or permit any return of, your investment.\nOur business and reputation will suffer if we are unable to establish and comply with, stringent quality standards to assure that the highest level of quality is observed in the performance our Cologuard test.\nInherent risks are involved in providing and marketing cancer diagnostic tests, such as our Cologuard test, and related services. Patients and healthcare providers rely on us to provide accurate clinical and diagnostic information that may be used to make critical healthcare decisions. As such, users of our Cologuard test may have a greater sensitivity to errors than users of some other types of products and services.\nWe must maintain top service standards and FDA-mandated and other quality controls. Performance defects, incomplete or improper process controls, excessively slow turnaround times, unanticipated uses of Cologuard or mishandling of stool samples or Cologuard test results (whether by us, patients, healthcare providers, courier delivery services or others) can lead to adverse outcomes for patients and interruptions to our services. These events could lead to voluntary or legally mandated safety alerts relating to Cologuard or our laboratory facility and could result in the removal of Cologuard from the market or the suspension of our laboratory\u2019s operations. Insufficient quality controls and any resulting negative outcomes, could result in significant costs and litigation, as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for Cologuard and payors\u2019 willingness to cover our Cologuard test. Even if we maintain adequate controls and procedures, damaging and costly errors may occur.\nProduct and professional liability suits against us could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation, payment of substantial damages and increases in our insurance rates.\nThe sale and use of our Cologuard test could lead to product or professional liability claims based on, among other things, allegations that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect or our laboratory was negligent in processing test results, which resulted in the failure to detect the disease for which it was designed or an unnecessary procedure which caused harm. A product or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages, be costly and time consuming to defend, and cause material harm to our business, reputation or financial condition. We cannot assure you that our liability insurance would protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a liability claim. Any claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct any future studies of our technologies that may be required by the FDA or other US or foreign regulatory bodies, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct the clinical or other studies that will be required to obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for future products we may develop or the approval of foreign regulatory bodies that may be required for such future products as well as our Cologuard test. Accordingly, we expect to rely on third parties such as contract research organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct any such studies. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities will reduce our control over these activities. These third-party contractors may not complete activities on schedule or conduct studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our study design. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control will not relieve us of our requirement to prepare, and ensure our compliance with, various procedures required under good clinical practices, even though third-party contract research organizations may prepare and comply with their own, comparable procedures. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our studies may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain a required regulatory approval.\nOur inability to manage growth could harm our business.\nIn connection with launching the commercialization of our Cologuard test, we have added, and expect to continue to add, additional personnel in the areas of sales and marketing, laboratory operations, billing and collections, quality assurance and compliance. Our number of full time employees has increased from 102, as of December 31, 2013, to 677, as of December 31, 2015. Further, as we build our commercialization efforts and expand research and development activities for new products, the scope and complexity of our operations is increasing significantly. As a result of our growth, our operating expenses and capital requirements have also increased, and we expect that they will continue to increase, significantly. Our ability to manage our growth effectively requires us to forecast expenses accurately and to expend funds to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. As we move forward in commercializing our Cologuard test, we will also need to effectively manage our manufacturing, laboratory operations and sales and marketing needs, which represent new areas of oversight for us. If we are unable to manage our anticipated growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\nOur growing international operations could subject us to risks and expenses that could adversely impact the business and results of operations.\nWe expect to increase the availability of our Cologuard test in non-U.S. markets and to expand our operations in foreign countries. Our international expansion exposes us to risks from the failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those under which we operate in the U.S., as well as U.S. rules and regulations that govern foreign activities such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, we may be adversely affected by other risks associated with operating in foreign countries. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas.\nRisks inherent in our international operations include:\n\u00b7\nnumerous and varied non-U.S. regulatory requirements, including with respect to healthcare, that are subject to change and that could limit our ability to offer or market our Cologuard test or other products and services we may develop on acceptable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7\nnumerous and varied U.S. regulatory requirements, including import- and export-related laws and regulations and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u00b7\nchanges by foreign governments and other foreign healthcare payors in reimbursement rates for our Cologuard test or other products and services we may develop;\n\u00b7\ndiffering local preferences and expectations for healthcare services;\n\u00b7\ndiffering private and public health insurance systems, including differing approaches to coverage determinations and reimbursement amounts;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency exchange controls and tax rates;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations;\n\u00b7\npotential changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures;\n\u00b7\npolitical instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-U.S. operations\n\u00b7\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u00b7\npotential changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u00b7\nminimal protection of intellectual and other property rights in certain jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nvarying enforcement of contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; and\n\u00b7\nrestrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, as well as the potential nationalization or seizure of business enterprises or assets.\nThese and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDelaware law, our charter documents and rights agreement could impede or discourage a takeover or change of control that stockholders may consider favorable.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Accordingly, our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of our company. In addition, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7\nOur board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms.\n\u00b7\nOnly our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board.\n\u00b7\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent.\n\u00b7\nThere are various limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders and advance notice requirements for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\n\u00b7\nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock.\nThese types of provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nIn addition, we have adopted a rights agreement that provides that in the event of (i) an acquisition of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock or (ii) an announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, our stockholders, other than the potential acquiror, shall be granted rights enabling them to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a substantial discount to the then prevailing market price. The rights agreement could significantly dilute such acquiror\u2019s ownership position in our shares, thereby making a takeover prohibitively expensive and encouraging such acquiror to negotiate with our board of directors. Therefore, the rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors.\nWe may engage in acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and reduce our financial resources.\nIn the future, we may enter into transactions to acquire other businesses, products, services or technologies. Because we have not made any acquisitions to date, our ability to do so successfully is unproven. If we do identify suitable candidates, we may not be able to make such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Any acquisitions we make may not strengthen our competitive position, and these transactions may be viewed negatively by investors, healthcare providers, patients and others. We may decide to incur debt in connection with an acquisition or issue our common stock or other securities to the stockholders of the acquired company, which would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. We could incur losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of the acquired business that are not covered by any indemnification we may obtain from the seller. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel, technologies and operations into our existing business in an effective, timely and non-disruptive manner. Acquisitions may also divert management from day-to-day responsibilities, increase our expenses and reduce our cash available for operations and other uses. We cannot predict the number, timing or size of future acquisitions or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating results.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of approximately $565.9 million and $208.9 million, respectively. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50% change in equity ownership by value over a specified time period (generally three years). Given the Code\u2019s broad definition, an ownership change could be the unintended consequence of otherwise normal market trading in our stock that is outside our control. An ownership change under Section 382 of the Code could also be triggered by certain strategic transactions. Additionally, tax law limitations may result in our NOLs expiring before we have the ability to use them. For these reasons, even if we attain profitability our ability to utilize our NOLs may be limited, potentially significantly so.\nOur stock price has fluctuated widely and is likely to continue to be volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock varied between a high of $32.85 and a low of $6.79 in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2015. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including those listed in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d section and other, unknown factors. Our stock price also may be affected by:\n\u00b7\ncomments by securities analysts regarding our business or prospects;\n\u00b7\nour issuance of common stock or other securities;\n\u00b7\nour inability to accurately forecast future performance;\n\u00b7\nour inability to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u00b7\ngeneral fluctuations in the stock market or in the stock prices of companies in the life sciences or healthcare diagnostics industries; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral conditions and publicity regarding the life sciences or healthcare diagnostics industries.\nConsequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock. Further, sharp drops in the market price of our common stock, such as we experienced in 2015, may expose us to securities class-action litigation. Such litigation could result in substantial expenses and diversion of management\u2019s attention and corporate resources, which would seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not intend to do so.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently plan to retain any earnings to finance the growth of our business rather than to pay cash dividends. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 88863, "SIC": 8731, "TIC": "EXAS"}
