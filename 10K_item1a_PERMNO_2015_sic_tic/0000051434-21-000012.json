{"cik": "51434", "company": "INTERNATIONAL PAPER CO /NEW/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global, regional, and local events that could have an adverse impact on its\nreputation, operations, and financial performance. The Board of Directors exercises oversight of the Company\u2019s enterprise risk management program, which includes strategic, operational and financial matters, as well as compliance and legal risks. The Audit and Finance Committee coordinates the risk oversight role exercised by the Board\u2019s standing committees and management, and it receives updates on the risk management processes twice per year.\nIn addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (particularly in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), or in the Company\u2019s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following are some important factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. If any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors occurs, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statements we make in any public disclosures.\nOVERALL RISKS\nTHE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON PORTIONS OF OUR BUSINESS, AND MAY HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS, PARTICULARLY IF NEGATIVE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 PERSIST OR DETERIORATE. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities throughout the world implementing widespread measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home orders, the promotion of social distancing and limitations on business activity, including business closures. These measures and the pandemic have caused a significant global economic downturn, disrupting supply chains, significantly increasing unemployment and underemployment levels, and adversely impacting consumer confidence and spending. The continued spread of COVID-19 has also led to significant disruption and volatility in the global capital and financial markets.\nAlthough governments of countries in which we operate have generally considered forest products and the supply chain on which we depend to be \u201cessential industries\u201d that should remain operational during this pandemic, any significant disruption in operations at one or more of our mills, plants or other\nfacilities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including precautionary measures we take or are taken by governmental authorities that limits in-person workplace contact at any of our facilities to reduce the potential for employee exposure to COVID-19, could have an adverse effect on our business or operations. If a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work effectively due to measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic such as those described herein, our operations will likely be negatively impacted.\nCOVID-19 has had a significant negative impact on demand for our printing papers products. In addition, our operations in Industrial Packaging experienced higher supply chain costs due to the impact of COVID-19.\nIn addition to the reduction in demand for our products that the COVID-19 pandemic has had or could have, other negative impacts on our business, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022We rely on a global workforce, and we take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and others with whom we do business, while continuing to effectively manage our employees and maintain business operations. During the pandemic, we have taken additional measures and incurred additional expenses to protect the health and safety of our employees to comply with applicable government requirements and safety guidance. Our business operations may be additionally disrupted if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work safely and effectively due to illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions or measures responsive to the pandemic. Measures taken across our business operations to address health and safety may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employee base, customers and others.\n\u2022A significant number of our employees as well as customers and others with whom we do business, continue to work remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business operations may be disrupted, and we may experience increased risk of adverse effects to our business, if a significant portion of our workforce or certain business operations are negatively impacted as a result of remote work arrangements, including due to cyber risks or other disruption to our technology infrastructure.\n\u2022Cost management and various cost-containment actions implemented across our business in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could hinder execution of our business strategy, including deferral of planned capital expenditures, and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWhile we are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business, the extent of the impact on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, and financial performance, as well as our ability to execute near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain and which we cannot predict or control, and some of which we are not currently aware, including, but not limited to: (a) the duration, severity and scope of the pandemic, including additional waves, increases and spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases in certain areas; (b) rapidly-changing governmental and public health directives to contain and combat the outbreak, including the duration, degree and effectiveness of directives, as well as the easing, removal and potential reinstitution of directives; (c) the availability and wide-spread administration of treatments and vaccines for COVID-19; (d) the extent and duration of the pandemic\u2019s adverse effect on economic and social activity, consumer confidence, discretionary spending and preferences, labor and healthcare costs, and unemployment rates, any of which may reduce demand for our products; (e) any temporary reduction in our workforce, closures of our offices and facilities and our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations; and (f) the ability of our customers and suppliers to continue their operations, which could result in terminations of contracts, losses of revenue, adverse effects to our supply chain. If the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, or impacts our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we expect the pandemic will continue to have an adverse impact on portions of our business in the near term. If these conditions persist for a prolonged period, the COVID-19 pandemic, including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, or financial condition.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL WEATHER CONDITIONS.\nOur operations and the operations of our suppliers are subject to climate variations, which impact the productivity of forests, the frequency and severity of wildfires, the distribution and abundance of species, and the spread of disease or insect epidemics. Additionally, the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, snow, ice storms, the spread of disease, and insect infestations could also affect timber supply or cause variations in the cost of raw materials. Changes in precipitation could make wildfires more frequent or more severe, and could adversely affect timber harvesting. The effects of climate change and global, regional and local weather conditions could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO INDUSTRY CONDITIONS\nCHANGES IN THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION COULD AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. We rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials (principally virgin wood fiber, recycled fiber, caustic soda and starch), energy sources (principally biomass, natural gas, electricity and fuel oil) and third-party companies that transport our goods. The market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source. The global supply and demand for recycled fiber may be affected by trade policies between countries, individual governments' legislation and regulations, as well as changes in the global economy. In addition, the increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, may cause significant fluctuations in recycled fiber prices. Energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. The availability of labor and the market price for fuel may affect our costs for third-party transportation. Our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources.\nTHE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE EXPERIENCE BOTH ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICES OF, AND THE DEMAND FOR, OUR PRODUCTS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and\ngeneral economic conditions. The length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. In addition, changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiber-based products and non-fiber substitutes. Moreover, consumer preferences are constantly changing based on, among other factors, cost, convenience and health, environmental and social concerns and perceptions. These consumer preferences affect the prices of our products. Consequently, our financial results are sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products.\nCOMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. We operate in a competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally, in all of our operating segments. Product innovations, manufacturing and operating efficiencies, and marketing, distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results.\nRISKS RELATING TO MARKET AND ECONOMIC FACTORS\nADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN GENERAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. General economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products. In addition, volatility in the capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.\nCHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the United States in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. Specifically, Russia, Brazil, Poland, and Turkey, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities, are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world. Fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar, downturns in economic activity, adverse tax consequences or rulings, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions impacting matters such as sustainability, environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements, could negatively affect our financial results. Trade protection measures in favor\nof local producers of competing products, including governmental subsidies, tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over International Paper, may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries. Likewise, disruption in existing trade agreements or increased trade friction between countries (e.g., the U.S. and China), which can result in tariffs, could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations by restricting the free flow of goods and services across borders. In addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad, and the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control and other non-U.S. government entities maintain economic sanctions targeting various countries, persons and entities. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations.\nTHE LEVEL OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. As of December 31, 2020, International Paper had approximately $8.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness. The level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, including the following:\n\u2022it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, dividends, share repurchases, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations;\n\u2022it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022it may increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.\nIn addition, we are subject to agreements governing our indebtedness that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and covenants. A significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions, or other significant adverse developments with respect to our results of operations or financial condition, may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives. Moreover, the restrictions associated with these financial ratios and covenants may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Additionally, despite these restrictions, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility and otherwise increase the risks associated with our indebtedness as noted above.\nMoreover, certain of our variable rate debt uses the London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In November 2020, the administrator of LIBOR announced it will consult on its intention to extend the retirement date of certain offered rates whereby the publication of the one week and two month LIBOR offered rates will cease after December 31, 2021, but the publication of the remaining LIBOR offered rates will continue until June 20 2023. In addition, other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. Additionally, uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt.\nCHANGES IN CREDIT RATINGS ISSUED BY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FINANCING AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES. Maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is an important element of our\nfinancial strategy, and a downgrade of the Company\u2019s ratings below investment grade will likely eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper market, may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position. The Company\u2019s desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the Company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow, including sale of assets, suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital.\nUnder the terms of the agreements governing approximately $1.0 billion of our debt as of December 31, 2020, the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade. As a result, a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense. There can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any such downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur.\nDOWNGRADES IN THE CREDIT RATINGS OF BANKS ISSUING CERTAIN LETTERS OF CREDIT WILL INCREASE OUR COST OF MAINTAINING CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS AND MAY RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF DEFERRED TAXES. We are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes, including those delivered to Temple-Inland in connection with Temple-Inland's 2007 sales of forestlands, may be downgraded below a required rating. Since 2007, certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced, or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement. As a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment, a number of the letter-of-credit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited. The downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the Company to additional costs of securing a replacement letter-of-credit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to $488 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained. The deferred taxes are currently recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 15, Variable Interest Entities,\non pages 70 through 72, and Note 13, Income Taxes, on pages 65 through 68, in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.\nOUR PENSION AND HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS FACTORS WHICH COULD CAUSE THESE COSTS TO CHANGE. We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. salaried employees hired prior to July 1, 2004 (or later for certain acquired populations, as described in Note 19. Retirement Plans, on pages 78 through 84, in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) and substantially all hourly union and non-union employees regardless of hire date. The Company has frozen participation under these plans for U.S. salaried employees, including credited service and compensation on or after January 1, 2019; however, the pension freeze does not affect benefits accrued through December 31, 2018. We provide retiree health care benefits to certain former U.S. employees, as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former U.S. salaried employees. Our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may impact pension costs in future periods. Likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs. Drivers for fluctuating health costs include unit cost changes, health care utilization by participants, and potential legislative impacts and government oversight.\nOUR PENSION PLANS ARE CURRENTLY UNDERFUNDED ON A PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION BASIS, AND OVER TIME WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS TO THE PLANS, REDUCING THE CASH AVAILABLE FOR OUR BUSINESS. We record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. The benefit liability recorded under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 715, \u201cCompensation - Retirement Benefits,\u201d at December 31, 2020 was $1.1 billion. The amount and timing of future contributions, which could be material, will depend upon a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS\nMATERIAL DISRUPTIONS AT ONE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COULD\nNEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. We operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. A material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial condition. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:\n\u2022fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes;\n\u2022the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply;\n\u2022the effect of other severe weather conditions on equipment and facilities;\n\u2022disruption in the supply of raw materials or other manufacturing inputs;\n\u2022terrorism or threats of terrorism;\n\u2022information system disruptions or failures due to any number of causes, including cyber-attacks;\n\u2022domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our Company and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the world;\n\u2022unscheduled maintenance outages;\n\u2022prolonged power failures;\n\u2022an equipment failure;\n\u2022a chemical spill or release;\n\u2022explosion of a boiler or other equipment;\n\u2022damage or disruptions caused by third parties operating on or adjacent to one of our manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;\n\u2022a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, or any other public health crisis;\n\u2022failure of our third party service providers and business partners to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed upon terms;\n\u2022labor difficulties; and\n\u2022other operational problems.\nAny such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned expenditures. If one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results.\nCERTAIN OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED BY JOINT VENTURES THAT WE CANNOT OPERATE SOLELY FOR OUR BENEFIT. Certain operations in Russia are carried on by a joint venture, Ilim. In joint ventures, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. In general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. In joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co-owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. In addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so we receive only our portion of those benefits.\nTHE ANNOUNCED PROPOSED SPIN-OFF OF OUR PRINTING PAPERS BUSINESS MAY NOT BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE EXPECTED TIMEFRAME, OR AT ALL, AND WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM THE SEPARATION. On December 3, 2020, we announced a plan to pursue a spin-off of our Printing Papers segment into SpinCo, a standalone, publicly traded company. International Paper will distribute shares of SpinCo to International Paper shareholders on a pro rata basis in a manner intended to be tax-free to International Paper and its shareholders for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. The transaction is expected to be completed in late third quarter 2021. The proposed spin-off is subject to customary conditions, including final approval by the International Paper Board of Directors, receipt of a tax opinion and the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. No assurance can be given regarding the form that a spin-off transaction may take or the specific terms or timing thereof, or that a spin-off will in fact occur. In addition, International Paper expects to retain up to 19.9% of the shares of\nSpinCo at the time of the separation, with the intent to monetize in the future and provide additional proceeds to International Paper. No assurance can be given that we will be able to monetize the shares of SpinCo at a favorable price or at all, or the timing thereof.\nInternational Paper and SpinCo may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits, including cost savings, from the separation on the expected timeframe or at all. As independent publicly-traded companies, International Paper and SpinCo will be smaller, less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, such as changes in the industrial packaging or printing papers industry, which could result in increased volatility in their respective cash flows, working capital and financing requirements and could materially and adversely affect the respective business, financial condition and results of operations. In connection with the transaction, SpinCo is expected to pay International Paper a dividend to be used to pay down outstanding International Paper indebtedness. There can be no assurance that SpinCo will be able to pay a dividend, the amount of any such dividend, or that any dividend paid will be sufficient to repay the amount of indebtedness expected. Further, there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of International Paper\u2019s common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.\nMoreover, substantial expenses will be incurred in connection with the transaction. Such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from the transaction may be offset by costs or delays incurred in effectuating the transaction. Executing the proposed transaction will require significant time and attention from International Paper\u2019s senior management and employees, which could disrupt International Paper\u2019s ongoing business and adversely affect the financial results and results of operations.\nWE MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, DIVESTITURES, CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND OTHER CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS THAT WE HAVE PURSUED OR MAY PURSUE. Our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, capital investments and other corporate transactions that we may pursue and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions, and we are subject to the risk that we may not\nachieve the expected benefits. This failure could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets, which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net earnings. Among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or access to new markets (or a combination thereof), and in the case of divestitures, the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does International Paper.\nCorporate transactions of this nature which we may pursue involve a number of special risks, including with respect to our inability to realize our business goals with respect to such transactions as noted above, the focus of our management\u2019s attention on these transactions and the assimilation of acquired businesses into our operations, the demands on our financial, operational and information technology systems resulting from acquired businesses, and the possibility that we may become responsible for substantial contingent or unanticipated legal liabilities as the result of acquisitions or other corporate transactions.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RISKS RELATED TO BREACHES OF SECURITY PERTAINING TO SENSITIVE COMPANY, CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE AND VENDOR INFORMATION AS WELL AS BREACHES IN THE TECHNOLOGY USED TO MANAGE OPERATIONS AND OTHER BUSINESS PROCESSES. Our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation, updating and independent third party verification, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers or joint venture partners, could become subject to employee error or malfeasance, cyber-attacks, such as ransomware and data theft, by common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations or social activist (\"hacktivist\") organizations, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events. Network, system, application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with International Paper. Access to applications required to plan our operations, source materials, manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused. Theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company,\nemployee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents. Any of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, business delays, negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business.\nRISKS RELATING TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE VARIETY OF LAWS, REGULATIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY CHANGE IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS, AND THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and other government requirements -- including, among others, those relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, data privacy, tax, trade and health care. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and government requirements will not be changed, applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs.\nFor example, we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our environmental expenditures include, among other areas, those related to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater, including situations where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party. Moreover, we may be directly impacted by, and are working to manage, the risks and costs to us, our customers and our vendors of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, and the availability of energy and water resources. These risks include the potentially adverse impact on forestlands, which are a key resource in the production of our products, increased product costs and a change in the types of products that customers purchase. We also face risks arising from the increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging and waste, deforestation, and land use. These risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets, or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them. These risks could expose us to market, operational, and execution costs or risks. There can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and\nrequirements will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. We could also incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.\nOur global operations subject us to complex and evolving U.S and international privacy laws and regulations, such as General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), Brazil's Lei Geral de Pnote\u00e7\u0101o de Dados (\"LGPD\") and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) and the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"). These laws require the Company to comply with a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. These are significant penalties for non-compliance including monetary fines, disruption of operations and reputational harm. Moreover, governmental authorities around the world are considering, or are in the process of implementing new data protection regulations.\nMany of these laws and regulations are subject to uncertain application, interpretation or enforcement standards that could result in claims, changes to our business practices, data processing and security systems, penalties, increased operating costs or other impacts on our businesses. The recently enacted laws often provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as private rights of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. IP proactively uses internal and external resources to monitor compliance with relevant legislation and continually evaluates and, where necessary, modifies its data processing practices and policies in order to comply with evolving privacy laws. Nevertheless, relevant regulatory authorities could determine that our data handling practices fail to address all the requirements of certain new laws, which could subject us to penalties and/or litigation. In addition, there is no assurance that our security controls over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and the policies, procedures and practices we implemented or may implement in the future will prevent the improper disclosure of personal data. Improper disclosure of personal data in violation of the GDPR, the CCPA and/or of other personal data protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer\nconfidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.\nAs a final example, the application of tax law is subject to interpretation and is subject to audit by taxing authorities. Additionally, administrative guidance can be incomplete or vary from legislative intent, and therefore the application of the tax law is uncertain. While we believe the positions reported by the Company comply with relevant tax laws and regulations, taxing authorities could interpret our application of certain laws and regulations differently. We are currently subject to tax audits in the U.S., Brazil, Poland, Russia and other taxing jurisdictions around the world. In some cases, we have appealed and may continue to appeal, assessments by taxing authorities in the court system. As such, tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses, higher future tax expenses or the assessment of interest and penalties.\nRESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS. We are a party to various legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters, including with respect to environmental matters. In addition, we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. Should an unfavorable outcome occur in connection with our legal, regulatory or governmental proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if we become subject to any such loss contingencies in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nIF THE SPIN-OFF WERE TO FAIL TO QUALIFY FOR NON-RECOGNITION TREATMENT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, THEN INTERNATIONAL PAPER, SPINCO AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. International Paper intends to receive an opinion of tax counsel, to the effect that the spin-off and certain related transactions will qualify as tax-free to SpinCo, International Paper and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A tax opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. In addition, International Paper\u2019s tax counsel will rely on certain representations and covenants delivered by International Paper and SpinCo in rendering such opinion. International Paper may also pursue a private letter ruling from the IRS to\nthe effect that the spin-off and certain related transactions will qualify as tax-free to International Paper, SpinCo and International Paper shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf the IRS ultimately determines that the spin-off is taxable, then the spin-off could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to the International Paper shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, International Paper could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and SpinCo may be required to indemnify International Paper for such tax liability pursuant to a tax matters agreement. There can be no assurance that SpinCo would have the resources or liquidity required to indemnify International Paper for any such tax liability.\nEven if the spin-off otherwise qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss under Internal Revenue Code (\"the Code\") Section 355 of the Code, the spin-off may be taxable to International Paper (but not International Paper\u2019s shareholders) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there is a 50% or more (by vote or value) change in ownership of either International Paper or SpinCo, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spin-off. For this purpose, any acquisitions of International Paper\u2019s or SpinCo\u2019s common stock within two years before or after the spin-off are presumed to be part of such a plan, although International Paper or SpinCo may be able to rebut that presumption based on either applicable facts and circumstances or a \u201csafe harbor\u201d described in the U.S. income tax regulations.", "PERMNO": 21573, "SIC": 2631, "TIC": "IP"}
