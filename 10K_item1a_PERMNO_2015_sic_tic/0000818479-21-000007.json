Risk Factors\nSummary\nThe following is a summary of the significant risk factors that could materially impact Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business, financial condition or future results, including risks related to COVID-19, risks related to our businesses, risks related to our international operations, risks related to our regulatory environments, risks related to ownership of our common stock, and general risks:\n\u2022The Company\u2019s revenue, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak\n\u2022The Company may be unable to execute key strategic activities due to competing priorities and strategies of its distribution partners and other factors, which may result in financial loss and operational inefficiencies.\n\u2022The Company relies heavily on information and technology to operate its business networks, and any cyber-attacks or other disruption to its technology infrastructure or the Internet could harm the Company\u2019s operations.\n\u2022Ineffective internal controls and lack of global standardized processes and/or centralization of transaction management and/or execution could result in control deficiencies and impact management\u2019s assertions and financial reporting.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s ongoing business operations may be disrupted for a significant period of time, resulting in material operating costs and financial losses.\n\u2022The success of our business depends in part on achieving our strategic objectives, including through acquisitions and dispositions.\n\u2022The Company may fail to realize the expected benefits of its strategic initiatives, including its announced cost reduction and restructuring efforts.\n\u2022The Company may be unable to develop innovative products.\n\u2022The Company recognized substantial goodwill impairment charges in 2017, 2018, and 2020 and may be required to recognize additional goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the future.\n\u2022Dentsply Sirona\u2019s failure to obtain issued patents and, consequently, to protect Dentsply Sirona\u2019s proprietary technology could hurt Dentsply Sirona\u2019s competitive position.\n\u2022Dentsply Sirona\u2019s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property rights or if Dentsply Sirona's products are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.\n\u2022Changes in the Company\u2019s credit ratings or macroeconomic impacts on credit markets may increase our cost of capital and limit financing options.\n\u2022Dentsply Sirona has a significant amount of indebtedness. A breach of the covenants under Dentsply Sirona\u2019s debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement.\n\u2022The Company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that it does not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debts and cross default provisions may be triggered due to a breach of loan covenants.\n\u2022Dentsply Sirona hedging and cash management transactions may expose Dentsply Sirona to loss or limit Dentsply Sirona\u2019s potential gains.\n\u2022Certain of the Company\u2019s products are dependent on consumer discretionary spending.\n\u2022Due to the Company\u2019s international operations, the Company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\u2022Due to the international nature of our business, including increasing exposure to markets outside of the U.S. and Europe, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance.\n\u2022Dentsply Sirona may be unable to obtain necessary product approvals and marketing clearances.\n\u2022Inadequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or other third-party payors for procedures using Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products may cause Dentsply Sirona\u2019s revenue to decline.\n\u2022Challenges may be asserted against the Company\u2019s products due to real or perceived quality, health or environmental issues.\n\u2022Changes in or interpretations of tax rules, operating structures, transfer pricing regulations, country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the Company\u2019s effective tax rates.\n\u2022If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to Dentsply Sirona\u2019s operations, which could adversely affect Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business.\n\u2022Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business is subject to extensive, complex and changing domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, directives, circulars and orders that failure to comply with which, if not complied with, could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s quarterly operating results and market price for the Company\u2019s common stock may continue to be volatile.\n\u2022Certain provisions in the Company\u2019s governing documents, and of Delaware law, may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Dentsply Sirona.\n\u2022Talent gaps and failure to manage and retain top talent may impact the Company\u2019s ability to grow the business.\n\u2022The Company faces the inherent risk of litigation and claims.\n\u2022The Company\u2019s results could be negatively impacted by a natural disaster or similar event.\nBelow is a full description of each of such significant risk factors.\nRISKS RELATED TO COVID-19\nThe Company\u2019s revenue, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe Company is closely monitoring the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the recent resurgence of infections, which has a significant negative effect, and is expected to continue to have a significant negative effect on, revenue, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity. As a result of the global outbreak of COVID-19, which has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, certain actions are being taken by governmental authorities and private enterprises globally to control the outbreak, including restrictions on public gatherings, travel and commercial operations, temporary closures or decreased operations of dental offices, as well as certain government mandates to limit certain dental procedures to those that could be considered emergency only. These measures, as well as guidance from professional dental associations recommending practitioners only perform emergency procedures, and the impact of COVID-19 generally, may result in, or continue to result in:\n\u2022continuing or new partial or country-wide business lockdowns in various markets;\n\u2022temporary closures or significantly reduced operations at most of the Company\u2019s principal manufacturing and distribution locations, including furloughing employees related to these locations, which could reduce the Company\u2019s ability to manufacture and deliver products to customers;\n\u2022global reductions in customer demand for certain of the Company\u2019s products and services;\n\u2022uncertainty concerning vaccine efficacy and deployment;\n\u2022fear of exposure to or actual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries where operations or customers are located and may lead to decreased procedures at dental offices. The impacts include, but are not limited to, significant reductions or volatility in demand and increased pricing pressures for one or more of the Company's products;\n\u2022decreased financial viability of the Company\u2019s suppliers, which could cause them to change the terms on which they are willing to provide products;\n\u2022the inability or failure of customers to timely meet payment obligations or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties, which may have a negative material impact on the Company's cash flow, liquidity and statements of operations;\n\u2022a recession or prolonged period of economic slowdown, which may significantly reduce the Company\u2019s cash flow and negatively impact the cost and access to capital and funding sources for the Company;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s inability to maintain compliance with covenants under the revolving credit facilities; or\n\u2022the reduced availability of key employees or members of management due to quarantine or illness as a result of COVID-19 may temporarily affect the financial performance and results of operations. If the Company is unable to mitigate these or other similar risks, its business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe Company does not yet know the full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on its business, operations, or the global economy. Given the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is very difficult to predict the severity of the impact on the Company\u2019s business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, including the efficacy and availability of the COVID-19 vaccinations, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty, including new information which may emerge concerning the spread and severity of outbreak and actions taken to address its impact, among others. There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of the COVID-19. To the extent that the COVID-19 outbreak continues to adversely affect the business and financial performance, it also could heighten many of the other risks described in this report.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES\nThe Company may be unable to execute key strategic activities due to competing priorities and strategies of its distribution partners and other factors, which may result in financial loss and operational inefficiencies.\nAs part of the restructuring plan adopted in November 2018, the Company announced that it intends to grow revenues, expand margins and simplify the business. The Company continues to generate a substantial portion of its revenue through a limited number of distributors which provide important sales, distribution and service support to the end-user customers. The Company's two largest distributors, Patterson and Henry Schein, accounted for approximately 24% of the Company\u2019s annual revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, and it is anticipated that they will continue to be the largest distribution contributors to Dentsply Sirona\u2019s revenue through 2021. The Company may be unable to execute its key strategic activities and investments due to the competing priorities of its distribution partners which may introduce competing private label, generic, or low cost products that compete with the Company\u2019s products at lower price points, particularly in the Technologies & Equipment segment products that are sold and serviced through distributor channels. If these competing products capture significant market share or result in a decrease in market prices overall, this could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, some parts of the dental market continue to be impacted by price competition which are driven in part by the consolidation of dental practices, innovation and product advancements, and the price sensitivity of end user customers. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s distribution partners will purchase any specified minimum quantity of products from the Company or that they will continue to purchase any products at all. If Patterson or Henry Schein ceases to purchase a significant volume of products from Dentsply Sirona, or if changes in the Company\u2019s promotional strategies and investments result in changes in the Company\u2019s distributor relationships or short-term uneven growth, it could have a material adverse effect on Dentsply Sirona\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies in part on its dealer and customer relationships and predictions of dealer and customer inventory levels in projecting future demand levels and financial results. These inventory levels may fluctuate, and may differ from the Company\u2019s predictions, resulting in the Company\u2019s projections of future results being different than expected. These changes may be influenced by changing relationships with the dealers and customers, economic conditions and customer preference for particular products. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s dealers and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with the Company\u2019s predictions or past history, or that the timing of customers\u2019 inventory build or liquidation will be in accordance with the Company\u2019s predictions or past history.\nThe Company relies heavily on information and technology to operate its business networks, and any cyber-attacks or other disruption to its technology infrastructure or the Internet could harm the Company\u2019s operations.\nDue to the global nature of the Company\u2019s business and reliance on information systems to provide the Company\u2019s services, the Company uses web-enabled and other integrated information systems in delivering the Company\u2019s services. As the breadth and complexity of Company\u2019s information systems continue to grow, the Company will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development, integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems, including:\n\u2022disruption, impairment or failure of data centers, telecommunications facilities or other key infrastructure platforms;\n\u2022security breaches of, cyberattacks on and other failures or malfunctions in our critical application systems or their associated hardware; and\n\u2022excessive costs, excessive delays or other deficiencies in systems development and deployment.\nAny disruption to the Internet or to the Company\u2019s or its service providers\u2019 global technology infrastructure, including malware, insecure coding, \u201cActs of God,\u201d cyber-attacks and other attempts to penetrate networks, data leakage and human error, could pose a threat to the Company\u2019s operations. The Company\u2019s network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions and the Company may be the victim of cyber-attacks, targeted at the theft of financial assets, intellectual property, employee information, personal information of individuals and customers, or other sensitive information. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Like other large, global companies, the Company has experienced and expects to continue to experience cyber threats from time to time. For example, in January 2020, the Company experienced a phishing cyber-attack that propagated itself to certain of the Company's servers, however there was no evidence of data access, manipulation or exfiltration. Although no such cyber-attacks have had a material adverse effect on the Company to date, the Company cannot provide assurance that, despite the Company\u2019s efforts to ensure the integrity of the Company\u2019s systems and the measures that the Company or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats, a future cyber-attack would not result in material harm to the Company or its business and results of operations, particularly as cyber-threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against. For example, certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of the Company\u2019s information could compromise intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks could also cause the Company to incur significant remediation costs, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources.\nThe materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data and the day-to-day management of the Company\u2019s business and could result in the corruption, loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary, confidential or other data. Disaster recovery plans, where in place, might not adequately protect the Company in the event of a system failure. Further, the Company currently does not have excess or standby computer processing or network capacity everywhere in the world to avoid disruption in the receipt, processing and delivery of data in the event of a system failure. Despite any precautions the Company take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the Company\u2019s servers.\nAny of the foregoing incidents could also subject the Company to liability, expose the Company to significant expense, or cause significant harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which could result in lost revenues. While Dentsply Sirona has invested and continues to invest in information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans, these measures cannot fully insulate the Company from cyber-attacks, technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and financial results.\nIneffective internal controls and lack of global standardized processes and/or centralization of transaction management and/or execution could result in control deficiencies and impact management\u2019s assertions and financial reporting.\nThe Company\u2019s implementation of its business plans, restructuring plans and compliance with regulations requires that Dentsply Sirona effectively manage its financial infrastructure, including standardizing processes, maintaining proper financial reporting and internal controls. During this period of restructuring and organizational changes, the Company continues to focus on standardizing its processes, improving its financial systems, maintaining effective internal controls and centralizing transaction management and/or execution so as to provide continued assurance with respect to the Company's financial reports, support the continued growth of the business, and prevent financial misstatement or fraud. Non-standardized processes and ineffective controls could result in an inability to aggregate and analyze data in a timely and accurate manner and may lead to inaccurate or incomplete financial and management reporting and delays in financial reporting to management, regulators and/or shareholders. For example, the Company was unable to file its Annual Reports on Form 10-K for its fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 within the respectively prescribed time periods due to factors such as impairment triggering events, the estimation of the income tax impact related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, management turnover, and the review of internal controls of an immaterial business which was being shut down. Inaccurate or incomplete financial reporting and disclosures could also result in noncompliance with applicable business and regulatory requirements and the incurring of related penalties.\nAdditionally, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or omissions because of certain limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. As a result, even effective internal controls may not provide reasonable assurances with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become either obsolete or inadequate as a result of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If Dentsply Sirona fails to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if Dentsply Sirona experiences difficulties in implementing new or revised controls, Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business and operating results could be harmed and Dentsply Sirona could fail to meet Dentsply Sirona\u2019s reporting obligations.\nFurther, the Company currently has disparate systems, including enterprise resource planning systems, across the organization which may result in the potential inability to obtain and analyze business data and increases in budgets due to higher costs stemming from system upgrades, and may pose business partner connection challenges. As a result, the data required to manage the business may not be complete, accurate or consistent, resulting in the potential for misleading or inaccurate reporting for key business decisions. Additionally, the structure of the organization may not be aligned to support the strategic business objectives which could result in potential operational deficiencies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business relationships and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ongoing business operations may be disrupted for a significant period of time, resulting in material operating costs and financial losses.\nThe Company operates in more than 120 countries and the Company\u2019s and its suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world. Potential events such as extreme weather, natural disasters, worker strikes and social and political actions, such as Brexit and trade wars, or other events beyond our control, could impact the Company\u2019s ongoing business operations, including potential critical third-party vendor disruptions or failure to adhere to contractual obligations affecting our supply chain and manufacturing needs or the loss of critical information technology and telecommunications systems. Although the Company maintains multiple manufacturing facilities, a large number of the products manufactured by the Company are manufactured in facilities that are the sole source of such products. As there are a limited number of alternative suppliers for these products, any disruption at a particular Company manufacturing facility could lead to delays, increased expenses, and may damage the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner, such events could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results.\nAdditionally, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s injectable anesthetic products, orthodontic products, certain dental cutting instruments, catheters, nickel titanium products and certain other products and raw materials are purchased from a limited number of suppliers and in certain cases single source suppliers pursuant to agreements that are subject to periodic renewal, some of which may also compete with the Company. As there are a limited number of suppliers for these products, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products and raw materials in the future. Any delays in delivery of or shortages in these products could interrupt and delay manufacturing of the Company\u2019s products and result in the cancellation of orders for these products. In addition, these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these products to the Company at any time or supply products to competitors. Dentsply Sirona may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all. Any transition to alternate suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products to customers.\nThe success of our business depends in part on achieving our strategic objectives, including through acquisitions and dispositions.\nWith respect to acquisitions and dispositions of assets and businesses, the Company may not achieve expected returns and other benefits associated with business combinations as a result of various factors, including integration and collaboration challenges, such as personnel and technology. In addition, the Company may not achieve anticipated synergies from related integration activities. For example, following the merger of DENTSPLY International Inc. and Sirona Dental Systems, Inc. in 2016, the combined Company recorded an aggregate of $3.3 billion in charges for the impairment of certain businesses and in 2018 announced significant cost reduction and restructuring efforts.\nFurther, acquisitions or dispositions may distract the Company\u2019s management\u2019s time and attention and disrupt our ongoing business operations or relationships with customers, employees, suppliers or other parties. However, the Company continues to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help the Company achieve its strategic objectives, and to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy.\nAfter reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business, the transaction may remain subject to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms as well as the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, which may prevent the Company from completing the transaction in a timely manner, or at all. From a workforce perspective, risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions include, among others, delays in anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected, negative impacts on the Company\u2019s relationship with labor unions, adverse effects on employee morale, and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair the Company\u2019s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business, and could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nWhen the Company decides to sell assets or a business, the Company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the accomplishment of its strategic objectives. Alternatively, the Company may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than the Company had anticipated, or with the exclusion of assets that must be divested or run off separately. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in a divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, transition service agreements, guarantees, indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the acquired or divested business, or other conditions outside the Company\u2019s control, could affect its future financial results.\nIn the context of acquisitions, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management\u2019s attention from normal business operations. The Company may not achieve the full revenue growth expectations and cost synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition. For example, the Company acquired Byte on December 31, 2020 for approximately $1.0 billion. The success of the Company's acquisition of Byte depends upon its ability to realize anticipated benefits which may not be realized on a timely basis, or at all, for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022challenges due to expanding into a new customer base through the direct-to-consumer channel;\n\u2022the effect of future regulatory or legislative actions on the Company or the industries and market segments in which it operates;\n\u2022the ability to hire and retain key personnel;\n\u2022continued support of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products by influential dental and medical professionals;\n\u2022the potential impact on relationships with customers, suppliers, competitors, management and other employees;\n\u2022unexpected challenges related to scaling the operations;\n\u2022the continued strength of the clear aligner market; and\n\u2022unexpected changes or increased expenses relating to competitive factors in the clear aligner market;\nAdditionally, if the Company makes acquisitions, it may incur debt, assume contingent liabilities and/or additional risks, or create additional expenses, any of which might adversely affect its financial results. Any financing that the Company might need for acquisitions may only be available on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results.\nThe Company may fail to realize the expected benefits of its strategic initiatives, including its announced cost reduction and restructuring efforts.\nIn order to operate more efficiently and control costs, the Company has announced in the past, and may announce in the future, restructuring plans or other major initiatives from time to time, including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives that are intended to generate operating expense or cost of goods sold savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings. The failure to efficiently execute such initiatives as part of the Company\u2019s business strategy could minimize the expected benefits to the organization resulting in potential impacts to ongoing operations and cost overruns.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions and other factors that we may not be able to control. The Company may also incur significant charges related to restructuring plans, which would reduce our profitability in the periods such charges are incurred. Consistent with these efforts, in November 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to restructure and simplify the Company\u2019s business. The goal of this restructuring is to drive annualized net sales growth of 3% to 4% and adjusted operating income margins of 22% by the end of 2022 as well as achieve net annual cost savings of $200 million to $225 million by 2021. In July 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an expansion of this plan that is intended to further optimize the Company\u2019s product portfolio and reduces operating expenses. The product portfolio optimization has resulted in the divestiture or closure of certain underperforming businesses. The operating expense reductions will come as a result of additional leverage from continued integration and simplification of the business. As part of this expanded plan, the Company announced on August 6, 2020 that it will exit its traditional orthodontics business as well as both exit and restructure certain portions of its laboratory business. The Company had initially anticipated one-time expenditures and charges of approximately $275 million yielding annual cost savings of $200 million to $225 million by 2021. The program expansion is expected to result in total charges of approximately $375 million and annual cost savings of approximately $250 million. The Company expects that these expanded actions will result in incremental global headcount reductions of 6% to 7% in addition to the original projections of 6% to 8%. Since November 2018, the Company has incurred expenditures of approximately $310 million under this program, of which, approximately $120 million were non-cash charges.\nDue to the complexities inherent in implementing these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities, and the quarterly phasing of related investments, the Company may fail to realize expected efficiencies and benefits, such as the goals for net sales growth, adjusted operating income margins, and cost savings, or may experience a delay in realizing such efficiencies and benefits, and its operations and business could be disrupted. Company management may be required to divert their focus to managing these disruptions, and implementation may require the agreement of third parties, such as labor unions or works councils. Risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected, negative impact on the Company\u2019s relationship with labor unions or works councils, adverse effects on employee morale, and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair the Company\u2019s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business, and could have a material adverse effect on its sales growth, operating income margins and other results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, or competitive position.\nThe Company may be unable to develop innovative products.\nThe worldwide markets for dental and medical products is highly competitive and is driven by rapid and significant technological change, change in consumer preferences, new intellectual property associated with that technological change, evolving industry standards, and new product introductions. Additionally, some markets for products are also subject to significant negative price pressures. Dentsply Sirona\u2019s patent portfolio continues to change with patents expiring through the normal course of their life. There can be no assurance that Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products will not lose their competitive advantage or become noncompetitive or obsolete as a result of such factors, or that we will be able to generate any economic return on the Company\u2019s investment in product development.\nIf the Company fails to further develop its innovation efforts or if the Company\u2019s research and development does not effectively respond to changes in consumer preferences or market competition leading to technology or product obsolescence, the Company may lose market share and revenue. Additionally, if the Company\u2019s products or technologies lose their competitive advantage or become noncompetitive or obsolete, Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business could be negatively affected. Dentsply Sirona has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities.\nAdditionally, there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors\u2019 new products will not be introduced that could render the Company\u2019s products obsolete.\nThe Company recognized substantial goodwill impairment charges in 2017, 2018, and 2020 and may be required to recognize additional goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the future.\nThe Company acquires other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. The Company reviews amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually. The valuation models used to determine the fair value of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management's best estimates. The Company's significant assumption in the valuation models include but are not limited to, discount rates, revenue growth rates, perpetual revenue growth rates, and operating margin percentages of the business. Any changes to the assumption and estimates made by management may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived assets in our reporting unit may not be recoverable.\nDuring 2017, 2018, and 2020 the Company had recorded an aggregate of $3.5 billion in charges for the impairment of certain businesses:\n\u2022In connection with the Company\u2019s April 30, 2017 annual goodwill impairment test and the preparation of the financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded a $1,093 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with the CAD/CAM, Imaging and Treatment Center equipment businesses. In addition, the Company tested the indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the CAD/CAM and Imaging businesses and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired, resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of $80 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.\n\u2022In preparing the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company identified a triggering event and recorded a $558 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with the CAD/CAM, Imaging and Treatment Center businesses. In addition, the Company tested the indefinite-lived intangible assets related to these businesses and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired, resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of $267 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\n\u2022In connection with the Company\u2019s April 30, 2018 annual goodwill impairment test and the preparation of the financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded a $1,086 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with the CAD/CAM and Imaging equipment businesses and the Orthodontics business. In addition, the Company tested the indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the equipment businesses and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired, resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of $179 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018.\n\u2022In preparing the financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company identified a triggering event and recorded a $157 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with the Equipment & Instruments reporting unit within the Technologies & Equipment segment. In addition, the Company tested the indefinite-lived intangible assets related to these business and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired, resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of $39 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.\nThe goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used, such as discount rates, revenue growth rates, perpetual revenue growth rates, and operating margin percentages of the business as well as current market conditions affecting the dental and medical device industries in both the U.S. and globally, all of which have been unfavorably impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If the assumptions and projections used in the analysis are not realized, it is possible that an additional impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. Given the uncertainty in the marketplace and other factors affecting management\u2019s assumptions underlying the Company\u2019s discounted cash flow model, the Company\u2019s current estimates could vary significantly in the future, which may result in a goodwill impairment charge at that time. Additionally, valuations and impairments that are not complete, accurate, timely or appropriately recorded could result in potential financial misstatements and delays in impairment analysis.\nSee Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s failure to obtain issued patents and, consequently, to protect Dentsply Sirona\u2019s proprietary technology could hurt Dentsply Sirona\u2019s competitive position.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s success will depend in part on Dentsply Sirona\u2019s ability to obtain and enforce claims in our patents directed to Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products, technologies and processes, both in the United States and in other countries. Risks and uncertainties that Dentsply Sirona faces with respect to Dentsply Sirona\u2019s patents and patent applications include the following:\n\u2022the pending patent applications that Dentsply Sirona has filed, or to which Dentsply Sirona has exclusive rights, may not result in issued patents or may take longer than Dentsply Sirona expects to result in issued patents;\n\u2022the allowed claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u2022Dentsply Sirona may be unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022the patents licensed or issued to Dentsply Sirona may not provide a competitive advantage;\n\u2022other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to Dentsply Sirona;\n\u2022disputes may arise regarding inventions and corresponding ownership rights in inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by Dentsply Sirona and Dentsply Sirona\u2019s respective licensors; and\n\u2022other companies may design around the technologies patented by Dentsply Sirona.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property rights or if Dentsply Sirona's products are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property rights or misappropriate Dentsply Sirona\u2019s technologies and trademarks for their own businesses. To protect Dentsply Sirona\u2019s rights to Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property, Dentsply Sirona relies on a combination of patent and trademark law, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and contractual arrangements with Dentsply Sirona\u2019s employees, strategic partners and others. Dentsply Sirona cannot assure you that any of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s patents, any of the patents of which Dentsply Sirona are a licensee or any patents which may be issued to Dentsply Sirona or which we may license in the future, will provide Dentsply Sirona with a competitive advantage or afford Dentsply Sirona protection against infringement by others, or that the patents will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties, including Dentsply Sirona\u2019s competitors. The protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s proprietary information. Dentsply Sirona may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property rights. Effective patent, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which Dentsply Sirona will offer, or intend to offer, Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products. Any failure to adequately protect Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property could devalue Dentsply Sirona\u2019s proprietary content and impair Dentsply Sirona\u2019s ability to compete effectively. Further, defending Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.\nLitigation may also be necessary to enforce Dentsply Sirona\u2019s intellectual property rights or to defend against any claims of infringement of rights owned by third parties that are asserted against Dentsply Sirona. In addition, Dentsply Sirona may have to participate in one or more interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office or other foreign patent governing authorities, to determine the priority of inventions, which could result in substantial costs. Acquisitions by Dentsply Sirona of products or businesses that are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and the resulting changes to the competitive landscape of the industry could further increase this risk.\nIf Dentsply Sirona becomes involved in litigation or interference proceedings, Dentsply Sirona may incur substantial expense, and the proceedings may divert the attention of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s technical and management personnel, even if Dentsply Sirona ultimately prevails. An adverse determination in proceedings of this type could subject us to significant liabilities, allow Dentsply Sirona\u2019s competitors to market competitive products without obtaining a license from Dentsply Sirona, prohibit Dentsply Sirona from marketing Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products or require us to seek licenses from third parties that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If Dentsply Sirona cannot obtain such licenses, Dentsply Sirona may be restricted or prevented from commercializing Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products.\nThe enforcement, defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s, the European Patent Office\u2019s and other foreign patent offices\u2019 interference proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings in the United States and elsewhere, involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, these proceedings are costly and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain. Litigation may be necessary to:\n\u2022assert against others or defend Dentsply Sirona against claims of patent or trademark infringement;\n\u2022enforce patents owned by, or licensed to Dentsply Sirona from, another party;\n\u2022protect Dentsply Sirona\u2019s trade secrets or know-how; or\n\u2022determine the enforceability, scope and validity of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others.\nChanges in the Company\u2019s credit ratings or macroeconomic impacts on credit markets, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may increase our cost of capital and limit financing options.\nThe Company utilizes the short and long-term debt markets to obtain capital from time to time. The Company\u2019s continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the condition of global credit markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, operating performance, and credit ratings. Macroeconomic conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may have resulted in significant disruption in the credit markets, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capital-intensive internal initiatives.\nOn March 30, 2020, S&P Global Ratings affirmed our then credit rating, but changed the outlook to negative from stable. Future adverse changes in our credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities which may in turn limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. There is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future to fund obligations, or that it will be available on commercially reasonable terms, in which case we may need to seek other sources of funding. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.\nDentsply Sirona has a significant amount of indebtedness. A breach of the covenants under Dentsply Sirona\u2019s debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement.\nThe Company has debt securities outstanding of approximately $2.3 billion. Dentsply Sirona also has the ability to incur up to $700 million of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility (\"2018 Credit Facility\"), as discussed below, and may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s level of indebtedness and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for the Company to satisfy its obligations with respect to its indebtedness;\n\u2022requiring Dentsply Sirona to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, which would reduce the funds the Company has available for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; and\n\u2022reducing Dentsply Sirona\u2019s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and market conditions.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s current debt agreements contain a number of covenants and financial ratios, which the Company is required to satisfy. Under the Note Purchase Agreement dated December 11, 2015, the Company will be required to maintain ratios of debt outstanding to total capital not to exceed the ratio of 0.6 to 1.0, and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 3.0 times, in each case, as such terms are defined in the Note Purchase Agreement. All of the Company\u2019s outstanding debt agreements have been amended to reflect these covenants. The Company may need to reduce the amount of its indebtedness outstanding from time to time in order to comply with such ratios, though no assurance can be given that Dentsply Sirona will be able to do so. Dentsply Sirona\u2019s failure to maintain such ratios or a breach of the other covenants under its debt agreements outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness.\nThe Company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that it does not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debts and cross default provisions may be triggered due to a breach of loan covenants.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations, and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control. Although senior management believes that the Company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity, there can be no assurance that Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt, pay its contractual obligations and operate its business.\nAdditionally, Dentsply Sirona\u2019s existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios, which it is required to satisfy. Any breach of any such covenants or restrictions, the most restrictive of which pertain to asset dispositions, maintenance of certain levels of net worth, and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense, would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and, through cross-default provisions, would entitle Dentsply Sirona\u2019s other lenders to accelerate their loans. Dentsply Sirona may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross-default provisions are triggered or to the extent that no other parties are willing to extend financing.\nDentsply Sirona hedging and cash management transactions may expose Dentsply Sirona to loss or limit Dentsply Sirona\u2019s potential gains.\nAs part of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s risk management program, we use foreign currency exchange forward contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, these transactions may limit Dentsply Sirona\u2019s potential gains or expose Dentsply Sirona to loss. Should Dentsply Sirona\u2019s counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.\nWe enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. Although we do not enter into these instruments for trading purposes or speculation, and although Dentsply Sirona\u2019s management believes all of these instruments are economically effective for accounting purposes as hedges of underlying physical transactions, these foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by Dentsply Sirona\u2019s counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in Dentsply Sirona having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.\nWe enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage some of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s exposure to interest rate volatility. These swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing Dentsply Sirona\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates. If such events occur, Dentsply Sirona\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMost of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s cash deposited with banks is not insured and would be subject to the risk of bank failure. Dentsply Sirona\u2019s total liquidity also depends in part on the availability of funds under Dentsply Sirona\u2019s 2018 Credit Facility. The failure of any bank in which we deposit Dentsply Sirona\u2019s funds or that is part of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s 2018 Credit Facility could reduce the amount of cash we have available for operations and additional investments in Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s products are dependent on consumer discretionary spending.\nCertain dental specialty products and dental equipment and related products that support discretionary dental procedures may be susceptible to unfavorable changes in economic conditions. Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could negatively affect the Company's business and result in a decline in sales and financial performance.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS\nDue to the Company\u2019s international operations, the Company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates.\nDue to the international nature of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business, movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations, consolidated balance sheets and cash flows of the Company. With approximately two-thirds of the Company\u2019s sales located outside the U.S., the Company\u2019s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the U.S. dollar as compared to certain foreign currencies. Additionally, movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity as a number of the Company\u2019s manufacturing and distribution operations are located outside of the U.S. Changes in exchange rates may have a negative effect on the underlying strength of particular economies and dental markets. Although the Company currently uses and may in the future use certain financial instruments to attempt to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that they will not create additional financial obligations on the Company.\nDue to the international nature of our business, including increasing exposure to markets outside of the U.S. and Europe, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance.\nApproximately two-thirds of the Company\u2019s sales are located in regions outside the United States. In addition, we anticipate that sales outside of the U.S. and Europe will continue to expand and account for a significant portion of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s revenue. Operating internationally is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022economic and political instability;\n\u2022import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022additional compliance-related risks;\n\u2022trade restrictions and tariffs;\n\u2022product registration requirements;\n\u2022longer payment cycles;\n\u2022changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022trade policy changes\nSpecifically, changes in or the imposition of tariffs could make it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to other countries. These measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the United States. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold. We cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers and our suppliers, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of these risks may be heightened as a result of changing political climates, both of which may lead to changes in areas such as trade restrictions and tariffs, regulatory requirements and exchange rate fluctuations, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS\nDentsply Sirona may be unable to obtain necessary product approvals and marketing clearances.\nDentsply Sirona must obtain certain approvals by, and marketing clearances from, governmental authorities, including the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries to market and sell Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products in those countries. These agencies regulate the marketing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, advertising, sale and distribution of medical devices. The FDA enforces additional regulations regarding the safety of X-ray emitting devices. Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products are currently regulated by such authorities and certain of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s new products will require approval by, or marketing clearance from, various governmental authorities, including the FDA. Various states also impose similar regulations.\nThe FDA review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products. A 510(k) application is required in order to market certain classes of new or modified medical devices. If specifically required by the FDA, a pre-market approval, or PMA, may be necessary. Such proceedings, which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device, are potentially expensive and time consuming. They may delay or hinder a product\u2019s timely entry into the marketplace. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the review or approval process for these products by the FDA or any other applicable governmental authority will occur in a timely fashion, if at all, or that additional regulations will not be adopted or current regulations amended in such a manner as will adversely affect us. The FDA also oversees the content of advertising and marketing materials relating to medical devices which have received FDA clearance. Failure to comply with the FDA\u2019s advertising guidelines may result in the imposition of penalties.\nWe are also subject to other federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted and inadequate employee training for critical compliance and regulatory requirements may result in the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules and regulations.\nSimilar to the FDA review process, the EU review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products. Such proceedings, which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device, are potentially expensive and time consuming and may delay or prevent a product\u2019s entry into the marketplace.\nThe Company\u2019s products will need to be certified under the European Medical Directive that has been revised to become the Medical Device Regulation (\u201cMDR\u201d). Dentsply Sirona as well as all medical device manufacturers have to perform significant upgrades to quality systems and processes including technical documentation and subject them to new certification under MDR in order to continue to sell those products in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). The effectiveness of the new regulations, originally scheduled to take effect in May 2020, have been delayed for one year until May 2021. However, failure to have the upgrades to quality systems and processes completed by May 2021 could unfavorably impact the Company\u2019s sales and financial condition. Additionally, the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) has negotiated an exit from the EU, \"Brexit\" and, as a result, the EU CE marking will be recognized in the UK through June 2023. Following June 2023, the UK may impose its own differing regulatory requirements for products being imported from the EU into the UK.\nFailure to comply with these rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse impact on Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business. Also, these regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require Dentsply Sirona to make changes in Dentsply Sirona\u2019s operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial, regulatory authorities, increasing compliance risks.\nInadequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or other third-party payors for procedures using Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products may cause Dentsply Sirona\u2019s revenue to decline.\nThird-party payors, including government health administration authorities, private health care insurers and other organizations regulate the reimbursement of fees related to certain diagnostic procedures or medical treatments. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. While Dentsply Sirona cannot predict what effect the policies of government entities and other third-party payors will have on future sales of our products, there can be no assurance that such policies would not cause Dentsply Sirona\u2019s revenue to decline.\nChallenges may be asserted against the Company\u2019s products due to real or perceived quality, health or environmental issues.\nThe Company manufactures and sells a wide portfolio of dental and medical device products. While the Company endeavors to ensure that its products are safe and effective, there can be no assurance that there may not be challenges from time to time regarding the real or perceived quality, health or environmental impact of the Company\u2019s products or certain raw material components of the Company\u2019s products. All dental amalgam filling materials, including those manufactured and sold by Dentsply Sirona, contain mercury. Some groups have asserted that amalgam should be discontinued because of its mercury content and/or that disposal of mercury containing products may be harmful to the environment. In the United States, the EPA proposed in September 2014 certain effluent limitation guidelines and standards under the Clean Water Act to help cut discharges of mercury-containing dental amalgam to the environment. The rule would require affected dentists to use best available technology (amalgam separators) and other best management practices to control mercury discharges to publicly-owned treatment works. Similar regulations exist in Europe and in February 2016, the European Union adopted a ratification package regarding the United Nations Minamata Convention on Mercury, proposing rules restricting the use of dental amalgam to the encapsulated form and requiring the use of separators by dentists. In September 2020, the FDA issued an updated recommendation that certain people are at higher risk for health problems from mercury-containing amalgam dental fillings, such as pregnant women and their developing fetuses, women who are planning to become pregnant, nursing women and their newborns and infants, children, especially those younger than six years of age, people with pre-existing neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, or Parkinson disease, people with impaired kidney function, and people with a known allergy to mercury or other components of dental amalgam. If governmental authorities elect to place restrictions or significant regulations on the sale and/or disposal of dental amalgam, that could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s sales of dental amalgam. Dentsply Sirona also manufactures and sells non-amalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury but that may contain bisphenol-A, commonly called BPA. BPA is found in many everyday items, such as plastic bottles, foods, detergents and toys, and may be found in certain dental composite materials or sealants either as a by-product of other ingredients that have degraded, or as a trace material left over from the manufacture of other ingredients used in such composites or sealants. The FDA currently allows the use of BPA in dental materials, medical devices, and food packaging. Nevertheless, public reports and concerns regarding the potential hazards of dental amalgam or of BPA could contribute to a perceived safety risk for the Company\u2019s products that contain mercury or BPA. Adverse publicity about the quality or safety of our products, whether or not ultimately based on fact, may have an adverse effect on our brand, reputation and operating results and legal and regulatory developments in this area may lead to litigation and/or product limitations or discontinuation.\nChanges in or interpretations of tax rules, operating structures, transfer pricing regulations, country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the Company\u2019s effective tax rates.\nAs a company with international operations, we are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income-based taxes, in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable at the time made, the actual outcome could differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements (and such differences may be material). If the IRS, or other taxing authority, disagrees with the positions we take, we could have additional tax liability, and this could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations, and changes in interpretations of tax laws. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change.\nOur corporate structure, which is subject to modification, is intended to enhance our operational and financial efficiency and increase our overall profitability. The tax authorities of the countries in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for transfer pricing which could increase our effective tax rate (and such increase may be material). In addition, certain governments are considering, and may adopt, tax reform measures that could significantly increase our worldwide tax liabilities. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and other government bodies have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations, including, in the area of \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting,\u201d where payments are made from affiliates in jurisdictions with high tax rates to affiliates in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. It is possible that these reform measures could increase our effective tax rate (and such increase may be material) and impact our financial position.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to Dentsply Sirona\u2019s operations, which could adversely affect Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business.\nDentsply Sirona is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders relating to health care fraud, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act 2010 (c.23), Brazil\u2019s Clean Company Act 2014 (Law No. 12,846) and China's National Health and Family Planning Commission (\u201cNHFPC\u201d) circulars No. 49 and No. 50. Some of these laws, referred to as \u201cfalse claims laws,\u201d prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payors and programs. Other laws, referred to as \u201canti-kickback laws,\u201d prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payors and programs.\nThe U.S. government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other. As a result, we regularly review and revise Dentsply Sirona\u2019s marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance. In addition, under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act and similar foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders, such as France\u2019s Loi Bertrand and rules issued by Denmark\u2019s Health and Medicines Authority, the general public and government officials will be provided with access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals) by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations, which includes us. This information may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs.\nFailure to comply with health care fraud laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse impact on Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business. Also, these laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require Dentsply Sirona to make changes in Dentsply Sirona\u2019s operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial, regulatory authorities, increasing compliance risks.\nWe cannot predict whether changes in applicable laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders, or the interpretation thereof, or changes in Dentsply Sirona\u2019s services or marketing practices in response, could adversely affect Dentsply Sirona\u2019s business.\nDentsply Sirona\u2019s business is subject to extensive, complex and changing domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, directives, circulars and orders that failure to comply with which, if not complied with, could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities.\nDentsply Sirona is subject to extensive domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders which are administered by various international, federal and state governmental authorities, including, among others, the FDA, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (\u201cOFAC\u201d), the Bureau of Industry and Security of the United States Department of Commerce (\u201cBIS\u201d), the United States Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d), and other similar domestic and foreign authorities. These laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders include, but are not limited to, the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the European Council Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices (\u201cMDD\u201d) (1993) (and implementing and local measures adopted thereunder), the Federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH Act\u201d), the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), France\u2019s Data Protection Act of 1978 (rev. 2004), the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar international anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, regulations concerning the supply of conflict minerals, various environmental regulations such as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the \u201cClean Water Act\u201d), the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the \u201cHealth Care Reform Law\u201d), and regulations relating to trade, import and export controls and economic sanctions. Such laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders are complex and are subject to change. For example, since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially affect the regulatory regime applicable to our operations and customers with operations connected to the United Kingdom. Any such changes to the regulatory regime could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nCompliance with the numerous applicable existing and new laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders could require us to incur substantial regulatory compliance costs. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not raise compliance concerns or perform audits to confirm compliance with such laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders. Failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars or orders could result in a range of governmental enforcement actions, including fines or penalties, injunctions and/or criminal or other civil proceedings. Any such actions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly operating results and market price for the Company\u2019s common stock may continue to be volatile.\nDentsply Sirona experiences significant fluctuations in quarterly sales and earnings due to a number of factors, some of which are substantially outside of the Company\u2019s control, including but not limited to:\n\u2022the execution of the Company\u2019s restructuring plan;\n\u2022the complexity of the Company\u2019s organization;\n\u2022the timing of new product introductions by Dentsply Sirona and its competitors;\n\u2022the timing of industry trade shows;\n\u2022changes in customer inventory levels;\n\u2022developments in government or third party payor reimbursement policies;\n\u2022changes in customer preferences and product mix;\n\u2022the Company\u2019s ability to supply products to meet customer demand;\n\u2022fluctuations in manufacturing costs;\n\u2022changes in income tax laws and incentives which could create adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022competitors\u2019 sales promotions;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022general economic conditions, as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries.\nAs a result, the Company may fail to meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts, which could cause its stock price to decline. Quarterly fluctuations generally result in net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters. The Company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year. These price changes, other marketing and promotional programs, which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business, the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives, may impact sales levels in a given period. Net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters, primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding these quarters, but also due to the impact of holidays and vacations, particularly throughout Europe.\nCertain provisions in the Company\u2019s governing documents, and of Delaware law, may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Dentsply Sirona.\nCertain provisions of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and of Delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of Dentsply Sirona. Such provisions include, among others, a provision allowing the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend Dentsply Sirona\u2019s By-laws and prevent them from calling special meetings of stockholders. Delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the Company and any \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d with beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock.\nGENERAL RISKS\nTalent gaps and failure to manage and retain top talent may impact the Company\u2019s ability to grow the business.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage its human capital through talent acquisition, engagement, development, and retention. To achieve the Company\u2019s strategic initiatives, the Company needs to attract, manage, and retain employees with the right skills, competencies and experiences to support the growth of the business and the failure to attract and retain such employees to fill key roles may adversely affect our business performance, competitive position and future prospects. The Company also must retain a pipeline of team members to provide for continuity of succession for senior executive positions. In order to attract and retain qualified employees, the Company must offer competitive compensation and effectively manage employee performance and development. Our inability to attract and retain talent may negatively impact business continuity, new product launches, and innovation initiatives. Further, such organizational challenges may make it difficult to maintain the Company\u2019s culture, resulting in employees not adhering to the desired values of the organization.\nThe Company faces the inherent risk of litigation and claims.\nThe Company faces the risk of purported securities class actions, investigations by governmental agencies, product liability and other types of legal actions or claims, including possible recall actions affecting the Company\u2019s products. In December 2020, the Company and the SEC entered into a settlement pursuant to which the Company neither admitted nor denied the SEC\u2019s findings (except as to the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction), the Company agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder, and pay a $1 million civil penalty. However, the primary civil litigation which the Company currently faces involve various putative class action suits in federal and state court alleging that the Company and certain of its present and former officers and directors violated U.S. securities laws by allegedly making false and misleading statements in connection with a February 2016 registration statement issued in connection with the merger with former Sirona Dental Systems, Inc. by the entity formerly known as Dentsply International Inc., and in connection with the Company's regular securities filings or public statements, and to lawsuits related to the products manufactured by the Company. The Company has insurance policies, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance and product liability insurance, covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate; however, the Company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. Also, other types of claims asserted against the Company may not be covered by insurance. A successful claim brought against the Company in excess of available insurance, or another type of claim which is uninsured or that results in significant adverse publicity against the Company, could harm its business and overall cash flows of the Company.\nVarious parties, including the Company, own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental and medical device fields. Although the Company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property rights, it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the Company\u2019s products infringe upon such party\u2019s intellectual property and force the Company to pay damages and/or discontinue the sale of certain products.\nAdditionally, Dentsply Sirona generally warrants each of Dentsply Sirona\u2019s products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of shipment or installation plus any extended warranty period purchased by the customer. The future costs associated with providing product warranties could be material. Successful product warranty claims brought against Dentsply Sirona could reduce Dentsply Sirona\u2019s profits and/or impair our financial condition, and damage Dentsply Sirona\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s results could be negatively impacted by a natural disaster or similar event.\nThe Company operates in more than 120 countries and its and its suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world. Any natural or other disaster in such a location could result in serious harm to the Company\u2019s business and consolidated statements of operations. Any insurance maintained by the Company may not be adequate to cover losses resulting from such disasters or other business interruptions, and emergency response plans may not be effective in preventing or minimizing losses in the future.", "PERMNO": 11600, "SIC": 3843, "TIC": "XRAY"}
