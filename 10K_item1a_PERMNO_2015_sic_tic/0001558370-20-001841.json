RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.\nRisks Affecting All of Our Businesses\nThe Company may be unable to integrate successfully the business of NRC and realize the anticipated benefits of the NRC Merger\nOn November 1, 2019, the Company closed the NRC Merger. The success of the NRC Merger depends, in large part, on the ability of the Company to realize the anticipated benefits, including cost savings, from combining the businesses of the Company and NRC. Prior to the acquisition of NRC, the Company had never pursued an acquisition of comparable size or complexity. To realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses of the Company and NRC must be integrated successfully. This integration is complex and time consuming. The failure to successfully integrate and manage the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined company not fully achieving the anticipated benefits of the NRC Merger. Any failure to timely realize these anticipated benefits would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition, and could also have a material and adverse effect on the trading price or trading volume of our common stock. Potential difficulties the Company may encounter as part of the integration process, many of which may be beyond the control of management, include the following:\n\u25cf the inability to successfully combine the businesses of the Company and NRC in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the full synergies anticipated to result from the NRC Merger;\n\u25cf complexities and unanticipated issues associated with managing the combined businesses, including the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks, financial procedures, communications programs and other assets, procedures or policies of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers and other constituencies;\n\u25cf coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing a larger combined company, addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures, maintaining employee morale and management philosophies and retaining key personnel;\n\u25cf unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u25cf integrating the workforces of the two companies while maintaining focus on achieving strategic initiatives;\n\u25cf the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;\n\u25cf potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased or new expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the NRC Merger;\n\u25cf consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations;\n\u25cf the increase in our leverage and debt service requirements in connection with the NRC Merger could restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed, result in a decrease in our credit rating, or limit our ability to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;\n\u25cf managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company; and\n\u25cf making any necessary modifications to internal financial control standards to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nIn addition, US Ecology and NRC operated independently prior to the closing of the NRC Merger. It is possible that the integration process could result in:\n\u25cf ongoing diversion of the attention of each company\u2019s management and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters;\n\u25cf latent impacts resulting from the diversion of the Company\u2019s management team from ongoing business concerns as a result of the devotion of management\u2019s attention to the integration process;\n\u25cf disruption of existing relationships with customers and suppliers;\n\u25cf an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities and business operations of the Company, which could seriously harm the results of operations; and\n\u25cf inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the Company ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or the Company\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the NRC Merger, or which could adversely affect the business and financial results of the Company.\nThe Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, substantial expenses related to the NRC Merger and the integration of the Company and NRC.\nThe Company expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with the NRC Merger and the integration of the Company and NRC. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including purchasing, accounting, finance and payroll. While the Company and has assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, there are many factors beyond its control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. These integration expenses likely will result in the combined company taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the NRC Merger, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.\nThe completion of, loss of or failure to renew one or more significant contracts could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe provide disposal and transportation services to customers on discrete Event Business projects (non-recurring project-based work) which vary widely in size, duration and unit pricing. Some of these multi-year projects can account for a significant portion of our revenue and profit. The replacement of Event Business revenue and earnings depends on multiple factors, many of which are outside of our control including, but not limited to, general and industry-specific economic conditions, capital in the commercial credit markets, general level of government funding on environmental matters, real estate development and other industrial investment opportunities. Our inability to replace the revenue from Event Business projects with new business could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur market is highly competitive. Failure to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition from companies with greater resources than us, companies with closer geographic proximity to waste sites, service offerings we do not provide and that can provide lower pricing than we can in certain instances. An increase in the number or location of commercial treatment or disposal facilities for hazardous or radioactive waste, significant expansion of existing competitor permitted capabilities, acquisitions by competitors or a decrease in the treatment or disposal fees charged by competitors could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Our business is also\nheavily affected by waste disposal fees imposed by government agencies. These fees, which vary from state to state and are periodically adjusted, may adversely impact the competitive environment in which we operate.\nAdverse economic conditions, government funding or competitive pressures affecting our customers could harm our business.\nWe serve oil refineries, chemical production plants, steel mills, real estate developers, waste brokers/aggregators serving small manufacturers and other industrial customers that are, or may be, affected by changing economic conditions and competition. These customers may be significantly impacted by deterioration in the general economy and may curtail waste production and/or delay spending on plant maintenance, waste cleanup projects and other discretionary work. Spending by government customers may also be reduced or temporarily suspended due to declining tax revenues that may result from a general deterioration in economic conditions or other federal or state fiscal policy. Factors that can impact general economic conditions and the level of spending by customers include the general level of consumer and industrial spending, increases in fuel and energy costs, residential and commercial real estate and mortgage market conditions, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting spending behavior. Market forces may also compel customers to cease or reduce operations, declare bankruptcy, liquidate or relocate to other countries, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are significantly affected by the commencement and completion of large and small cleanup projects, potential seasonal fluctuations due to weather, budgetary decisions and cash flow limitations influencing the timing of customer spending for remedial activities, the timing of regulatory agency decisions and judicial proceedings, changes in government regulations and enforcement policies and other factors that may delay or cause the cancellation of cleanup projects. We do not control such factors, which can cause our revenue and income to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations our business could be adversely affected.\nThe changing regulatory framework governing our business creates significant risks. We could be held liable if our operations cause contamination of air, groundwater or soil or expose our employees or the public to contamination. Under current law, we may be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved. Also, we may be liable if we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination at facilities operated by others, or if a predecessor made such arrangements and we are a successor. Liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nStringent regulations of federal, state or provincial governments have a substantial impact on our business. Local government controls may also apply. Many complex laws, rules, orders and regulatory interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety, noise, visual impact, odor, land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. Failure to obtain on a timely basis or comply with applicable federal, state, provincial and local governmental regulations, licenses, permits or approvals for our waste treatment and disposal facilities could prevent or restrict our ability to provide certain services, resulting in a potentially significant loss of revenue and earnings. Changes in environmental regulations may require us to make significant capital or other expenditures, or limit operations. Changes in laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws, regulations or permitted activities may require us to modify existing operating licenses or permits, or obtain additional approvals or limit operations. New governmental requirements that raise compliance standards or require changes in operating practices or technology may impose significant costs and/or limit operations.\nOur revenue is primarily generated as a result of requirements imposed on our customers under federal, state, and provincial laws and regulations to protect public health and the environment. If requirements to comply with laws and regulations governing management of PCB, hazardous or radioactive waste were relaxed or less vigorously enforced, demand for our services could materially decrease and our revenues and earnings could be significantly reduced.\nWe could incur liability, including under environmental laws, rules and regulations, in connection with providing spill response services.\nWe may incur increased legal fees and costs in connection with providing spill response services. Although the services provided by us are generally exempt in the United States from liability under the CWA, this exemption might not apply to our own actions and omissions in providing spill response services if we are found to have been grossly negligent or to have engaged in willful misconduct, or if we have failed to provide these services consistent with applicable regulations and directives under the CWA. In addition, the exemption under the federal CWA would not protect a company against liability for personal injury or wrongful death, or against prosecution under other federal or state laws. Although most of the states within the United States in which we provide services have adopted similar exemptions, several states have not. If a court or other applicable authority were to determine that we do not benefit from federal or state exemptions from liability in providing emergency response services, we could be liable, together with the local contractor and the responsible party, for any resulting damages, including damages caused by others. In the international market, we do not benefit from the spill response liability protection provided by the CWA and therefore are subject to the liability terms and conditions negotiated with our international clients.\nIf Congress repeals the exemption to liability for responders that is discussed above, or otherwise scales back the protections afforded to contractors thereunder, there may be increased exposure for remediation work and the cost for securing insurance for such work may become prohibitively expensive. In addition, more generally Congress could increase or remove the limits of liability currently in place under OPA 90 for facilities and vessels. Without affordable insurance and appropriate legislative regulation limiting liability, drilling, exploration, remediation and further investment in oil and gas exploration in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico may be discouraged and thus reduce the demand for our services.\nWe could incur liability under environmental laws, rules and regulations in connection with providing waste disposal services.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to fault or knowledge of contamination. In the past, practices have resulted in releases of regulated materials at and from certain of our facilities, or the disposal of regulated materials at third-party sites, which require investigation and remediation and may potentially result in claims of personal injury, property damage and damages to natural resources. In addition, we occasionally evaluate various alternatives with respect to our facilities, including possible dispositions or closures. Investigations undertaken in connection with these activities may lead to discoveries of contamination that must be remediated, and closures of facilities might trigger compliance requirements that are not applicable to operating facilities. We are currently conducting remedial activities at certain of our facilities and paying a portion of the remediation costs at certain sites owned by third parties. Based on available information, we believe these remedial activities will not result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, result of operations and cash flows. However, these activities or the discovery of previously unknown conditions could result in material costs.\nIn addition, we are required to obtain governmental permits to provide our services, operate our facilities, including all of our landfills, and expand our operations. Although we are committed to compliance and safety, we may not, either now or in the future, be in full compliance at all times with such laws, rules and regulatory requirements or be able to renew or procure governmental permits. As a result, we could be required to incur significant costs to maintain or improve our compliance with such requirements. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations may also result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations.\nFrom time to time, we have paid fines or penalties in governmental environmental enforcement proceedings, usually involving our waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities. Although none of these fines or penalties has had a material adverse effect upon us, we might in the future be required to make substantial expenditures as a result of governmental proceedings which would have a negative impact on our earnings. Furthermore, regulators have the power to suspend or revoke permits or licenses needed for operation of our plants, equipment and vehicles based on, among other factors, our compliance record. Suspension or revocation of permits or licenses would impact our operations and could have a material impact on our financial results.\nExisting or future laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and climate change could have an impact on our business and may result in additional compliance obligations on us and our customers.\nChanges in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gases and climate change may impact demand for our services. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements, including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns. However, increased environmental requirements could also increase demand for our services. Local, state and federal agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business. To a certain extent our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have an impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nWe could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and our reputation could be adversely affected, if our businesses, or third parties with whom we have a relationship, were to fail to comply with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations.\nSome of our projects and business may be conducted in countries where corruption has historically been prevalent. It is our policy to comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and with applicable local laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, and we monitor our local partners\u2019 compliance with such laws as well. Our reputation may be adversely affected if we were reported to be associated with corrupt practices or if we failed to comply with such laws. Such damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. Additionally, violations of such laws could subject us to significant fines and penalties.\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations relating to our securities, including rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments, including non-U.S. governments, relating to our securities. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable securities laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAn accident at any one of our facilities may result in significant litigation or the imposition of fines as a result of regulatory investigations, as well as the loss of business, profits or customers, which may not be fully covered by our insurance policies.\nOn November 17, 2018, an explosion occurred at our Grand View, Idaho facility, resulting in one employee fatality and injuries to other employees. The incident severely damaged the facility\u2019s primary waste-treatment building as well as surrounding waste handling, waste storage, maintenance and administrative support structures, resulting in the closure of the entire facility that remained in effect through January 2019. We resumed limited operations at our Grand View, Idaho facility in February 2019 and regained additional capabilities throughout the remainder of 2019. On January 10, 2020, we entered into a settlement agreement with OSHA settling a complaint made by OSHA relating to the incident for $50,000. On January 28, 2020, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission issued an order terminating the proceeding relating to such OSHA complaint. We have not otherwise been named as a defendant in any third-party action relating to the incident. We maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance, business interruption insurance and liability insurance for personal injury, property and casualty damage. We believe that any potential third-party claims associated with the explosion, in excess of our deductibles, are expected to be resolved primarily through our insurance policies. Although we carry business interruption insurance, a disruption of our business caused by a casualty event, including the full and partial closure of our Grand View, Idaho facility, may result in the loss of business, profits or customers during the time of such closure. Accordingly, our insurance policies may not fully compensate us for these losses.\nOur business requires the handling of dangerous substances. Improper handling of such substances could result in an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to unexpected occurrences related, or unrelated, to the routine handling of dangerous substances. A fire or other incident could impair the ability of one or more facilities to continue to perform normal operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Improper handling of these substances could also violate laws and regulations resulting in fines and/or suspension of operations.\nFailure to maintain an acceptable safety record may have an adverse impact on our ability to retain and acquire customers.\nOur current and prospective customers consider safety and reliability a primary concern in selecting a service provider. We must maintain a record of safety and reliability that is acceptable to our customers. Should this not be achieved, our ability to retain current customers and attract new customers may be adversely affected.\nFailure to realize the anticipated benefits and operational performance from previously acquired operations could lead to an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.\nAs a result of acquisitions since 2010, including our acquisition of NRC in 2019, we have goodwill of $767.0 million, non-amortizing intangible assets of $103.9 million and amortizing intangible assets of $471.0 million at December 31, 2019. We are required to test goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine if impairment has occurred. We are also required to test goodwill and intangible assets if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including potential changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in laws or regulations, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in our stock price and market capitalization. Changes in these factors, or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance, may affect the fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may result in an impairment charge.\nEstimates of the future performance of our reporting units assume a certain level of revenue and earnings growth over the projection period. The projected revenue and earnings growth is based on various factors and assumptions that we consider to be reasonable, including, but not limited to, growth in the industries served by the Field Services reporting unit, successful implementation of our business and marketing strategies for this reporting unit and continuing favorable market conditions for the customers we serve. Should any of these assumptions turn out to be false and the projected growth not occur for these or other reasons, the reporting units otherwise fail to meet their current financial plans or there are changes to any other key assumptions used in the estimates, the financial performance of these reporting units could result in a future goodwill impairment.\nWe cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired as a result of a failure to realize the anticipated benefits and operational performance of acquired operations, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nFailure to perform under our contracts may adversely harm our business.\nCertain contracts require us to meet specified performance criteria. Our ability to meet these criteria requires that we expend significant resources. If we or our subcontractors are unable to perform as required, we could be subject to substantial monetary penalties and/or loss of the affected contracts which may adversely affect our business.\nOur participation in multi-employer pension plans may subject us to liabilities that could materially adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiaries participate in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements covering most of the subsidiaries\u2019 union employees. To the extent that those\nplans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (\u201cERISA\u201d), may subject us to substantial liabilities if we withdraw from such multi-employer plans or if they are terminated. Under current law regarding multi-employer defined benefit plans, a plan\u2019s termination, an employer\u2019s voluntary partial or complete withdrawal from or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from, an underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plan requires participating employers to make payments to the plan for their proportionate share of the multi-employer plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities. Furthermore, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201cseriously endangered,\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status. If plans in which we participate are in critical status, benefit reductions may apply and/or we could be required to make additional contributions. Contributions to these funds could also increase as a result of future collective bargaining with the unions, a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency of other companies who currently contribute to these funds, failure of the plan to meet ERISA\u2019s minimum funding requirements, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets, or other funding deficiencies. Any of the foregoing events could materially adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nBased upon the information available to us from plan administrators as of April 30, 2019, certain of the multi-employer pension plans in which we participate are underfunded. The Pension Protection Act requires that underfunded pension plans improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding. In addition, if a multi-employer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5% on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing to the fund. We have been notified that certain plans to which our subsidiaries contribute are in \u201ccritical\u201d status and these plans may require additional contributions in the form of a surcharge on future benefit contributions required for future work performed by union employees covered by these plans. As a result, we expect our required contributions to these plans to increase in the future. The amount of additional funds we may be obligated to contribute in the future cannot be estimated, as such amounts will be based on future levels of work that require the specific use of the union employees covered by these plans, investment returns and the level of underfunding of such plans.\nWe may experience risks from our international operations.\nOur ability to compete in the international market may be adversely affected by foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors, or that require non-U.S. Citizens to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. Further, our foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally imposed restrictions on their ability to transfer funds to their parent company. Activity outside the United States involves additional risks, including the possibility of:\n\u25cf United States embargoes or restrictive actions by U.S. and foreign governments that could limit our ability to provide services in foreign countries\u037e\n\u25cf a change in, or the imposition of, withholding or other taxes on foreign income, tariffs or restrictions on foreign trade and investment\u037e\n\u25cf limitations on the repatriation of earnings or currency exchange controls and import/export quotas\u037e\n\u25cf local cabotage and local ownership laws and requirements\u037e\n\u25cf nationalization, expropriation, asset seizure, blockades and blacklisting\u037e\n\u25cf limitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage\u037e\n\u25cf loss of contract rights and inability to enforce contracts\u037e\n\u25cf political instability, war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets, such as terrorist attacks, piracy and kidnapping\u037e\n\u25cf the impact of public health epidemics like the coronavirus which originated in the Wuhan region of China;\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange that affect demand for our services and profitability\u037e\n\u25cf potential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010\u037e\n\u25cf labor strikes and volatility in labor costs\u037e\n\u25cf changes in general economic and political conditions\u037e and\n\u25cf difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations.\nIn addition, to the extent that we use a non-U.S. currency as a functional currency in a particular territory, we are exposed to fluctuations in the value of such currency. In addition, risks related to our activities outside of the United states include the repatriation of cash to the United States and the imposition of additional taxes on our foreign income.\nMoreover, our business is also impacted by the negotiation and implementation of free trade agreements between the United States and other countries. Such agreements can reduce barriers to international trade and thus the cost of conducting business overseas. For instance, the United States recently reached a new trilateral trade agreement with the governments of Canada and Mexico to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d). If the United States withdraws from NAFTA and the three countries fail to approve the new agreements, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, our cost of doing business within the three countries could increase.\nAny of the foregoing or other factors associated with doing business abroad could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to U.S. tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on the markets and industries we serve and, in turn, harm us.\nRecently, there have been significant changes to U.S. trade policies, treaties and tariffs, which have resulted in uncertain economic and political conditions that have made it difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. For example, the U.S. has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S. from China, the European Union and other countries, and could impose additional tariffs or trade restrictions. Such changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy and have resulted in certain retaliatory trade measures and tariffs implemented by other countries. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of our customers, which in turn could negatively impact us.\nFluctuations in the commodity market related to the demand and production of oil, gas and other energy-related commodities may affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nDeclines in the production level of oil, gas and other energy-related commodities could have significant adverse effects on us. Commodity demand fluctuates for several reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in market and economic conditions, the impact of weather, levels of domestic and international production, domestic and foreign governmental regulation, national protectionism policies and trade disputes. Volatility of commodity demand, which may lead to a reduction in production or supply of the commodity, may negatively impact the demand for our services. A decline in the demand for these services may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA change in, or revocation of, our classification as an OSRO could result in a loss of business.\nNRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is classified by the USCG as an OSRO. The USCG classifies OSROs based on their overall ability to respond to various types and sizes of oil spills. USCG-classified OSROs have a competitive advantage over non-classified service providers because customers of a classified OSRO may cite classified OSROs in their response plans in lieu of listing their oil spill response resources in filings with the USCG. A loss of our classification or changes in the requirements for classification could eliminate or diminish our ability to provide customers with this exemption. If this happens, our Field & Industrial Service segment could lose customers.\nA cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers.\nWe use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers. Such uses of technology give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers\u2019 personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about the Company and its business partners. Further, if the Company in the future pursues acquisitions or new initiatives that require expanding or improving our information technologies, this may result in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Further, despite these security measures, the Company\u2019s computer systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective, and our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Costs for insurance may also increase as a result of security threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nCybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated. We rely extensively on information technology systems, including internet sites, computer software, data hosting facilities and other hardware and platforms, some of which are hosted by third parties, to assist in conducting our business. Our technologies systems may become the target of cybersecurity attacks, including without limitation malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems and materially and adversely affect us in a variety of ways: the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those tax laws, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Additionally, our effective tax rate may be affected by the tax effects of acquisitions or restructuring activities we may undertake, changes in share-based compensation, newly enacted tax legislation and uncertain tax positions we may take in the short term in response to such legislation. Finally, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities which may result in the assessment of additional income taxes. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. However, unanticipated outcomes from examinations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The U.S. recently enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. If the U.S. or foreign\ntax authorities of jurisdictions within which we operate change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nLoss of key management or sales personnel could harm our business.\nWe have an experienced management team including general managers at our operating facilities and rely on the continued service of these senior managers to achieve our objectives. Our objective is to retain our present management and sales teams and identify, hire, train, motivate and retain other highly skilled personnel. The loss of any key management employee or sales personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA change or deterioration in labor relations could disrupt our business or increase costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 523, or approximately 14%, of our employees. While we believe the Company will maintain good working relations with its employees on acceptable terms, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the terms of future agreements in a manner acceptable to the Company. Potential work disruptions from labor disputes may disrupt our businesses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party contractors to provide important emergency response services to our customers.\nWe rely on independent contractors to provide services and support to our customers. While the use of independent contractors expands the reach and customer base for our services, the maintenance and administration of these relationships is costly and time consuming. If we do not enter into arrangements with these independent contractors on financially acceptable terms, these relationships may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditional Risks of Our Environmental Services Business\nOur energy waste business could be adversely affected by changes in laws regulating energy waste.\nWe believe that the demand for our energy waste services is directly related to the regulation of energy waste. In particular, RCRA, which governs the disposal of solid and hazardous waste, currently exempts certain energy wastes from classification as hazardous wastes. In recent years, proposals have been made to rescind this exemption from RCRA. If the exemption covering energy wastes is repealed or modified, or if the regulations interpreting the rules regarding the treatment or disposal of this type of waste were changed, our operations could face significantly more stringent regulations, permitting requirements, and other restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, if new federal, state, provincial or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly for our customers to perform fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could reduce our customers\u2019 oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and, therefore, adversely affect our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business by more strictly regulating how hydraulic fracturing wastes are handled or disposed. Conversely, any loosening of existing federal, state, provincial or local laws or regulations regarding how such wastes are handled or disposed could adversely impact demand for our services.\nLower crude oil prices may adversely affect the level of exploration, development and production activity of energy companies and the demand for our energy waste services.\nLower crude oil prices and the volatility of such prices may affect the level of investment and the amount of linear feet drilled in the basins where we operate, as it may impact the ability of energy companies to access capital on economically advantageous terms or at all. In addition, energy companies may elect to decrease investment in basins where the returns on investment are inadequate or uncertain due to lower crude oil prices or volatility in crude oil prices. Such reductions in\ncapital spending would negatively impact energy waste generation and therefore the demand for our services. Further, we cannot provide assurances that higher crude oil prices will result in increased capital spending and linear feet drilled by our customers in the basins where we operate.\nIf we are unable to obtain at a reasonable cost or under reasonable terms and conditions the necessary levels of insurance and financial assurances required for operations, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe are required by law, license, permit and prudence to maintain various insurance instruments and financial assurances. We carry a broad range of insurance coverage, including general liability, automobile liability, real and personal property, workers compensation, directors and officers liability, environmental impairment liability, business interruption and other coverage customary for a company of our size in our business. We purchase primary property, casualty and excess liability policies through traditional third-party insurance carriers to mitigate risk of loss. We are self-insured for employee healthcare coverage. Stop-loss insurance is carried covering liability on claims in excess of $300,000 per individual. Accrued costs related to the self-insured healthcare coverage were $1.0 million and $826,000 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. If our insurers were unable to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims were more than expected, there could be a material adverse effect to our financial condition and results of operation.\nThrough December 31, 2019, we have met our financial assurance requirements through a combination of insurance policies, commercial surety bonds and trust funds. Our insurance policies covering closure and post-closure activities expire in December 2020 for covered U.S. operating facilities (dedicated state-controlled closure and post-closure funds provide financial assurance for our Washington and Nevada facilities). We continue to use self-funded trust accounts for our post-closure obligations at our U.S. non-operating sites. We use commercial surety bonds for our Canadian operations that expire in November and December 2020 and for our Texas energy waste landfills that expire in May 2020 and February 2021. We currently have in place all financial assurance instruments necessary for our operations. While we expect to continue renewing these policies and surety bonds, if we were unable to obtain adequate closure, post-closure or environmental insurance, bonds or other instruments in the future, any partially or completely uninsured claim against us, if successful and of sufficient magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, continued access to casualty and pollution legal liability insurance with sufficient limits, at acceptable terms, is important to obtaining new business. Failure to maintain adequate financial assurance could also result in regulatory action including early closure of facilities. As of December 31, 2019, we had provided collateral of $5.1 million in funded trust agreements, $23.1 million in surety bonds, issued $3.6 million in letters of credit for financial assurance and have insurance policies of approximately $103.5 million for closure and post-closure obligations at covered U.S. operating facilities. As of December 31, 2019, we have $775,000 in commercial surety bonds dedicated for closure obligations at our Blainville, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada facility.\nWhile we believe we will be able to renew and maintain all our insurance and requisite financial assurance policies at a reasonable cost, premium and collateral requirements may materially increase. Such increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance.\nOur business operations are subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incidental to the handling, storage and disposal of combustible and other hazardous products. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, and severe damage and destruction of property and equipment arising from explosions or other catastrophic events. As a result, we may become a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, environmental contamination could result in future legal proceedings. There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims or that such levels of insurance would be available in the future at economical prices, as described above.\nAlthough we carry business interruption insurance, a disruption of our business caused by a casualty event, including the full and partial closure of our Grand View, Idaho facility (as described herein), may result in the loss of business, profits or customers during the time of such closure. As such, our insurance policies may not fully compensate us for these losses.\nA significant portion of our business depends upon non-recurring event cleanup projects over which we have no control.\nA significant portion of our disposal revenue is attributable to discrete Event Business which varies widely in size, duration and unit pricing. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 22% of our T&D revenue was derived from Event Business projects. The one-time nature of Event Business, diverse spectrum of waste types received and widely varying unit pricing necessarily creates variability in revenue and earnings. This variability may be influenced by general and industry-specific economic conditions, funding availability, changes in laws and regulations, government enforcement actions or court orders, public controversy, litigation, weather, commercial real estate, closed military bases and other project timing, government appropriation and funding cycles and other factors. This variability can cause significant quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year differences in revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating income and net income. Also, while we pursue many large projects months or years in advance of work performance, both large and small cleanup project opportunities routinely arise with little or no prior notice. These market dynamics are inherent to the waste disposal business and are factored into our projections and externally communicated business outlook statements. Our projections combine historical experience with identified sales pipeline opportunities, new or expanded service line projections and prevailing market conditions. A reduction in the number and size of new cleanup projects won to replace completed work could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals and contracts for construction of additional disposal space by the time our current disposal capacity is exhausted, our business would be adversely affected.\nConstruction of new disposal capacity at our operating disposal facilities beyond currently permitted capacity requires state and provincial regulatory agency approvals. Administrative processes for such approval reviews vary. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining future expansion approvals in a timely manner or at all. If we are not successful in receiving these approvals, our disposal capacity could eventually be exhausted, preventing us from accepting additional waste at an affected facility. This would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to renew our operating permits or lease agreements with regulatory bodies, our business would be adversely affected.\nOur facilities operate using permits and licenses issued by various regulatory bodies at various state, provincial and federal government levels. In addition, three of our facilities operate on land that is leased from government agencies. Failure to renew our permits and licenses necessary to operate our facilities or failure to renew or maintain compliance with our site lease agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance we will continue to be successful in obtaining timely permit applications approval, maintaining compliance with our lease agreements and obtaining timely lease renewals.\nWe may not be able to obtain timely or cost-effective transportation services which could adversely affect our profitability.\nRevenue at each of our facilities is subject to potential risks from disruptions in rail or truck transportation services relied upon to deliver waste to our facilities. Increases in fuel or labor costs, shortages of qualified drivers and unforeseen events such as labor disputes, public health pandemics, severe weather, natural disasters and other acts of God, war or terror could prevent or delay shipments and reduce both volumes and revenue. Our rail transportation service agreements with our customers generally allow us to pass on fuel surcharges assessed by the railroads to such customers. This may decrease or eliminate our exposure to fuel cost increases. Transportation services may be limited by economic conditions, including increased demand for rail or trucking services, resulting in periods of slower service to the point that individual customer needs cannot be met. No assurance can be given that we can procure transportation services in a timely manner at competitive rates or pass through fuel cost increases in all cases. Such factors could also limit our ability to achieve revenue and earnings objectives.\nThe hazardous and radioactive waste industries in which we operate are subject to litigation risk.\nThe handling of radioactive, PCBs and hazardous material subjects us to potential liability claims by employees, contractors, property owners, neighbors and others. There can be no assurance that our existing liability insurance is adequate to cover claims asserted against us or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future. Adverse rulings in judicial or administrative proceedings could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to effectively adopt or adapt to new or improved technologies.\nWe expect to continue implementing new or improved technologies at our facilities to meet customer service demands and expand our business. If we are unable to identify and implement new technologies in response to market conditions and customer requirements in a timely, cost-effective manner, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nOur financial results could be adversely affected by foreign exchange fluctuations.\nWe operate in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa but report revenue, costs and earnings in U.S. dollars. In fiscal 2019, we recorded approximately 14% of our revenues outside of the United States. Exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and local currencies are likely to fluctuate from period to period. Because our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, we are subject to the risk of non-cash translation losses for reporting purposes. If we continue to expand our international operations, we will conduct more transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent that foreign revenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the local currency, we are further subject to the risk of transaction losses. We have not entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional Risks of Our Field & Industrial Services Business\nA significant portion of our Field & Industrial Services segment depends upon the demand for cleanup of spills and other remedial projects and regulatory developments over which we have no control.\nA significant portion of our Field & Industrial Services segment consists of remediation, recycling, industrial cleaning and maintenance, transportation, total waste management, technical services, and emergency response services. Demand for these services can be affected by the commencement and completion of cleanup of major spills and other events, customers\u2019 decisions to undertake remedial projects, seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles influencing the timing of customers\u2019 spending for remedial activities, the timing of regulatory decisions relating to hazardous waste management projects, changes in regulations governing the management of hazardous waste, changes in the waste processing industry towards waste minimization and the propensity for delays in the demand for remedial services, and changes in governmental regulations relevant to our diverse operations. We do not control such factors and, as a result, our revenue and income can vary from quarter to quarter or year to year, and past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance.\nAdditional Risks of Completed and Potential Acquisitions\nAcquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition to the risks listed above relating to the NRC Merger, acquisitions by the Company may involve multiple other risks. Our inability to successfully integrate an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. These risks include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf failure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flows;\n\u25cf assumption of liabilities, including those related to environmental matters, that were not disclosed to us or that exceed our estimates;\n\u25cf problems integrating the purchased operations with our own, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;\n\u25cf potential compliance issues relating to the protection of health and the environment, compliance with securities laws and regulations, adequacy of internal controls and other matters;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention or other resources from our existing business;\n\u25cf risks associated with entering markets or product/service areas in which we have limited prior experience;\n\u25cf increases in working capital investment to fund the growth of acquired operations;\n\u25cf unexpected capital expenditures to upgrade waste handling or other infrastructure or replace equipment to operate safely and efficiently;\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company; and\n\u25cf future write-offs of intangible and other assets, including goodwill, if the acquired operations fail to generate sufficient cash flows.\nIf we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized fully, if at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our ongoing business, failure to implement the business plan for the combined businesses, unanticipated issues in integrating service offerings, logistics information, communications and other systems or other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities, any or all of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nIn the event that we undertake future acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy.\nWe may experience delays in making acquisitions or be unable to make the acquisitions we desire for a number of reasons. Suitable acquisition candidates may not be available at purchase prices that are attractive to us or on terms that are acceptable to us. In pursuing acquisition opportunities, we typically compete with other companies, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do. We may not have available funds or common stock with a sufficient market price to complete an acquisition. If we are unable to secure sufficient funding for potential acquisitions, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that we otherwise find advantageous.\nThe timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may cause volatility in our financial results.\nWe are unable to predict the size, timing and number of acquisitions we may complete, if any. In addition, we may incur expenses associated with sourcing, evaluating and negotiating acquisitions (including those that are not completed), and we also may pay fees and expenses associated with financing acquisitions to investment banks and others. Any of these amounts may be substantial, and together with the size, timing and number of acquisitions we pursue, may negatively impact and cause significant volatility in our financial results and the price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to our Capital Structure\nWe may not be able or willing to pay future dividends.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to our future financial condition and certain conditions such as continued compliance with covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. Our Board of Directors must also approve any dividends at their sole\ndiscretion. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, we may only declare quarterly or annual dividends if on the date of declaration, no event of default has occurred and no other event or condition has occurred that would constitute an event of default due to the payment of the dividend. Unforeseen events or situations could cause non-compliance with these covenants, or cause the Board of Directors to discontinue or reduce the amount of any future dividend payment.\nFuture stock issuances could adversely affect common stock ownership interest and rights in comparison with those of other security holders.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or securities convertible into common stock, or we use shares of our common stock to pay a portion of the purchase price in any future acquisition, the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we issue additional common stock or securities convertible into common stock, such issuance would reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of each other stockholder. In addition, such stock issuances might result in a reduction of the book value of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, protective provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201ccharter\u201d) and Amended and Restated Bylaws or the implementation by our Board of Directors of a stockholder rights plan could prevent a takeover, which could harm our stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the public market by certain stockholders may result in significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock and could affect your ability to realize the current trading price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by certain stockholders could cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock. In connection with the closing of the NRC Merger, certain affiliates of JFL-NRC-SES Partners, LLC, the majority stockholder of NRC prior to the closing of the NRC Merger (collectively, the \u201cJFL Entities\u201d), were issued an aggregate of 5,440,798 shares of our common stock. In connection with our entry into the Merger Agreement, Predecessor US Ecology entered into that certain investor agreement, dated June 23, 2019, by and among Predecessor US Ecology, certain affiliates of the JFL Entities and NRC which provided, among other things, that 1/3 of such shares were restricted from resale for a period of 60 days from the closing of the NRC Merger, 1/3 of such shares were restricted from resale for 90 days from the closing of the NRC Merger, and 1/3 of such shares were restricted from resale for 120 days from the closing of the NRC Merger. As of February 29, 2020, the restriction on resale applicable to all of such shares expired. Dispositions of these securities by the JFL Entities may result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock.\nAny significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock as the selling stockholders sell their shares of our common stock could encourage short sales by the selling stockholders or others. Any such short sales could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and this may make it difficult for stockholders to resell shares of common stock at times or may make it difficult for stockholders to sell shares of common stock at prices they find attractive.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in share prices and trading volumes that affect the\nmarket prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates and buy/sell recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u25cf our earnings releases and financial performance;\n\u25cf market conditions in our industry and the general state of the securities markets;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u25cf actions by institutional stockholders;\n\u25cf investor perception of us and the industry and markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf general economic conditions in the United States and Canada;\n\u25cf international disorder and instability in foreign financial markets, including but not limited to potential sovereign defaults; and\n\u25cf other factors described in \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nThere is no guarantee that our warrants will ever be in the money and they may expire worthless.\nThe exercise price for our warrants is $58.67 per share of common stock, subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Warrant Agreement (as defined below). There is no guarantee that the warrants will ever be in the money prior to their expiration, and as such, the warrants may expire worthless. In addition, our warrants were issued to holders of warrants of NRC prior to the NRC Merger in registered form under that certain Assignment, Assumption and Amendment to the Warrant Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2019, by and between US Ecology, Inc., American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, NRC and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the \u201cWarrant Agreement\u201d). The Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then-outstanding warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders.\nIncreases in transportation costs may adversely affect our business and reduce our earnings.\nWe maintain an expansive transportation network and an extensive fleet of transportation vehicles. A significant increase in market prices for vehicles or fuel could adversely affect our business through higher transportation costs and reduce our operating margins and reported earnings.\nOur indebtedness may limit the amount of cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business, and our credit agreement restricts our ability to engage in certain corporate and financial transactions.\nOn April 18, 2017, Predecessor US Ecology entered into a new senior secured credit agreement (as amended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), as administrative agent for the lenders, swingline lender and issuing lender, and Bank of America, N.A., as an issuing lender, that provides for a $500.0 million, five-year revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), including a $75.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $40.0 million sublimit for the issuance of swingline loans used to fund short-term working capital requirements. The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature whereby the Company may request up to $200.0 million of additional funds through an increase to the Revolving Credit Facility, through incremental term loans,\nor some combination thereof. On August 6, 2019 and November 1, 2019, the Credit Agreement was amended to permit and provide for Wells Fargo to lend $450.0 million in incremental terms loans to pay off the existing debt of NRC in connection with the NRC Merger, to pay the fees, costs and expenses in connection with the NRC Merger and to pay down outstanding revolving credit loans under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019, we had total indebtedness of $777.0 million, comprised of $450.0 million of term loans and $327.0 million of revolving credit loans out of a $500.0 million revolving credit commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility. These revolving credit loans are due upon the earliest to occur of (1) November 1, 2024 (or, with respect to any lender, such later date as requested by us and accepted by such lender), (2) the date of termination of the entire revolving credit commitment (as defined in the Credit Agreement) by us and (3) termination of the Credit Agreement. The term loan is due upon the earliest to occur of (a) November 1, 2026 (or, with respect to any lender, such later date as requested by us and accepted by such lender) and (b) termination of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement makes us vulnerable to adverse general economic or industry conditions and increases in interest rates, as borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates, and limits our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital or other purposes.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement and related ancillary agreements with our lenders contain certain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and make other restricted payments, repurchase shares of outstanding stock, create certain liens and engage in certain types of transactions. Our ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement depends upon our compliance with the restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants.\nChanges in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to our debt.\nAmounts drawn under our credit facilities bear interest rates at the election of the borrower, in relation to LIBOR or an alternate base rate. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. Our credit facilities contain certain provisions concerning the possibility that LIBOR may cease to exist, and that an alternative reference rate may be chosen. However, if LIBOR in fact ceases to exist, and no alternative rate is acceptable to the Company or its lenders, amounts drawn under our credit facilities would be subject to the alternate base rate, which may be a higher interest rate than LIBOR which would increase our interest expense. As a result, we may need to renegotiate our credit facilities and may not be able to do so with terms that are favorable to us. The overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market or the inability to renegotiate the credit facility with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nRisks Related to the Jones Act\nOur business would be adversely affected if we failed to comply with the Jones Act\u2019s restrictions on ownership of our capital stock by non-U.S. Citizens.\nA substantial portion of our operations is conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and is subject to the requirements of the Jones Act. The Jones Act restricts waterborne transportation of merchandise and passengers for hire by water or by land and water, either directly or via a foreign port, between points in the United States and certain of its island territories and possessions to U.S.-flag vessels meeting certain requirements, including ownership and control by U.S. Citizens (within the meaning of the Jones Act). We are responsible for monitoring the non-U.S. Citizen ownership of our common stock and other equity interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. We could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of our common stock or other equity interests in us. Such a loss would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Violations of the Jones Act would result in us losing eligibility to engage in the U.S. coastwise trade, the imposition of substantial penalties against us, including fines and seizure and forfeiture of our vessels, and/or the temporary or permanent inability to document our vessels in the United States with coastwise endorsements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we currently believe we meet the\nrequirements to engage in the U.S. coastwise trade, and there are provisions in the charter that were designed to assist us in complying with these requirements, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with the Jones Act in the future.\nRepeal, amendment, suspension or non-enforcement of the Jones Act would result in additional competition for a substantial portion of our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Jones Act, which restricts the transportation of merchandise and passengers for hire by water or by land and water, either directly or via a foreign port, between points in the United States and certain of its island territories and possessions to U.S.-flag vessels that meet certain requirements, including that they are built in the United States and owned by U.S. Citizens (within the meaning of the Jones Act), and manned by predominantly U.S. citizen crews. During the past several years, interest groups have lobbied the U.S. Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act to facilitate foreign-flag vessel competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S.-flag vessels under the Jones Act. We expect that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act. In addition, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security may waive the requirement for using U.S.-flag vessels with coastwise endorsements in the U.S. coastwise trade in the interest of national defense. In addition, our advantage as a U.S. Citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act. In addition, maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (\u201cGATS\u201d) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in NAFTA, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime cabotage services were included in the GATS, NAFTA, USMCA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed, altered or waived, the transportation of cargo and passengers between U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag, foreign-built vessels or foreign-owned vessels. To the extent such foreign competition is permitted from vessels built in lower-cost shipyards with promotional foreign tax incentives or favorable tax regimes and crewed by non-U.S. Citizens with lower wages and benefits than U.S. citizens, such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur common stock is subject to restrictions on ownership by non-U.S. Citizens, which could require divestiture by non-U.S. Citizen stockholders and could have a negative impact on the transferability of our common stock, its liquidity and market value, and upon a change of control of the Company.\nCertain of our operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and are governed by U.S. federal laws commonly known as the Jones Act. The Jones Act restricts the transportation of merchandise and passengers for hire by water or by land and water, either directly or via a foreign port, between points in the United States and certain of its island territories and possessions, to U.S.-flag vessels that meet certain requirements, including that they are built in the United States, owned and operated by U.S. Citizens (within the meaning of the Jones Act), and manned by predominantly U.S. Citizen crews. We could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade and may become subject to penalties and risk seizure and forfeiture of our U.S.-flag vessels if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of any class or series of our capital stock. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur charter authorizes, with respect to any class or series of our capital stock, certain rules, policies and procedures, including procedures with respect to transfer of shares, to assist in monitoring and maintaining compliance with the Jones Act\u2019s U.S. citizenship requirements, which may have an adverse effect on holders of shares of our common stock.\nIn order to provide a reasonable margin for compliance with the Jones Act, the charter contains provisions that limit the aggregate percentage beneficial ownership by non-U.S. Citizens of any class or series of our capital stock (including the common stock) to 24% of the outstanding shares of each such class or series to ensure that ownership by non-U.S. Citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by the Jones Act (presently 25%).\nThe aggregate percentage of non-U.S. Citizen ownership of our outstanding common stock is expected to fluctuate based on daily trading, and may increase above the 24% maximum permitted percentage. At and during such times that the 24% permitted percentage of shares of common stock held by non-U.S. Citizens is reached, we will be unable to issue any\nfurther shares of common stock to non-U.S. Citizens (including any shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants) or permit transfers of common stock to non-U.S. Citizens. Any issuance or transfer of shares in excess of such permitted percentage shall be ineffective against us, and neither we nor our transfer agent are required to register such purported issuance or transfer of shares or be required to recognize the purported transferee or owner as our stockholder for any purpose whatsoever except to exercise our remedies. Any such excess shares in the hands of a non-U.S. Citizen shall not have any voting or dividend rights. In addition, we, in our discretion, are entitled to redeem all or any portion of such shares most recently acquired (as determined by our Board of Directors in accordance with guidelines that are set forth in the charter), by non-U.S. Citizens, in excess of such maximum permitted percentage for such class or series at a redemption price based on a fair market value formula that is set forth in the charter, which is to be paid by the issuance of redemption warrants (the \u201cRedemption Warrants\u201d) permitting the holders to receive shares of common stock in the future when the receipt thereof would not violate the charter at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. In the event that we determine that Redemption Warrants would be treated by the USCG as capital stock, or if we are unable to issue the Redemption Warrants for any other reason, we may redeem the excess shares with cash, promissory notes or a combination of both at the discretion of our board of directors.\nAs a result of these provisions, a purported stockholder who is a non-U.S. Citizen may not receive any return on its investment in any such excess shares it purportedly purchases or owns, as the case may be, and it may sustain a loss. Further, we may have to incur additional indebtedness, or use available cash (if any), to fund all or a portion of such redemption, in which case our financial condition may be materially weakened. The existence and enforcement of these requirements could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of our equity securities in the event that U.S. Citizens were unable to transfer shares in the Company to non-U.S. Citizens. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, this ownership restriction could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company. So that we may monitor and maintain our compliance with the Jones Act, provisions in the charter permit us to require that owners of any shares of our capital stock provide confirmation of their citizenship. In the event that a person does not submit such documentation to us, those provisions provide us with certain remedies, including the suspension of voting, dividend and distribution rights and treatment of such person as a non-U.S. Citizen unless and until we receive the requested documentation confirming that such person is a U.S. Citizen. As a result of non-compliance with these provisions, an owner of the shares of our common stock may lose significant rights associated with those shares.\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to effect such a redemption when such ownership of shares by non-U.S. Citizens is in excess of 25% of the common stock, or otherwise prevent non-U.S. Citizens in the aggregate from owning shares in excess of 25% of any class or series of our capital stock, or we fail to exercise our redemption rights because we are unaware that such ownership exceeds such percentage, we will likely be unable to comply with the Jones Act and will likely be required by the applicable governmental authorities to suspend our operations in the U.S. coastwise trade. Any such actions by governmental authorities would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 12758, "SIC": 4955, "TIC": "ECOL"}
