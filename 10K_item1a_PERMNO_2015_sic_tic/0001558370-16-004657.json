{"cik": "844161", "company": "CHEROKEE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe occurrence of any of the risks and uncertainties and other factors described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report and the other documents we file with the SEC could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price and could also cause our future business, financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from our historical results and the results contemplated by any forward-looking statements we may make herein, in any other document we file with the SEC, or in any press release or other written or oral statement we may make. You should carefully consider all of these risks and the other information in this Annual Report and the other documents we file with the SEC before making any investment decision with respect to our common stock. The risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report are not the only ones we face. Additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our financial condition and business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is subject to intense competition.\nRoyalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of our licensees\u2019 net sales of licensed products. Additionally, franchisees of our Flip Flop Shops brand pay us a percentage of their net sales. Merchandise bearing our Cherokee, Carole Little, Sideout, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk and Everyday California brands, all of which are manufactured and sold by both domestic and international wholesalers\nand retail licensees, as well as merchandise sold by Flip Flop Shops retail shops, are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies. Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, and private label brands (developed by retailers) such as Faded Glory, Arizona, Merona, and Route 66. Factors that shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price, fashion and other trends, avenue of purchase (including in stores and online), and the manufacturer\u2019s ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis. In recognition of what we believe is an increasing trend toward consolidation of retailers, our business plan in the United States focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers and, to a lesser extent, entering into franchise relationships with Flip Flop Shops retail store owners and engaging wholesalers to manufacture products bearing our brands and sell these products to retailers. Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of and desire for our brands, our licensees\u2019 ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and our franchisees\u2019 ability to sell products bearing our or third-party brands, and the ability of our licensees and franchisees to respond to ever-changing consumer demands. Failures with respect to any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We cannot control the level of consumer acceptance of our brands and changing preferences and trends may lead customers to purchase other products. Further, we cannot control the level of resources that our licensees or franchisees commit to supporting our brands, and our licensees may choose to support products bearing other brands to the detriment of our brands because our agreements generally do not prevent our licensees from licensing from selling products of, our competitors. In addition, we compete with other companies owning established trademarks, which have entered into, and could continue to enter into, similar arrangements with retailers and wholesale manufacturers in the U.S. and internationally, including with our existing retail and wholesale partners, thereby competing with us for consumer attention, limited floor and rack space in the same stores in which our branded products are sold and time and resources of wholesale licensees that manufacture our products.\nWe are subject to risks related to the retail business that are applicable to our licensees and franchisees.\nThere are numerous risks and other factors applicable to the businesses of retailers (including our licensees and franchisees) that can impact the sale of products that bear our brands and, with respect to our franchisees, the sale of products bearing other brands from which we generate revenues. Any decline in sales by one or more of our licensees or franchisees could adversely affect our revenues.\nFactors that may adversely affect our licensees and franchisees and their sales of products include the following, among others: (i) weather, environmental or other conditions that may impact consumer shopping activity in retail stores; (ii) consumer preferences regarding fashion trends and styles, which can be region-dependent and subject to rapid and significant fluctuations; (iii) consumer preferences regarding where to shop; (iv) the growth of online shopping and the ability of our licensees and franchisees to market and sell products through these avenues; (v) changes in the availability or cost of capital in light of the financial condition and capital requirements of our licensees and franchisees; (vi) shifts in the seasonality of shopping patterns; (vii) fluctuating retail prices; (viii) labor strikes or other interruptions that impact supply chains and transport vendors (ix) the impact of excess retail capacity; (x) changes in the cost of accepting various payment methods and changes in the rate of utilization of these payment methods; (xi) material acquisitions or dispositions; (xii) investments in new business strategies; (xiii) the success or failure of significant new business ventures or technologies; (xiv) actions taken or omitted to be taken by legislative, regulatory, judicial and other governmental authorities and officials; (xv) security breaches; (xvi) natural disasters, the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events; and (xvii) the other risks discussed in this Item 1A.\nWe rely on the accuracy of our licensees\u2019 and franchisees\u2019 retail sales reports for reporting and collecting our revenues, and if these reports are untimely or incorrect, our revenues could be delayed or inaccurately reported or collected.\nMost of our revenues are generated from retailers who license our brands to manufacture and sell products bearing our brands in their stores and on their websites. In addition, we have a number of franchise agreements with franchisees of the Flip Flop Shops brand and we have arrangements with several wholesalers who license our brands to manufacture products bearing our brands and sell these products to retailers. Under our existing agreements, these licensees and franchisees pay us fees based in part on the value of products sold. We rely on our licensees and\nfranchisees to accurately report the retail sales in collecting our license and franchise fees, preparing our financial reports, projections and budgets, and directing our sales and marketing efforts. All of our license and franchise agreements permit us to audit our licensees and franchisees. If any of our licensee or franchisee reports understate the retail sales of products they sell, we may not collect and recognize revenues to which we are entitled on a timely basis or at all, or may endure significant expense to obtain compliance.\nOur business is dependent on the success of our Direct to Retail licensing model, as well as our other licensing and franchising models.\nAlthough we recently commenced franchise operations with our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand and we intend to grow this business in the future and we also recently entered into several new licensing arrangements with wholesalers and may seek to enter into additional wholesale arrangements in the future, we continue to be focused on our Direct to Retail licensees. In Direct to Retail licensing, we grant retailers a license to use our trademarks on certain categories of merchandise. In many cases, the licensee is responsible for designing and manufacturing the merchandise, although we typically collaborate with our licensees\u2019 product development staff and merchandisers on design direction, packaging, marketing, and other aspects pertaining to products bearing our trademarks. Over the past two decades, the Direct to Retail licensing model has become more widely accepted by many retailers worldwide, and our business plan is still based on the continued success of this model with our current licensees and with new retailers we may solicit to license our brands in new territories and additional product categories as we seek to expand our business. Although we believe there is an increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers, which could support the growth of our Direct to Retail licensing model, this belief may turn out to be wrong. If our current or potential future retail licensees do not perceive our Direct to Retail licensing model to be advantageous to them, then they may move away from this model and instead embrace alternatives, such as purchasing from wholesalers or manufacturing private label products. Such a change in perception could occur for a variety of reasons, including reasons based on retailers\u2019 beliefs or expectations that do not turn out to be accurate.\nFurther, even though our pursuits of wholesale and franchise models may diversify our sources of revenue in the event that our expectations regarding Direct to Retail licensing trends do not prove to be accurate, these pursuits could themselves be unsuccessful and could divert management\u2019s attention and other resources, including time and capital, from our Direct to Retail licensing strategy. As a result, our future success depends in part on our ability to successfully manage these multiple licensing avenues.\nIf our Direct to Retail licensing model ceases to be attractive to retailers or we are unable to manage our wholesale and franchise arrangements together with our Direct to Retail licensing model, then we would be unable to continue to pursue our business plan and our financial condition and prospects would be harmed.\nOur business is largely dependent on royalties from Target, which has notified us that it will not renew its current relationship with us for the Cherokee brand.\nRoyalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target accounted for greater than 40% of our consolidated revenues during each of Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014. In September 2015, Target informed us that it would not renew its license agreement covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S., which expires at the end of its current term on January 31, 2017 for most Cherokee branded products. The license agreement with Target, including the existing royalty obligations, will remain in effect and continue to generate revenues to us in Fiscal 2017 until its expiration. Our license agreement with Target covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category will expire at the end of its current term on January 31, 2018, and will continue to generate revenues to us until its expiration. If Target were to reduce its sales of Cherokee branded products prior to expiration of its license, even if Target continues to pay the minimum annual royalties required under the license agreement with Target, any increased revenues we may receive from other licensees or franchisees may not be sufficient to offset such a reduction in royalty revenues from Target. Replacing the royalty payments received from Target is be a significant challenge, and we might not be successful in doing so. If we are not successful in replacing the Target royalty payments with equal or greater payments from other partners, the termination of this license agreement, which currently extends through January 31, 2017 could have an adverse effect upon our revenues and cash flow. In addition, in September 2012 we expanded our relationship with Target when we assumed an additional license agreement with Target for the Liz Lange brand, which we do not expect to be affected by the non-renewal of our agreements with Target covering Cherokee branded products.\nWe acquired the Liz Lange brand in part based upon our expectation that revenues from Target for this brand would grow in future periods, although such revenue growth may never occur. As a result of our reliance on Target at least through Fiscal 2017, our continued success is dependent on various factors affecting Target\u2019s business, including, for example, perceptions of Target by consumers in the United States. For example, we believe that sales of Cherokee branded products at Target in the United States after the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014 were adversely impacted following Target\u2019s announcement of unauthorized access to payment card data in U.S. stores.\nRevenues from our Hawk and Tony Hawk brands depend on Kohl\u2019s.\nIn January 2014, we acquired the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands. Concurrently with this acquisition, we entered into a retail license agreement with Kohl\u2019s, pursuant to which Kohl\u2019s is granted the exclusive right to sell Tony Hawk and Hawk-branded apparel and related products in the United States. We agreed to this exclusive license in part based upon our expectation that revenues from Kohl\u2019s for these brands will grow in future periods, although this expectation may turn out to be wrong and such revenue growth may never occur beyond the $4.8 million minimum annual royalty payment required under the license agreement.\nThe failure of our licensees to sell products bearing our brands or our franchisees to sell products that generate royalties to us, to pay us royalties for such products or to renew their license or franchise agreements with us could result in a decline in our results of operations.\nOur revenues are dependent on royalty payments made to us under our license and franchise agreements. Although the license agreements for our brands in many cases provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us, the failure of our licensees or franchisees to satisfy their obligations under their agreements with us, their decision to not renew their agreements with us or their inability to grow or maintain their businesses could cause our revenues to suffer. Further, while we are substantially dependent on our relationships with Target and Kohl\u2019s and expect to continue to be at least through Fiscal 2017 when our agreement with Target for the Cherokee brand will expire, the concurrent failure by several of our other material licensees or franchisees to meet their financial obligations to us or to renew their respective license or franchise agreements could materially and adversely impact our results of operation and our financial condition.\nOur franchise business exposes us to numerous risks.\nIn connection with our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand in October 2015, we acquired, and became the franchisor under, a number of franchise agreements with franchisees of this brand. Many of these franchisees maintain one or more Flip Flop Shops retail stores located across the globe, including in the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean, the Middle East and South Africa. This new Flip Flop Shops franchise business exposes us to a variety of risks, including, among others, that: (i) we may not be able to find capable and experienced franchisees who can implement the Flip Flop Shops brand concept and strategies we believe are necessary for the future growth of this brand or sell merchandise and operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, which could limit our revenues from this brand and diminish the image and reputation of this brand and our other brands; (ii) even if we are able to attract capable franchise owners, these franchisees may not be able to open new Flip Flop Shops retail stores in a timely manner, or manage and maintain them once opened, if they cannot secure desirable site locations, obtain adequate financing, construct and develop new store locations without delays and attract qualified operating personnel, which could slow the growth of this brand and reduce our franchise revenues; (iii) the third party brands that are sold at Flip Flop Shops stores could decline in popularity or decide to stop selling their merchandise at some or all of the Flip Flop Shops store locations, which could cause sales at these stores to decline; (iv) neighborhood or economic conditions or other demographic patterns where existing or new Flip Flop Shops stores are located could decline or otherwise change in a negative way, which could result in reduced sales by these store locations; and (v) our franchise business is subject to complex and varying franchise laws and regulations imposed by the U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, and we may need to devote significant costs and resources in order to learn and comply with these laws and regulations.\nOur wholesale licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks.\nIn our wholesale licensing relationships, we license our brands to manufacturers that produce and import various categories of apparel, footwear, home products and accessories under our trademarks and sell the licensed products to retailers. We have some historical wholesale licensees with respect to some of our brands and we have recently entered into several new wholesale arrangements. In these arrangements, we have a limited ability to control the manufacturing process, access to raw materials, the timing for delivery of finished products, the quality of finished products or costs related to the manufacturing process. Any wholesale licensees we engage may not be able to produce finished products in quantities that are sufficient to meet retailer demand, in a timely manner or at all, which could result in an inability to generate revenue from any such products and loss of retailer confidence in our brands. On the other hand, wholesale licensees may produce inventory in excess of retailer and consumer demand, in which case over-supply may cause retail prices of products bearing our products to decline. Additionally, there may be delays in the manufacturing process over which we may have no control, including shortages of raw materials, labor disputes, backlogs or insufficient devotion of resources to the manufacture of products bearing our brands. Further, we compete with other brand owners for the time and resources of our wholesale licensees, which could curtail or limit our ability to engage new or maintain existing wholesale licensee partners on acceptable terms or at all. Interruptions in the supply of products bearing our brands to retailers or lapses in quality could adversely impact our financial condition. Further, the unplanned loss of any of our wholesale licensees could lead to inadequate market coverage for retail sales of products bearing our brands, create negative impressions of us and our brands with retailers and consumers and add downward pressure on prices of products bearing our brands as a result of liquidating a former wholesaler\u2019s inventory of such products.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions.\nOur performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and the corresponding impact on levels of consumer spending, which may affect our licensees\u2019 and franchisees\u2019 retail sales. It is difficult to predict future levels of consumer spending and any such predictions are inherently uncertain. Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industries, including, among others, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Further, the worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles. Purchases of apparel, footwear and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income typically declines. As a result, during periods of economic uncertainty, slowdown or recession, the risks associated with our business are generally more acute . In addition to decreased consumer spending generally, these periods may be accompanied by decreased demand for, or additional downward pricing pressure on, the products carrying our brands. Accordingly, any prolonged economic slowdown, a lengthy or severe recession or any other negative trend in either the U.S. or the global economy is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.\nWe are subject to additional risks associated with our international licensees and franchisees.\nWe franchise our Flip Flop Shops brand and market and license our other brands outside the United States. Many of our licensees and franchisees are located outside the United States. As a key component of our business strategy, we intend to expand our international sales as well as the support we provide our international licensees and franchisees. During Fiscal 2016, approximately 30% of our revenues were derived from our international licensees. We face numerous risks in doing business outside the United States, including: (i) unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements; (ii) tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargos, and other trade barriers; (iii) difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to manage foreign licensees and franchisees; (iv) competition from foreign companies; (v) longer accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; (vi) less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of our intellectual property; (vii) changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region, particularly in emerging markets; (viii) potentially adverse tax consequences; and (ix) cultural differences in the conduct of business. Any one or more of such factors could cause our future international sales to decline or could cause us to fail to execute on our business strategy involving international expansion. In addition, our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, any violation of which could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties.\nAdditionally, and because the majority of our international revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of our international licensees\u2019 or franchisees\u2019 operations may negatively impact our royalty revenues. The main foreign currencies we encounter in our operations are the Mexican Peso, the EURO, the Great British Pound, the South African Rand, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan, and the Canadian Dollar. We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain the strength of our brands.\nOur success to date has been due in large part to the strength of our brands. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the strength of our brands may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider one or more of our brands to be outdated or associate one or more of our brands with styles that are no longer popular. In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses. Our business may be similarly affected in the future.\nWe are dependent on our intellectual property, and we may not be able to successfully protect our rights or we may become involved in costly legal proceedings regarding our intellectual property.\nWe hold various trademarks for our brands, including Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk, Everyday California, Flip Flop Shops, Sideout and Carole Little and others in connection with apparel, footwear, home and accessories. These trademarks are vital to the success and future growth of our business. These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and corresponding government agencies in numerous other countries and we also hold trademark applications for these brands in a number of other countries, although the laws of many countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. These actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights might not prevent imitation of our products, infringement of our intellectual property rights by unauthorized parties or other challenges to our intellectual property ownership, or prevent the loss of licensing or franchise revenue or other damages caused thereby. If any of these events occurs, our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially harmed. In the future, we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties, and one or more parties may assert infringement claims against us. Any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management personnel whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor. Further, if any adverse ruling in any such matter occurs, any resulting limitations in our ability to market or license our brands could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become involved in other litigation and administrative proceedings that may materially affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including commercial, employment, class action and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations, audits and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of any of these actions or legal costs associated with these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are dependent on our key management personnel.\nOur success is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key executives and employees, including, Henry Stupp, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board or Directors, Howard Siegel, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Jason Boling, our Chief Financial Officer, and Brian Curin, the President of our subsidiary FFS Holdings, LLC, which manages our Flip Flop Shops franchise operations. We have a limited number of employees and Mr. Stupp\u2019s and our other executives\u2019 leadership and experience in the apparel licensing industry and Mr. Curin\u2019s expertise in the franchising industry is important to the successful implementation of our business and marketing strategy. We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of Mr. Stupp or our other key executives or employees could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe may encounter difficulties in connection with acquisitions or other strategic transactions and we may not realize the expected benefits from these transactions.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire or represent new brands. During the past three fiscal years, we have consummated three such acquisitions: our acquisition of the Hawk and Tony Hawk signature apparel brands in January 2014; our acquisition of the Everyday California Lifestyle brand in May 2015; and our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand in October 2015. We expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other brands or to engage in other strategic transactions that could enhance our portfolio of products and services or expand the breadth of our markets. Our experience integrating acquired assets and businesses is limited, and we may not be successful in realizing the expected benefits from an acquisition. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage an expanded portfolio of brands, which could involve significantly increased costs and pose substantial challenges for management. Acquisitions and other strategic transactions can involve numerous risks and potential difficulties, including, among others: (i) problems assimilating the brands; (ii) significant future charges relating the amortization of intangible assets; (iii) problems maintaining and enforcing standards, procedures, controls, policies and information systems; (iv) difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel, and failure to retain key employees of any acquired businesses; (v) unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition, including accounting and legal charges, capital expenditures, and transaction expenses; (vi) diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business or our existing brand portfolio; (vii) adverse effects on existing business relationships with our partners; and (viii) risks associated with entering new markets or new types of business arrangements in which we have no or limited prior experience, such as, for instance, our acquisition of franchise agreements and entry into the franchising business upon our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand in October 2015. Accordingly, our recent acquisitions as well as any future transactions that we pursue could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available when needed, on favorable terms or at all. If we finance future acquisitions or other strategic transactions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders would be diluted. If we finance future acquisitions or other strategic transactions by issuing debt, we may become over-leveraged and our ability to operate our business may be restricted by the agreements governing the debt. In addition, we may experience or incur contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill or trademarks in connection with such transactions. Any of these effects could harm our operating results or financial condition.\nWe have incurred a significant amount of indebtedness to pay the cash consideration for our recent acquisitions. Our level of indebtedness, and restrictions under such indebtedness, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.\nWe entered into a credit facility with JPMorgan in September 2012 and we increased the size of the credit facility in January 2013, January 2014 and October 2015, in each case in connection with our acquisition of new brands or new rights relating to existing brands. Approximately $24 million in principal amount was outstanding under our credit facility as of January 30, 2016, and is evidenced by (i) three term notes, which were issued on January 31, 2013, January 10, 2014 and October 13, 2015 in the principal amounts of $16.6 million, $19 million and $6 million, respectively, and (ii) a revolving line of credit, pursuant to which we may borrow up to $2 million in principal. All of our outstanding indebtedness owed under the credit facility is due in March 2017.\nOur indebtedness under the credit facility could adversely affect our operations and liquidity, by, among other things: making it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because we may not have sufficient cash flows to make our scheduled debt payments; causing us to use a larger portion of our cash flow to fund interest and principal payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, product development and capital expenditures and other business activities; making it more difficult for us to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities or other strategic transactions, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and limiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, product development, capital expenditures, brand acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. We may seek to refinance all or a portion of this indebtedness before its maturity date. Any\nsuch refinancing would depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time, which could affect our ability to obtain attractive refinance terms when desired, or at all.\nIn addition, the terms of our indebtedness contain various restrictions and covenants regarding the operation of our business, including covenants that require us to obtain JPMorgan\u2019s consent before we can: (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) consummate acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, (iii) issue any equity securities other than pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans or programs, or (iv) repurchase or redeem any outstanding shares of common stock or pay dividends or other distributions, other than stock dividends, to our stockholders. The credit facility also imposes financial covenants, including a minimum \u201cfixed charge coverage ratio\u201d of at least 1.2 to 1.0 and a limitation of our \u201csenior funded debt ratio\u201d to not exceed a ratio equal to 2.00 to 1.00. Further, as collateral for the credit facility, we granted a security interest in favor of JPMorgan in all of our assets (including trademarks), and our indebtedness is guaranteed by Cherokee\u2019s wholly owned subsidiaries.\nTarget\u2019s election in September 2015 to not renew the license agreement for the Cherokee brand in the U.S. triggered an event of default under the credit facility. However, we and JPMorgan entered into a forbearance agreement immediately after Target\u2019s non-renewal election and JPMorgan subsequently waived this event of default. If an event of default occurs under the credit facility that is not forborne, cured or waived in accordance with the terms of the credit facility, JPMorgan has the right to terminate its obligations under the credit facility, accelerate the payment on any unpaid balance of the credit facility and exercise any other rights it may have, including foreclosing on our assets under the related security agreements. Our failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur future capital needs may be uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur capital requirements in future periods may be uncertain and could depend upon many factors, including: acceptance of, and demand for, our brands; the costs of developing new brands; the extent to which we invest in new brands; the number and timing of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions; the costs associated with our expansion, if any; and the costs of litigation and enforcement activities to defend our trademarks. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds, and such funds may not be available when needed, on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders would experience dilution and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders, and if we incur additional debt to raise funds, we may become over-leveraged and our ability to operate our business may be restricted by the agreements governing the debt. Moreover, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital transactions, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. If we cannot raise funds when needed, on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements. This may materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur strategic and marketing initiatives may not be successful.\nIn recent periods, we have invested significant funds and management time in furtherance of our global strategic and marketing initiatives, which are designed to strengthen our brands, assist our licensees in generating increased sales of products bearing our brands and build value for our stockholders over the long term. We expect to continue and, in some cases, expand such initiatives in future periods. While we are hopeful that our efforts in executing on these initiatives will expand our business and build stockholder value over the long-term, we may not be successful in doing so and such initiatives may not result in the intended benefits. Any failure by us to execute on our strategic initiatives, or the failure of such initiatives to cause our revenues to grow, could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results and financial performance.\nWe must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems.\nWe rely on various information technology systems, including our Enterprise Resource Planning system, to manage our operations, which subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our information technology, potential disruption of our internal control systems, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and delays or difficulties in upgrading existing systems, transitioning to new systems or integrating new systems into our current systems.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of cybersecurity and other system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our licensees and franchisees are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Although we have not experienced any such cybersecurity or system failure, accident or breach to date, some of our licensees, including Target, have experienced such events in the past. If such an event were to occur to our internal systems, it could result in a material disruption of our operations, substantial costs to rectify or correct the failure, if possible, loss of or damage to our data or applications, inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information or the incurrence of other material liabilities. If such events were to occur to our licensees\u2019 or franchisees\u2019 systems, our royalty revenues could be reduced or disrupted due to decreased sales of our branded products as a result of reputational damage, diversion of costs and other resources from selling products bearing our brands or inability of our licensees or franchisees to calculate royalties or generate royalty reports. Any of these events could severely harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our net income.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, California and certain other state jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rates could in the future be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations of tax laws, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We may be audited by tax authorities, which could evaluate and disagree with our judgments regarding our tax provisions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be expensive to defend and materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could materially affect our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. In addition, changes in tax rules may adversely affect our future reported financial results or the way in which we conduct our business.\nCompliance with changing securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards will increase our costs and pose challenges for our management team.\nExisting, changing and new laws, regulations, listing requirements and other standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure create uncertainty for public companies and significantly increase the costs and risks associated with operating as a publicly traded company in the United States. Our management team devotes significant time and financial resources to comply with existing and evolving standards for public companies. Further, the SEC has passed, promulgated or proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including, for example, with respect to the preparation and filing of financial statements, establishment or disclosure of clawback and hedging policies and disclosure of executive compensation information. The existence of new and proposed laws and regulations relating to our financial reporting or other disclosure obligations or that impose additional or more stringent compliance requirements could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors (\u201cBoard of Directors\u201d), particularly to serve on our audit and compensation committees, and qualified executive officers. In addition, in order to comply with existing and any new or additional requirements, we may need to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies, which could significantly increase our costs and divert the time and attention of our management team away from revenue generating activities. Notwithstanding our efforts, it is possible in future periods that our financial and other public reporting may not be considered timely, accurate or complete. If reporting delays or errors actually occur, we could be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, which could involve fines or other penalties, adversely affect\nour financial results, result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial information and other public disclosures, and materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our stock may be volatile and shares of our common stock are relatively illiquid.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be subject to fluctuations as a result of various factors impacting our business, including (i) our financial results, (ii) announcements by us, our retail partners or our competitors, as applicable, regarding or affecting the retail environment either domestically or internationally, the reputation of our brands, our existing or new license agreements and brand representations or acquisitions, strategic alliances or other transactions, (iii) recruitment or departure of key personnel, (iv) changes in the estimates of our financial results or changes in the recommendations of any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock, and (v) market conditions in the retail industry and the economy as a whole.\nFurther, as a result of our relatively small public float, our common stock may be less liquid than the common stock of companies with broader public ownership. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common shares may have a greater impact on the trading price for our common stock than would be the case if our public float was larger.\nWe may not pay dividends regularly or at all in the future.\nThe determination regarding the payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and therefore we may not pay any dividends in future periods, whether or not we generate sufficient cash to do so. In addition, pursuant to our credit facility with JPMorgan, we are prohibited from paying dividends without JPMorgan\u2019s consent and in the event that we would be in violation of our covenant regarding our \u201cfixed charge coverage ratio\u201d after giving effect to any proposed dividend or are otherwise then in default under such agreement.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe sale by our stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, such as under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, upon expiration of any lock-up periods applicable to outstanding shares or upon our issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or the vesting of restricted stock units, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. The availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, without action by our stockholders. Subject to the approval of JPMorgan pursuant to our credit facility, such shares of preferred stock may be issued on terms determined by our Board of Directors in its discretion, and may have rights, privileges and preferences superior to those of our common stock. For instance, such shares of preferred stock could have liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to our common stock, could have superior voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or could have other terms that negatively impact the voting control or other rights of our common stockholders. Additionally, the ownership interest of holders of our common stock would be diluted following the issuance of any shares of our preferred stock. Further, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company.\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if repeated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. It is possible that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future. In this case, our consolidated financial statements may be more likely to contain material misstatements, in which case we could be required to restate our financial results. Any such restatement of our financial results could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees and litigation and could cause our stock price to decline.\nIn addition, our current controls and procedures may not be adequate in future periods to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls in accordance with applicable standards, we may be unable to conclude in future periods that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in ensuring the reliability of our financial reports. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, our business and financial condition could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Moreover, our reputation with lenders, retailers, investors, securities analysts and others may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 79315, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "APEX"}
