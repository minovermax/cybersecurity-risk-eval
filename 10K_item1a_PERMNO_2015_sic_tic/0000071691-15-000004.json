RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors described below, as well as the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any or all of these risks, or by other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial, that may adversely affect us in the future.\nWe face significant competition in all aspects of our business.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Our print and digital products compete for advertising and circulation revenue with both traditional and new content providers. This competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital media technologies and new media providers offering online news and other content. Competition among companies offering online content is intense, and new competitors can quickly emerge. Some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new technologies and changes in market conditions.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends on many factors both within and beyond our control, including among others:\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to deliver high-quality journalism and content that is interesting and relevant to our audience;\n\u2022\nour ability to monetize new and existing print and digital products;\n\u2022\nthe popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our digital products compared with our competitors\u2019 products;\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 5\n\u2022\nthe engagement of our readers with our print and digital products;\n\u2022\nthe maintenance and development of relevant print products in an environment that is increasingly digitally focused;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented journalists and other employees and executives;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage and grow our operations in a cost-effective manner; and\n\u2022\nour reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.\nOur success depends on our ability to respond and adapt to changes in technology and consumer behavior.\nTechnology in the media industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increasing number of methods for the delivery and consumption of news and other content. These developments are driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over the ways in which they consume content. Unless we are able to use new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors and develop in a timely manner compelling new products and services that engage users across platforms, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.\nChanges in technology and consumer behavior pose a number of challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position. For example, among others:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to develop products for mobile devices or other digital platforms that consumers find engaging, that work with a variety of operating systems and networks and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\n\u2022\nthere may be changes in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our existing products;\n\u2022\nnews aggregation websites and customized news feeds may reduce our traffic levels by creating a disincentive for users to visit our websites or use our digital products;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully manage changes in search engine optimization and social media traffic to increase our digital presence and visibility may reduce our traffic levels;\n\u2022\ntechnical or other problems could prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience;\n\u2022\nnew delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions, the loss of distribution control and the loss of a direct relationship with consumers;\n\u2022\nmobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, may present challenges for traditional display advertising; and\n\u2022\ntechnology developed to block the display of advertising on websites could proliferate.\nResponding to these changes may require significant investment. We may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products, services or opportunities, and we may incur research and development costs in building, maintaining and evolving our technology infrastructure.\nOur advertising revenues are affected by numerous factors, including economic conditions, audience fragmentation and evolving digital advertising market dynamics.\nWe derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising in The Times and INYT and in our digital products. Advertising spending is sensitive to overall economic conditions, and our advertising revenues are adversely affected if advertisers respond to weak and uneven economic conditions by reducing their budgets or shifting spending patterns or priorities, or if they are forced to consolidate or cease operations.\nIn determining whether to buy advertising, our advertisers will consider the demand for our products, demographics of our reader base, advertising rates, results observed by advertisers, and alternative advertising options. The increasing number of digital media options available, through social networking tools and news aggregation websites, has expanded consumer choice significantly, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising.\nP. 6 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nPrint advertising revenue represented approximately 73% of our total 2014 advertising revenues. However, the advertising industry continues to experience a secular shift toward digital advertising, which is less expensive and can offer more directly measurable returns than traditional print media. Because rates for digital advertising are generally lower than for traditional print advertising, our digital advertising revenue may not replace in full print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift. In addition, growing consumer reliance on mobile devices exacerbates rate pressure, as rates for digital advertising are generally lower on mobile devices than on personal computers. Mobile advertising is a new and rapidly evolving market. If we are unable to grow revenues generated from mobile devices through the development of advertising products that are accepted by marketers and consumers, our advertising revenues will be adversely affected.\nDigital advertising networks and exchanges, real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are also playing a more significant role in the advertising marketplace and causing downward pricing pressure. In addition, increased inventory in the digital marketplace and evolving standards for delivery of digital advertising, such as viewability, could adversely affect advertising revenues.\nThe inability of the Company to retain and grow our subscriber base could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nCirculation revenue comprises a majority of our total revenue. In recent years, we have experienced declining print circulation volume. This is primarily due to increased competition from digital media formats and sources other than traditional newspapers (which are often free to users), higher subscription rates and a growing preference among certain consumers to receive all or a portion of their news from sources other than a newspaper. If we are unable to offset continued revenue declines resulting from falling print circulation volume with revenue from home-delivery price increases, then our print circulation revenue will be adversely affected.\nDigital subscriptions for content provided on NYTimes.com and other digital platforms generate substantial revenue for us. Our future growth depends upon our ability to retain and grow our digital subscription base and audience. To do so will require us to evolve our digital subscription model, address changing consumer requirements and develop and improve our digital products while continuing to deliver high-quality journalism and content that is interesting and relevant to our audience. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain and increase our digital audience or that we will be able to do so without taking steps such as reducing pricing or increasing costs that would affect our margin or profitability.\nIf we are unable to execute cost-control measures successfully, our total operating costs may be greater than expected, which would adversely affect our profitability.\nOver the last several years, we have taken steps to reduce operating costs by reducing staff and employee benefits and implementing general cost-control measures across the Company, and we plan to continue these cost management efforts. If we do not achieve expected savings or our operating costs increase as a result of investments in strategic initiatives, our total operating costs would be greater than anticipated. In addition, if we do not manage our costs properly, such efforts may affect the quality of our products and our ability to generate future revenues. Reductions in staff and employee compensation and benefits could also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees.\nSignificant portions of our expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with revenues. In addition, our ability to make short-term adjustments to manage our costs or to make changes to our business strategy may be limited by certain of our collective bargaining agreements. If we are not able to implement further cost-control efforts or reduce our fixed costs sufficiently in response to a decline in our revenues, this could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSecurity breaches and other network and information systems disruptions could affect our ability to conduct our business effectively.\nOur online systems store and process confidential subscriber, employee and other sensitive personal data, and therefore maintaining our network security is of critical importance. The security of these network and information systems and other technologies is important to our business activities. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of operations, including encryption and authentication technology, employee email, domain name registration, content delivery to customers, back-office support and other functions. Our systems, and those of third parties upon which our business relies, may be vulnerable to interruption or damage that can result from natural disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism or other similar events, or from deliberate attacks such as computer\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 7\nhacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing.\nDespite the security measures we and our third-party service providers have taken, our computer systems, and those of our vendors, have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to attack. We have implemented controls and taken other preventative measures designed to strengthen our systems against attacks, including measures designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at our third-party vendors. Although the costs of the controls and other measures we have taken to date have not had a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, there can be no assurance as to the cost of additional controls and measures that we may conclude are necessary in the future.\nThere can also be no assurance that the actions, measures and controls we have implemented will be effective against future attacks or be sufficient to prevent a future security breach or other disruption to our network or information systems, or those of our third-party providers. Such an event could result in a disruption of our services or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, which could harm our reputation, require us to expend resources to remedy such a security breach or defend against further attacks, divert management\u2019s attention and resources or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased operating costs or loss of revenue.\nOur international operations expose us to risks inherent in foreign operations.\nWe are focused on expanding the international scope of our operations. We face the inherent risks associated with doing business abroad, including:\n\u2022\neffectively managing and staffing foreign operations, including complying with diverse local labor laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nnavigating local customs and practices;\n\u2022\nresponding to government policies that restrict the digital flow of information;\n\u2022\nprotecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights under varying legal regimes;\n\u2022\ncomplying with international laws and regulations, including those governing the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data;\n\u2022\naddressing political or social instability;\n\u2022\nadapting to currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022\ncomplying with restrictions on repatriation of funds.\nAdverse developments in any of these areas could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have limited experience in operating and marketing our products in new international regions and could be at a disadvantage compared to competitors with more experience.\nThe underfunded status of our pension plans may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe maintain qualified defined benefit pension plans. In addition, although we sold the New England Media Group in 2013 and the Regional Media Group in 2012, we retained pension assets and liabilities and postretirement obligations related to employees of those businesses. As a result, and although we have frozen participation and benefits under all but two of the qualified pension plans we maintain, our results of operations will be affected by the amount of income or expense we record for, and the contributions we are required to make to, these plans.\nPension income and expense is calculated using a number of actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about mortality, as well as financial markets and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. The most significant year-end assumptions we use to estimate pension expense are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets. Our qualified defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by approximately $264 million as of December 28, 2014. We are required to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by laws governing those plans. A decrease in the discount rate used to determine the liabilities for pension obligations may result in increased contributions.\nP. 8 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nFailure to achieve expected returns on plan assets driven by various factors, including a continued environment of low interest rates or sustained volatility and disruption in the stock and bond markets, could also result in an increase in the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to these pension plans. In addition, unfavorable changes in underlying assumptions or applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding. As a result, we may have less cash available for working capital and other corporate uses, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur participation in multiemployer pension plans may subject us to liabilities that could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe participate in, and make periodic contributions to, various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our current and former union employees. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer pension plan will depend on the nature and timing of any triggering event and the extent of that plan\u2019s funding of vested benefits. If a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities, such underfunding will increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability. In addition, under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, special funding rules apply to multiemployer pension plans that are classified as \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201cseriously endangered,\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status. If plans in which we participate are in critical status, benefit reductions may apply and/or we could be required to make additional contributions. If, in the future, we elect to withdraw from these plans or if we trigger a partial withdrawal due to declines in contribution base units, additional liabilities would need to be recorded that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe have recorded significant withdrawal liabilities with respect to multiemployer pension plans in which we formerly participated, primarily in connection with the sales of the New England and the Regional Media Groups. Until demand letters from some of the multiemployer plans\u2019 trustees are received, the exact amount of the withdrawal liability will not be fully known and, as such, a difference from the recorded estimate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, in the event a mass withdrawal is deemed to have occurred at any of these plans, we may be required to make additional contributions under applicable law.\nA significant number of our employees are unionized, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if labor agreements were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations.\nApproximately half of our full-time equivalent work force is unionized. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wages, salaries, benefits, staffing levels and other terms with many of our employees collectively. Our results could be adversely affected if future labor negotiations or contracts were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations. If we are unable to negotiate labor contracts on reasonable terms, or if we were to experience labor unrest or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or otherwise, our ability to produce and deliver our products could be impaired. In addition, our ability to make short-term adjustments to control compensation and benefits costs, change our strategy or otherwise adapt to changing business needs may be limited by the terms and duration of our collective bargaining agreements.\nOur brand and reputation are key assets of the Company, and negative perceptions or publicity could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe New York Times brand is a key asset of the Company, and our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand. We believe that we have a very powerful and trusted brand with an excellent reputation for high-quality journalism and content. This reputation could be damaged by incidents that erode consumer trust. Our reputation could also be damaged by failures of third-party vendors we rely on in many contexts. To the extent consumers perceive the quality of our products to be less reliable or our reputation is damaged, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.\nA significant increase in the price of newsprint, or significant disruptions in our newsprint supply chain, would have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe cost of raw materials, of which newsprint is the major component, represented approximately 6% of our total operating costs in 2014. The price of newsprint has historically been volatile and may increase as a result of\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 9\nvarious factors, including a reduction in the number of suppliers due to restructurings, bankruptcies and consolidations; declining newsprint supply as a result of paper mill closures and conversions to other grades of paper; and other factors that adversely impact supplier profitability, including increases in operating expenses caused by raw material and energy costs, and currency volatility.\nIn addition, we rely on our suppliers for deliveries of newsprint. The availability of our newsprint supply may be affected by various factors, including labor unrest, transportation issues and other disruptions that may affect deliveries of newsprint.\nIf newsprint prices increase significantly or we experience significant disruptions in the availability of our newsprint supply in the future, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur debt agreements contain various covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our businesses, including our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Subject to certain exceptions, these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred equity;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or make distributions to holders of our common stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens on certain assets to secure debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments, acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates.\nOur credit ratings, as well as general macroeconomic conditions, may affect our liquidity by increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options.\nOur long-term debt is currently rated below investment grade by Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s Investors Service. If our credit ratings remain below investment grade or are lowered further, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured borrowing market, would be limited. We may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility.\nIn addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or other capital-intensive initiatives.\nOur Class B Common Stock is principally held by descendants of Adolph S. Ochs, through a family trust, and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control.\nWe have two classes of stock: Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to elect 30% of the Board of Directors and to vote, with holders of Class B Common Stock, on the reservation of shares for equity grants, certain material acquisitions and the ratification of the selection of our auditors. Holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to elect the remainder of the Board and to vote on all other matters. Our Class B Common Stock is principally held by descendants of Adolph S. Ochs, who purchased The Times in 1896. A family trust holds approximately 90% of the Class B Common Stock. As a result, the trust has the ability to elect 70% of the Board of Directors and to direct the outcome of any matter that does not require a vote of the Class A Common Stock. Under the terms of the trust agreement, the trustees are directed to retain the Class B Common Stock held in trust and to vote such stock against any merger, sale of assets or other transaction pursuant to which control of The Times passes from the trustees, unless they determine that the primary objective of the trust can be achieved better by the implementation of such transaction. Because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses, the market price of our Class A Common Stock could be adversely affected.\nOur business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, including our valuable brands, content, services and internally developed technology. We believe our proprietary trademarks and other intellectual property rights are\nP. 10 - THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY\nimportant to our continued success and our competitive position. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise unlawfully obtain and use our content, services, technology and other intellectual property, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will prevent any misappropriation or confusion among consumers and merchants, or unauthorized use of these rights.\nAdvancements in technology have made the unauthorized duplication and wide dissemination of content easier, making the enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. In addition, as our business and the risk of misappropriation of our intellectual property rights have become more global in scope, we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights in a cost-effective manner in a multitude of jurisdictions with varying laws.\nIf we are unable to procure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, including maintaining and monetizing our intellectual property rights to our content, we may not realize the full value of these assets, and our business and profitability may suffer. In addition, if we must litigate in the United States or elsewhere to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, such litigation may be costly and divert the attention of our management.\nWe have been, and may be in the future, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement that could adversely affect our business.\nWe periodically receive claims from third parties alleging infringement, misappropriation or other violations of their intellectual property rights. These third parties often include patent holding companies seeking to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained through asserting claims of infringement or misuse. Even if we believe that these claims of intellectual property infringement are without merit, defending against the claims can be time-consuming, be expensive to litigate or settle, and cause diversion of management attention.\nThese intellectual property infringement claims may require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, use more costly alternative technology or otherwise incur substantial monetary liability. Additionally, these claims may require us to significantly alter certain of our operations. The occurrence of any of these events as a result of these claims could result in substantially increased costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nAcquisitions, divestitures and other transactions could adversely affect our costs, revenues, profitability and financial position.\nIn order to position our business to take advantage of growth opportunities, we conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, investments and other transactions. We routinely evaluate our portfolio of businesses and may, as a result, buy or sell different properties. For example, in 2013, we completed the sale of the New England Media Group and our 49% equity interest in Metro Boston. We may also consider the acquisition of specific properties, businesses or technologies that fall outside our traditional lines of business and diversify our portfolio, including those that may operate in new and developing industries, if we deem such properties sufficiently attractive.\nAcquisitions or divestitures affect our costs, revenues, profitability and financial condition. Acquisitions involve significant risks, including difficulties in integrating acquired operations, diversion of management resources, debt incurred in financing these acquisitions (including the related possible reduction in our credit ratings and increase in our cost of borrowing), differing levels of management and internal control effectiveness at the acquired entities and other unanticipated problems and liabilities. Competition for certain types of acquisitions, particularly digital properties, is significant. Even if successfully negotiated, closed and integrated, certain acquisitions or investments may prove not to advance our business strategy and may fall short of expected return on investment targets, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLegislative and regulatory developments may result in increased costs and lower revenues from our digital businesses.\nOur digital businesses are subject to government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and our websites, which are available worldwide, may be subject to laws regulating the Internet even in jurisdictions where we do not do business. We may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. Revenues from our digital businesses could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, in particular by existing or future laws and regulations relating to online privacy (including the evolving right to be forgotten) and the collection and use of consumer data in digital media.\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY - P. 11\nAdverse results from litigation or governmental investigations can impact our business practices and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we are party to litigation and regulatory, environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d regarding certain matters. Adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our business as it is presently being conducted.", "PERMNO": 47466, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "NYT"}
