In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this annual report, there may also be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. As a result, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.\nFuture Changes in Interest Rates Could Reduce Our Profits.\nOur ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income earned on our interest-earning assets (such as loans and securities) and the interest expense paid on our interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings).\nShort term interest rates have been maintained at very low levels since the recession by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d). Such policies are subject to change should the FOMC believe that the economy has sufficient strength and if there were fears of building inflationary pressure. It would be difficult to predict how rapidly such changes could take place, nor to gauge the potential magnitude of rate increases.\nIncreased rates could have a significant impact on the Bank\u2019s net interest income. The section, \u201cNet Interest Income Analysis\u201d relays the negative results of a rate increase illustrated under standard financial models. We evaluate interest rate sensitivity by estimating the change in Cape Bank\u2019s net portfolio value over a range of interest rate scenarios. Net portfolio value is the difference of discounted present values of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2014, in the event of an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 3.0% decrease in net portfolio value and a $1.1 million decrease in net interest income. Interest rate decreases during the last year have been the primary cause of the effective duration of the portfolio decreasing from 4.15 years as of December 31, 2013 to 3.65 years as of December 31, 2014. See \u201cItem 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk\u201d.\nChanges in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. Historically low residential mortgage rates over the recent past may significantly increase the average life of residential mortgage loans as borrowers would be incented to keep low rate mortgages in a rising interest rate environment. Rising rates may dampen the demand for loans from both the consumer and commercial customer as the economy adjusts to higher interest costs. Rising rates would also reduce the value of securities held in the Bank\u2019s investment portfolio. Generally, the value of fixed income securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2014, the fair value of our AFS investment securities totaled $147.9 million and the amortized cost of such securities was $149.2 million. The fair value of our HTM securities totaled $17.7 million and the amortized cost of such securities was $17.9 million. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale in future periods would have an adverse effect on stockholders\u2019 equity.\nShould rates rise, management would take steps to mitigate the loss of income by lengthening the term of liabilities and borrowings, and shortening the average life of assets. We would also work to increase higher yielding assets. Such steps could fail through poor execution or inaccurate timing.\nOur Emphasis on Commercial Real Estate Loans and Commercial Business Loans May Continue to Expose Us to Increased Credit Risks.\nAt December 31, 2014, $423.2 million, or 54.3% or our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans and represented the largest percentage of our loan portfolio. Residential mortgage loans totaled $234.6 million or 30.1% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2014. In addition, at December 31, 2014, $57.7 million, or 7.4% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial business loans. Effective December 31, 2013, the Bank exited the residential mortgage loan origination business.\nCommercial real estate loans and commercial business loans generally expose a lender to a greater risk of loss than one-to-four family residential loans. Repayment of commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally depends, in large part, on sufficient income from the property or the borrower\u2019s business to cover operating expenses and debt service. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Changes in economic conditions that are beyond the control of the borrower and lender could affect the value of the security for the loan, the future cash flow of the affected property, or the marketability of a construction project with respect to loans originated for the acquisition and development of property. See \u201cBusiness-Lending Activities.\u201d\nOur Continuing Concentration of Loans in Our Primary Market Area May Increase Our Risk.\nWhile Cape has moved west from our traditional markets, our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the southern New Jersey shore communities in general. Our portfolio primarily consists of loans made to businesses in this area. While our MDOs are helping to diversify this risk, the largest geographic concentration remains in our historic markets. As a result, the local economic conditions have a significant impact on our loans and the ability of the borrowers to repay and on the value of the collateral that may secure these loans. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, or poor weather for the summer season could adversely affect our financial condition. Further, because we have a significant amount of commercial real estate loans, decreases in tenant occupancy may have a negative effect on the ability of many of our borrowers to make timely loan payments thus adversely impacting our earnings.\nThe gaming industry is a significant economic force in our market and has suffered a serious decline in revenues due to the economy and increased regional competition.\nDuring 2014, five casinos closed reducing the gaming related employment by approximately 9,000. While the remaining casinos appear to have received some benefit from the reduced competition, gaming revenues are well below levels achieved in the early 2000\u2019s. While Cape has no direct exposure to operators in this industry, casinos are a major force in the local economy and their decline will have a ripple impact throughout Atlantic County, in particular, and a larger segment of South Jersey in general. While many of the displaced workers can collect unemployment, the expiration of these benefits may prompt an increase in residential mortgage foreclosures in the future. In addition, with the housing market in Atlantic County already sluggish, the ability of casino workers to sell their homes, either for financial reasons or to relocate for employment, may be very limited.\nA Breach of Information Security Could Negatively Affect Our Earnings.\nIncreasingly, we depend upon data processing, communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks, and over the internet. We cannot be certain all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack, despite safeguards we have instituted. In addition, we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Disruptions to our vendors\u2019 systems may arise from events that are wholly or partially beyond our vendors\u2019 control (including, for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages). If information security is breached, despite the controls we have instituted, information can be lost or misappropriated, resulting in financial loss or costs to us or damages to others. Further, such breaches could cause harm to the Bank\u2019s reputation. These costs or losses could materially exceed the amount of insurance coverage, if any, which would adversely affect our earnings.\nWe Are Subject to Extensive Regulatory Oversight That Could Limit Our Operations, Products and Services, and Make Regulatory Compliance Expensive.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision. Regulators have intensified their focus on Bank lending criteria and controls, and on the USA PATRIOT Act\u2019s anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance requirements. Under Dodd-Frank, the structure of Bank regulation was changed and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFFB\u201d) was created resulting in more extensive regulation over consumer financial products is anticipated. There is also increased scrutiny of our compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). In order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in the anti-money laundering area, we have been required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems. We cannot be certain that the policies, procedures and systems we have in place meet every aspect of current regulation. Therefore, there is no assurance that in every instance we are in full compliance with these requirements. Our failure to comply with these and other regulatory requirements can lead to, among other remedies, administrative enforcement actions, and legal proceedings. In addition, recently enacted, proposed and future legislation and regulations have had, will continue to have, or may have significant impact on the financial services industry. Regulatory or legislative changes could make regulatory compliance more difficult or expensive for us, and could cause us to change or limit some of our products and services, or the way we operate our business.\nAn Inadequate Allowance for Loan Losses Would Negatively Affect Our Results of Operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans will not be sufficient to avoid losses. Credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Volatility and deterioration in the broader economy may also increase our risk of credit losses. The determination of an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses is an inherently uncertain process and is based on numerous assumptions. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that may be beyond our control, and charge-offs may exceed current estimates. We evaluate the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for loan losses that we believe is appropriate based upon such factors as, including, but not limited to: the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans; previous loan loss experience; specific loans that have loss potential; delinquency trends; the estimated fair market value of the collateral; current economic conditions; the views of our regulators; and geographic and industry loan concentrations. If any of our evaluations are incorrect and borrower defaults result in losses exceeding our allowance for loan losses, our results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected. We cannot be certain that our allowance is appropriate to cover probable loan losses inherent in our portfolio.\nThe Need to Account for Assets at Market Prices May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations.\nWe report certain assets, including investments and securities, at fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value. Because we carry these assets on our books at their fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk. Given the continued disruption in the capital markets, we may be required to recognize OTTI in future periods with respect to securities in our portfolio. The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.\nChanges in the Value of Goodwill and Intangible Assets Could Reduce Our Earnings.\nWe are required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually. Testing for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets involves the identification of reporting units and the estimation of fair values. The estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. As of December 31, 2014, if our goodwill and intangible assets were fully impaired and we were required to charge-off all of our goodwill and intangible assets, the pro-forma reduction to our net income would be approximately $2.06 per fully diluted share.\nIf the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stops Paying Dividends, This Will Negatively Affect Our Earnings.\nWe recorded dividend income of $292,000 on our Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock in 2014. However, no assurances can be given that these dividends will continue to be paid in the future. The failure of the Federal Home Loan Bank to pay dividends in the future will cause our earnings to decrease.\nFailure to Complete the Merger Could Negatively Impact the Stock Price and Future Businesses and Financial Results of the Company.\nThe Company has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Colonial Financial Services, Inc. (\u201cColonial Financial\u201d), wherein Colonial Financial will merge with and into the Company and Colonial Financial\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary bank, Colonial Bank, FSB, will merge with and into Cape Bank. If the merger is not completed, the ongoing business of the Company may be adversely affected and the Company will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe Company will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and printing fees; and\n\u25cf\nmatters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by Company management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to the Company,\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed, the Company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from customers and employees. The Company also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to enforcement proceedings to perform its obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, the Company cannot assure its stockholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially affect the business, financial results and stock prices of the Company.\nThe Company May Be Unable to Successfully Integrate Colonial Financial\u2019s Operations or Otherwise Realize the Expected Benefits From the Merger, Which Would Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nThe merger of Colonial Financial with and into the Company involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently. The difficulties of combining the operations of the two companies include:\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds;\n\u2022\ncombining different corporate cultures; and\n\u2022\nretaining key employees.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of the business and the loss of key personnel. The integration of the two companies will require the experience and expertise of certain key employees of Colonial Financial who are expected to be retained by the Company. The Company may not be successful in retaining these employees for the time period necessary to successfully integrate Colonial Financial\u2019s operations with those of the Company. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delay or difficulty encountered in connection with the merger and the integration of the two companies\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operation of the Company following the merger.\nThe success of the merger will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the business of Colonial Financial with the Company. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate Colonial Financial, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected. For example, the Company may fail to realize the anticipated increase in earnings and cost savings anticipated to be derived from the acquisition. In addition, as with regard to any merger, a significant decline in asset valuations or cash flows may also cause the Compnay not to realize expected benefits.", "PERMNO": 92555, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CBNJ"}
