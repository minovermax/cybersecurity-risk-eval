{"cik": "1688941", "company": "Foundation Building Materials, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nOur business depends on the construction industry and general business, financial market and economic conditions.\nThe construction industry is cyclical and significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions, such as employment levels, consumer confidence, demographic trends, housing demand, inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. Changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy could negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures and creditworthiness of our direct and indirect customers and suppliers, and, therefore, our margins, earnings, orders and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others. If adverse conditions affect our larger markets, such as California, Arizona, Texas and Florida, they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other companies. In addition, any uncertainty regarding global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of us or our customers, distributors and suppliers. A shortage of labor in the construction industry could also have an impact on our financial results.\nOur sales depend upon the commercial new construction market and the commercial repair and remodel market.\nWe cannot predict the duration of the current market conditions or the timing or strength of any future recovery or downturn of commercial construction activity in our markets. Weakness in the commercial construction market and the commercial repair and remodel market would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Continued uncertainty about current economic conditions will continue to pose a risk to our businesses that serve the non-residential markets. If participants in these industries postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values or other factors, this could have a material negative effect on the demand for our products and services, and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHomebuilding activity and the mortgage markets affect the demand for products we distribute, which in turn affects our business condition.\nThe distribution of our products, particularly wallboard, to contractors serving the residential market represents a significant portion of our business. Wallboard demand is highly correlated with housing starts. Housing starts and repair and remodel activity, in turn, are dependent upon a number of factors, including housing demand, housing inventory levels, housing affordability, mortgage and other interest rates, foreclosure rates, geographical shifts in the population and other changes in demographics, the availability of land, local zoning and permitting processes, the availability of construction financing and the health of the economy and mortgage markets. Unfavorable changes in any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes and adversely affect our business.\nMortgage financing and commercial credit for smaller homebuilders, as well as for the development of new residential lots, continue to be constrained. If the residential construction industry experiences weakness and a reduction in activity, our business, financial condition and operating results could be significantly and adversely affected.\nOur business relies on private investment and a slower than expected economy may adversely affect our results.\nA significant portion of our sales are for projects with non-public owners, such as non-residential builders and home builders who make investments with private funds into their projects. Construction spending is affected by our customers\u2019 ability to finance projects. Residential and nonresidential construction could decline if companies and consumers are unable to finance construction projects or if the economy slows or is stalled, which could result in delays or cancellations of capital projects. If the economy slows, or if housing starts and nonresidential projects do not increase, sales of our products and related services may decline and our financial position, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nThe majority of our net sales are credit sales that are made primarily to customers whose ability to pay is dependent, in part, upon the economic strength of the industry and geographic areas in which they operate, and the failure to collect or timely collect monies owed from customers could adversely affect our business.\nThe majority of our net sales volume is facilitated through the extension of credit to our customers whose ability to pay is dependent, in part, upon the economic strength of the industry in the areas where they operate. We offer credit to customers, either through unsecured credit that is based solely upon the creditworthiness of the customer, or secured credit for materials sold for a specific construction project where we establish a security interest in the material used in the project. The type of credit we offer depends both on the customer's financial strength and the nature of the business in which the customer is involved. End users, contractors and other non-contractor customers typically purchase more on unsecured credit than secured credit. If any of our customers are unable to repay credit that we have extended in a timely manner, or at all, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows would be adversely affected. Further, our collections efforts with respect to non-paying or slow-paying customers could negatively impact our customer relations going forward.\nBecause we depend on certain of our customers to repay extensions of credit, if the financial condition of our customers declines, our credit risk could increase as a result. In a slow economy, there is a likelihood that we will not be able to collect on certain of our accounts receivable from our customers. Significant contraction in the commercial and residential construction markets, coupled with limited credit availability and stricter financial institution underwriting standards, could adversely affect the operations and financial stability of certain of our customers. For example, we experienced payment delays and defaults from some of our customers during the recent economic downturn and subsequent slow recovery. Should one or more of our larger customers declare bankruptcy, it could adversely affect the collectability of our accounts receivable, which would in turn negatively impact our net income.\nWithin our local markets, we operate in a highly competitive industry and any failure to effectively compete could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe United States and Canadian construction industries are highly fragmented with a large number of independent specialty building products distributors in a number of our markets. Additionally, in most markets, we compete against diversified distribution companies, which may be larger and have broader product lines. Competition with competitors that have greater financial resources and are better capitalized than us could lead to lower prices, lower sales volumes, and higher costs in some markets, negatively affecting our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe also compete based on service, quality and range of products. Our competitors may be positioned to provide better service and thereby establish stronger relationships with customers and suppliers. Our competitors may also sell preferred products, develop a more comprehensive product portfolio or have more competitive prices. In addition, certain product manufacturers that sell and distribute their products directly to homebuilders may increase the volume of such direct sales.\nThere is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate. If we are unable to compete effectively with our existing competitors or new competitors who enter the markets in which we operate, our financial position, results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nThe trend toward consolidation in our industry and broader markets may negatively impact our business.\nThe trend toward consolidation in our industry and across the building markets sector as a whole could cause markets to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by distributors that are able to efficiently expand their operations. We believe these factors could result in fewer overall distributors operating multiple locations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to execute our acquisition growth strategy, and any failure to do so may make it more difficult for us to maintain or increase our economies of scales, including the level of incentives we receive from suppliers, and adversely affect our operating margins. Consolidation could also increase the competition for acquisition targets in our industry, resulting in higher acquisition costs and prices.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to execute on our greenfield branch and acquisition strategy.\nA significant portion of our historical growth has occurred through acquisitions, and our business plan provides for continued growth through acquisitions. We are presently evaluating, and we expect to continue to evaluate on an ongoing basis, a variety of possible acquisition transactions, including both smaller acquisitions and larger acquisitions that would be material to our business and results of operations. We regularly make, and we expect to continue to make, acquisition proposals, and we may enter into letters of intent for acquisitions. We cannot predict the timing of any contemplated transactions, and there can be no assurances that we will identify suitable acquisition opportunities or, if we do identify such opportunities, that any transaction can be consummated on acceptable terms. In addition, even if we consummate an acquisition, there is no assurance that it will result in enhanced value for our stockholders. Furthermore, a significant change in our business or the economy, an unexpected decrease in our cash flows or any restrictions imposed by our debt may limit our ability to obtain the necessary capital for acquisitions or otherwise impede our ability to complete an acquisition. Our recent growth and our acquisition strategy have placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management\u2019s time, which may divert their attention from our business, and may lead to significant due diligence and other expenses regardless of whether we pursue or consummate any acquisition. Failure to identify suitable transaction partners and to consummate transactions on acceptable terms, as well as the commitment of time and resources in connection with such transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also supplement our organic growth through the establishment of greenfield branches. We are generally contemplating several potential locations at any one time, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure the real estate, personnel or financing to open additional greenfield branches. In addition, even if we are able to establish new greenfield branches, there is no guarantee that we will realize the expected value from these decisions.\nOur acquisition strategy exposes us to significant risks and additional costs.\nAcquisitions also involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform as expected and that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of acquired businesses will prove incorrect. We may not accurately assess the value, strengths, weaknesses or potential profitability of an acquisition target. We may become liable for certain unforeseen pre-acquisition liabilities of an acquired business, including, among others, tax liabilities, product liabilities, asbestos liabilities, environmental liabilities, pension liabilities and liabilities for employment practices, and these liabilities could be significant. In addition, an acquisition could result in the impairment of customer or vendor relationships or certain acquired assets such as inventory and goodwill. We may also incur costs and inefficiencies to the extent an acquisition expands the industries, products, markets or geographies in which we operate due to our limited exposure to and experience in a given industry, market or region. Large or a number of smaller acquisitions may also require that we incur additional debt to finance the transaction, which could be substantial and impose operational or financial restrictions on our business and result in debt service costs. Acquisitions can also involve post-transaction disputes with the counterparty regarding a number of matters, including purchase price, inventory or other working capital adjustment, environmental liabilities or pension obligations. If any of these risks were to occur, our financial position, results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nAny inability to successfully integrate our recent or future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAcquisitions will require the integration of acquired companies\u2019 sales and marketing, distribution, purchasing, finance and administrative organizations, as well as exposure to different legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions in which we have not previously operated. We may not be able to integrate successfully any business we may acquire or have acquired into our existing business, or may not be able to do so in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner. Our inability to complete the integration of new businesses in a timely and orderly manner could increase costs and lower profits. Factors affecting the successful integration of acquired businesses include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ndiverting the attention of our management and that of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nmerging or linking different accounting and financial reporting systems and systems of internal controls;\n\u2022\nmerging computer, technology and other information networks and systems;\n\u2022\nassimilating personnel, human resources and other administrative departments and potentially contrasting corporate cultures;\n\u2022\nconsolidating locations in a timely and efficient manner;\n\u2022\nincurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndisrupting our relationship with or loss of key customers, suppliers or personnel;\n\u2022\ninterfering with, or loss of momentum in, our ongoing business or that of the acquired company; and\n\u2022\ndelays or cost-overruns in the integration process.\nAny of our acquisition or other integration-related issues could divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our day-to-day operations, cause significant disruption to our business and lead to substantial additional costs. Our inability to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or to successfully integrate acquired companies, as well as other transaction-related issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, possible future acquisitions or dispositions may trigger a review by the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, under their respective regulatory authority, focusing on the effects on competition, including the size or structure of the relevant markets and the pro-competitive benefits of the transaction. Any delay, prohibition or modification required by regulatory authorities could adversely affect the terms of a proposed acquisition or could require us to modify or abandon an otherwise attractive acquisition opportunity.\nAn impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAcquisitions frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets. At December 31, 2018, goodwill represented 36.8% of our total assets. Goodwill is not amortized and is subject to impairment testing at least annually using a fair value based approach. The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our reporting unit, which is consistent with our operating and reportable segment. The estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment and incorporates management's assumptions about expected future cash flows and other valuation techniques. The recoverability of goodwill is evaluated at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has more likely than not declined below its carrying value. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets, and, in the future, we may be required to take additional goodwill or other asset impairment charges relating to certain of our reporting units. Any such non-cash charges would have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe loss of, or a significant decline in business with, one or more of our suppliers, or the development of alternatives to distributors in the supply chain, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMost of our sales are reliant upon maintaining our agreements and other relationships with suppliers of building products including wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and metal framing. Some of these relationships with key suppliers, including Armstrong, provide us with exclusive distribution rights in certain areas while others provide us with access to leading brands in many of our key markets. The loss of distribution rights with any of our key suppliers would have a material adverse impact on our sales and profitability. In addition, many of our suppliers could grant distribution rights in semi-exclusive markets to a competing distributor at any time, which could lead to a loss of market share in these markets, a loss of the share of a customer\u2019s spend related to such products and a reduction in net sales. We cannot assure you that the current level of business with our suppliers can be maintained or that sales and profit will remain at or near current levels.\nIn addition, our customers could begin purchasing more of their product needs directly from manufacturers, which would result in decreases in our net sales and earnings. Our suppliers could invest in infrastructure to expand their own sales forces and sell more products directly to our customers or could seek out new distribution partners. These changes in the supply chain could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIf we fail to qualify for supplier rebates or are unable to maintain or adequately renegotiate our rebate arrangements, our gross margins and income could be materially adversely affected.\nMany of our products are purchased pursuant to rebate arrangements that entitle us to receive a rebate based on the volume of our purchases. Such arrangements generally require us to purchase minimum quantities in certain geographies or product categories and result in higher rebates with increased quantities of purchases. These rebates effectively reduce the costs of our products, and we manage our business to take advantage of these programs. When assessing the desirability of acquisitions, we consider the effects of such acquisitions on our ability to qualify for rebates. Rebate arrangements are subject to renegotiation with our suppliers from time to time. In addition, consolidation of suppliers may result in the reduction or elimination of rebate programs in which we participate. If we are unable to qualify for these rebates, are unable to renew rebate programs on desirable terms or are unable to obtain the expected rebate benefits of our acquisitions, or a supplier materially reduces or stops offering rebates, our costs could materially increase and our gross margins and income could be materially adversely affected.\nA material disruption at one of our suppliers\u2019 facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and negatively affect our overall financial results.\nAny of the following events could cease or limit operations unexpectedly: fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, on-site or off-site environmental incidents or other catastrophes; utility and transportation infrastructure disruptions; labor difficulties; other operational problems; or war, acts of terrorism or other unexpected events. Any downtime or facility damage at our suppliers, including one of the major wallboard suppliers, could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make more expensive purchases from a competing supplier. If our suppliers were to incur significant downtime, our ability to satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in customers seeking products from other distributors, as well as decreased customer satisfaction and lower sales and operating income. Because we purchase from a limited number of wallboard manufacturing facilities, the effects of any particular shutdown or facility damage could be significant to our operations as a whole and pronounced in the markets near the facility affected.\nWeather can materially affect our business and we are subject to seasonality.\nSeasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can adversely affect our business and operations through a decline in both the use and production of our products and demand for our services. Adverse weather conditions, such as extended rainy and cold weather in the spring and fall, can reduce demand for our products and reduce sales or render our distribution operations less efficient. Major weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, heavy snows and flooding could also adversely affect sales.\nConstruction materials production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during the second and third quarters typically result in higher activity and sales levels during those quarters. The first quarter typically has lower levels of activity due to inclement weather conditions. In particular, the activity level during the second quarter has historically varied greatly with variations in temperature and precipitation.\nMost of our facilities are held under long-term, non-cancelable leases and a substantial number of such properties are leased from the former owners of acquired businesses. The interests of such lessors may be in conflict with our interests and we may be unable to renew leases on favorable terms or at all.\nMost of our facilities are leased pursuant to lease agreements that generally are non-cancelable and have initial terms ranging from three to 20 years, with options to renew for specified periods of time. In addition, a substantial portion of such facilities are leased from former owners of businesses we have acquired, and our relationships with such lessors could be adversely affected by unrelated business decisions or conflicts arising from such acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew our current or future leases on favorable terms or at all. In addition, if we close or idle a facility, we generally remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which include, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term.\nAny significant fuel cost increases or shortages in the supply of fuel could disrupt our ability to transport and distribute our products to customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe currently use our own fleet of owned and leased vehicles to transport and distribute our products to our customers. The cost of fuel for these vehicles is largely unpredictable and has a significant effect on our business and results of operations. Prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside our control. Political events in petroleum-producing regions, as well as hurricanes, floods and other weather-related events may cause the price of fuel to increase. A rise in fuel prices could make it unprofitable for us to service certain customers or regions. Significant increases in the cost of fuel or disruptions in the supply of fuel could materially adversely affect our business, sales and results of operations.\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations and any changes to, or liabilities arising under, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things: the release or discharge of materials into the environment; the management, use, generation, treatment, processing, handling, storage, transport or disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials; and the protection of public and employee health and safety and the environment. These laws and regulations impose strict liability in some cases without regard to negligence or fault and expose us to liability for the environmental condition of our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated facilities, and may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions, even if such actions complied with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for claims of personal injury or property or natural resource damage related to alleged exposure to, or releases of, regulated or hazardous materials. The existence of contamination at properties we own, lease or operate could also result in increased operational costs or restrictions on our ability to use those properties as intended, including for purposes of construction materials distribution. In addition, because our properties are generally situated adjacent to or near industrial companies, our properties may be at an increased risk of having environmental contaminants from other properties spill or migrate onto or otherwise affect our properties.\nDespite our compliance efforts, there is an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business, especially from an environmental standpoint, and, from time to time, we may be in noncompliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These potential liabilities or non-compliances could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability. In some instances, we must have government approvals, certificates, permits or licenses in order to conduct our business, which may require us to make significant capital, operating and maintenance expenditures to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to obtain and maintain required approvals, certificates, permits or licenses or to comply with applicable governmental requirements could result in sanctions, including substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some or all of our operations. Future changes in law, resulting in stricter laws and regulations, more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations or the future discovery of environmental conditions may impose new liabilities on us, reduce operating hours, require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment or impede our ability to open new or expand existing plants or facilities. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. The cost of complying with such laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe depend on our senior management, and our business may be adversely impacted if we lose any member of our senior management or are unable to recruit additional management and other personnel.\nWe are dependent upon the services of our senior management, especially our President and Chief Executive Officer Ruben Mendoza, our Chief Financial Officer John Gorey, our Chief Operating Officer Pete Welly and our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing Kirby Thompson. The loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management team could harm our business and future development. Our continued growth also will depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional skilled management personnel. We believe there is a limited number of qualified people in our business and the industry in which we compete. As such, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and retain the key personnel that may be necessary to grow our business effectively or successfully implement our growth strategy. If we are unable to attract and retain the requisite personnel as needed in the future, our operating results and growth could suffer.\nEmployee disputes or employee-related cost increases could disrupt operations of our businesses.\nWhile we believe our relationships with our employees are generally good, a failure to maintain good relationships with our employees could have a material adverse effect on us. A work disruption or stoppage at one of our branches could cause us to lose sales, incur increased costs and adversely affect our ability to meet customers\u2019 needs. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 5.9% of our workforce were members of unions. However, if a larger number of our employees were to unionize, including in the wake of any future legislation that makes it easier for employees to unionize, our business could be negatively affected. We had approximately 3,400 employees as of December 31, 2018. Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationships with our employees and affect our operating costs. These laws relate to, among other things, employee classifications as exempt or non-exempt, minimum wage requirements, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, overtime, family leave, anti-discrimination laws, safety standards, payroll taxes, citizenship requirements and other wage and benefit requirements. As our employees may be paid at rates that relate to the applicable minimum wage, further increases in the minimum wage could increase our labor costs. In addition, we sometimes must compete for employees with necessary skills and experience or in tight labor markets which can also increase costs. Any such cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we compete with other companies for many of our employees, and we invest significant resources to train and motivate our employees to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. If we are unable to effectively retain highly qualified employees in the future, it could adversely impact our operating results.\nOur business is cyclical and requires significant working capital to fund operations.\nOur business is cyclical and requires that we maintain significant working capital to fund our operations. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business and service our outstanding debt and other obligations, we may be required, among other things, to further reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures, sell assets or take other measures, including the restructuring of all or a portion of our debt, which may only be available, if at all, on unsatisfactory terms.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage our inventory and working capital as our sales volume increases or the prices of the products we distribute fluctuate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe purchase certain products, including wallboard, suspended ceiling systems, metal framing and other specialty building materials, from manufacturers which are then sold and delivered to customers. We must maintain, and have adequate working capital to purchase, sufficient inventory to meet customer demand. Due to the lead times required by our suppliers, we order products in advance of expected sales. As a result, we are required to forecast our sales and make purchasing decisions accordingly. In periods characterized by significant changes in economic growth and activity in the commercial and residential building and home repair and remodel industries, it can be especially difficult to forecast our sales accurately. We must also manage our working capital to fund our inventory purchases. Increases in the market prices of certain building products, such as wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and metal framing, can put negative pressure on our operating cash flows by requiring us to invest more in inventory. In addition, we may not be able to pass along increases in product costs through to our customers, which would put downward pressure on our margins. In the future, if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and working capital as we attempt to expand our business, our cash flows may be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA failure to implement or integrate, or a disruption in, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIntegration of our acquisitions has required and will continue to require, significant attention from our employees and substantial resources. Among other matters, we are faced with migrating acquired companies\u2019 information related to purchasing, sales, inventory management and rebates to our systems or, in some cases maintaining multiple systems for a period of time.\nAs our operations grow in both size and scope, and as we integrate our acquisitions, we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our information systems and infrastructure. These and any other upgrades to our systems and information technology, or new technology, now and in the future, will require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in compliance with those requirements. In addition, we rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure to maintain our existing business.\nA disruption resulting from a problem with the implementation, integration or functioning of an important information technology system or a security breach of such a system could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to cybersecurity risks, information technology interruptions, and business continuity risks.\nOur cybersecurity and processing systems, as well as those of our third-party providers may experience damage or disruption from a number of causes, including power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, computer viruses, malware or other destructive software, internal design, manual or usage errors, cyberattacks, terrorism, workplace violence or wrongdoing, catastrophic events, natural disasters and severe weather conditions. We may also be impacted by breaches of our third-party processors. Although no breaches have had a direct, material impact on us, we are unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of any future attacks to our business.\nIn addition, numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyberattacks, phishing and social engineering schemes, particularly on internet applications, could compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data in our systems. The security measures and procedures we, our clients and third-party service providers have in place to protect sensitive data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches, cyberattacks, or system failures. Although we devote resources to our cybersecurity programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems change frequently, have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated, and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely. As these threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to devote significant additional resources in order to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nTrade policies could make sourcing product from foreign countries more difficult or more costly.\nWe source some of our products from outside of the United States. Suppliers that we utilize may rely upon non-domestic products, and therefore, any significant changes to the United States trade policies (and those of other countries in response) may cause a material adverse effect on our ability to procure products from suppliers that source from other countries or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur foreign operations could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe distribute products in Canada, and we are therefore subject to a number of risks specific to this country and may become subject to risks specific to countries where we complete acquisitions. These risks include social, political and economic instability, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, currency exchange fluctuations, acts of war or terrorism and import/export requirements. Our financial statements are reported in United States dollars with international transactions being translated into United States dollars. There can be no assurances that any of these factors will not materially impact our production cost or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to product liability, warranty, casualty, construction defect, contract, tort, employment and other claims and legal proceedings related to our business, the products we distribute, the services we provide and services provided for us by third parties.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims and litigation. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources. The building materials industry has been subject to personal injury and property damage claims arising from alleged exposure to raw materials contained in building products, as well as claims for incidents of catastrophic loss, such as building fires. As a distributor of building materials, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of the products we distribute are alleged to have resulted in economic loss, personal injury or property damage or violated environmental, health, safety or other laws. Product liability claims have included and may in the future include allegations of personal injury related to asbestos-containing products, defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties.\nWe are also from time to time subject to casualty, contract, tort and other claims relating to our business, the products we distribute, and the services we provide, either directly or through third parties. If any claim were adversely determined, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected if we were unable to seek indemnification for such claims or were not adequately insured for such claims. We rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the wallboard, suspended ceiling systems, metal framing and other products we sell or distribute. Since we do not have direct control over the quality of such products that are manufactured or supplied to us by third parties, we are particularly vulnerable to risks relating to the quality of such products. In addition, we are exposed to potential claims arising from the conduct of our employees, builders and their subcontractors and third-party installers for which we may be liable. We and they are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of third-party installers. If we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations.\nAlthough we believe we currently maintain suitable and adequate insurance, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities and the cost of any litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Additionally, we do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter and we also self-insure for certain other risks. Any significant uninsured or self-insured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts. There can be no assurance that any current or future claims will not adversely affect our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to special hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses which may not be covered by insurance.\nOperating hazards, such as unloading heavy products, operating large machinery and driving hazards, which are inherent in our business and in some cases outside of our control, can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment and environmental damage. We maintain insurance coverage in amounts and against the risks we believe are consistent with industry practice, but this insurance may not be adequate or available to cover all losses or liabilities we may incur in our operations. Our insurance policies are subject to varying levels of deductibles. Losses up to our deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. However, liabilities subject to insurance are difficult to estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety programs. If we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we might also be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims rather than using working capital to maintain or expand our operations.\nOur business may be subject to additional obligations to collect and remit sales tax and other taxes and we may be subject to tax liability for past sales.\nStates and some local taxing jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. It is possible that we could incur additional liabilities that exceed our estimates and we could assume tax liabilities through our acquisitions. Other state tax authorities could still assert that we are obligated to collect additional amounts as taxes from our customers and remit those taxes to those authorities. We could also be subject to audits with respect to states and foreign jurisdictions for which we have not accrued tax liabilities. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales or other taxes on our services in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for sales taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nOur leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk, give creditors secured claims to any collateral securing the debt, and restrict us from making certain strategic decisions.\nOur business is leveraged. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate principal amount of our credit facility related debt was approximately $596.0 million, which was comprised of $146.0 million under our asset-based lending facility, or 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, and $450.0 million under our term loan, or 2018 Term Loan Facility. Additionally, we may borrow additional funds under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, and increase the borrowing capacity thereunder. We may also seek to refinance our credit facilities or borrow additional amounts under new credit arrangements.\nOur degree of debt leverage could have important consequences for you, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to make payments on our existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates on our borrowings under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, which is at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making certain strategic decisions due to operational covenants;\n\u2022\ncausing us to incur expenses relating to the hedging of our variable interest rate exposure;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less leveraged.\nOur ability to make payments on debt, to repay existing indebtedness when due and to fund operations and significant planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our ability to produce cash from operations is, and will be, subject to a number of risks, including those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBorrowings under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and allow certain borrowings in Canadian dollars, which may expose us to interest rate and currency risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed will remain the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.\nAdditional financing, if required, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, our ability to borrow under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility is subject to our ability to satisfy significant conditions.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur more debt.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. For example, we expect to incur additional indebtedness in connection with future acquisitions. Although the credit agreement governing the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, or 2018 ABL Credit Agreement, contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with (or as a result of waiver of) these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility provided for an unused commitment of $229.0 million (without giving effect to any outstanding letters of credit, and subject to borrowing base limitations).\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. The ability to generate cash or refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our respective obligations under, our indebtedness, and to fund planned capital expenditures and other corporate expenses will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to satisfy our respective obligations under our indebtedness or to fund our other needs. In order for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and fund planned capital expenditures, we must continue to execute our business strategy. If we are unable to do so, we may need to reduce or delay our planned capital expenditures or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Significant delays in our planned capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic plans. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur tax receivable agreement, or TRA, requires that, after Lone Star, our majority stockholder, no longer controls us, any senior debt document that refinances or replaces our existing indebtedness permit our subsidiaries to make dividends to us, without any conditions, to the extent required for us to make payments under the TRA, unless Lone Star otherwise consents. At the time of any such refinancing, it may not be possible to include this term in such senior debt documents, and as a result, we may need Lone Star\u2019s consent to complete such refinancing.\nThe 2018 ABL Credit Agreement restricts our ability and the ability of most of our subsidiaries to engage in some business and financial transactions.\nThe 2018 ABL Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or guarantees;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on assets;\n\u2022\nchange our fiscal year;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022\nincur additional liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans or advances;\n\u2022\nrepay subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022 make certain acquisitions;\n\u2022 engage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nchange our lines of business;\n\u2022\nrestrict distributions by our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\namend or otherwise modify organizational documents or certain debt agreements; and\n\u2022\nmanage cash and other assets in our deposit accounts and securities accounts.\nIn addition, the 2018 ABL Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The 2018 ABL Credit Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon a change of control). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.\nAny future debt that we incur may contain additional negative covenants and financial maintenance covenants. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain debt financing, repurchase stock, refinance or pay principal on our outstanding debt, complete acquisitions, execute our strategic plans, or react to changes in our operating environment or the economy.\nOur failure to comply with obligations under the 2018 ABL Credit Agreement or the agreements governing any other indebtedness we may enter into in the future, may result in an event of default under the applicable agreement. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of some or all of our indebtedness. We cannot be certain that we will be able to remedy any defaults. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nBecause our common stock has only recently started trading in the public market, the trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could decline substantially.\nPrior to the public offering of our stock in February 2017, there had been no market for shares of our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol \"FBM,\" an active trading market for the shares of our common stock may not be sustained and the trading price of our common stock may be volatile.\nSome of the factors that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock or result in significant fluctuations in price, regardless of our actual operating performance, include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in the markets in which we operate or speculation that changes may occur;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nactions by our significant stockholders, including the sale by Lone Star of any of its shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community about our business or industry;\n\u2022\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions, including an economic slowdown;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates or perceptions that changes could occur;\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nour ability to accurately project future results and our ability to achieve those and other industry and analyst forecasts; and\n\u2022\nnew legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us, our markets or our industry.\nFurthermore, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry, and often occurs without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Therefore, factors that have little or nothing to do with us could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, and these fluctuations or any fluctuations related to our company could cause the market price of our common stock to decline materially.\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we may avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements, which may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under applicable SEC rules and regulations, and, as a result of the SEC\u2019s recent amendment to the definition of \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we will continue to be a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for so long as the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of the end of our most recently completed second quarter is less than $250 million. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we have relied on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies. These exemptions include reduced financial disclosure and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of control over financial reporting. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event that it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating.\nTo continue to comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing additional internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. Testing and maintaining internal control can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nThe coverage of our business or our common stock by securities or industry analysts or the absence thereof could adversely affect our stock price and trading volume.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced in part by the research and other reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us or our business or industry. We currently have, but may not be able to continue, research coverage by industry or financial analysts. If analysts do not continue coverage of us, the trading price and volume of our stock would likely be negatively impacted. We may be at greater risk that analysts will not continue coverage of us given our recent designation as a \"smaller reporting company\" for SEC reporting purposes. Even if analyst coverage continues, if one or more analysts who do cover us downgrades our stock, or if they issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or inaccurate research, our stock price would likely decline. Furthermore, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets. Any of the foregoing would likely cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nLone Star may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders and may limit our minority stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters.\nLone Star beneficially owns approximately 65.4% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of this concentration of stock ownership, Lone Star acting on its own has sufficient voting power to effectively control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including director elections and proposed amendments to our bylaws or certificate of incorporation. Currently, six of the nine members of our Board are employees or affiliates of Lone Star.\nIn addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a merger, consolidation or other business combination or change in control of our company and make some transactions that might otherwise give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock more difficult or impossible without the support of Lone Star. Because we have opted out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, regulating certain business combinations with interested stockholders, Lone Star may transfer control of us to a third party, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Lone Star could transfer control of us to a third-party by transferring its common stock, which would not require the approval of our Board or other stockholders. The interests of Lone Star may not always coincide with our interests as a company or the interests of other stockholders. Accordingly, Lone Star could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements of which our other stockholders would not approve or make decisions with which our other stockholders would disagree. This concentration of ownership may also adversely affect our share price.\nLone Star is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us, although it does not currently hold any such interests. Lone Star may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In recognition that principals, members, directors, managers, partners, stockholders, officers, employees, consultants and other representatives of Lone Star and its affiliates and investment funds may serve as our directors or officers, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that none of Lone Star or any principal, member, director, manager, partner, stockholder, officer, employee or other representative of Lone Star has any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business that we do. In the event that any of these persons or entities acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for itself and us, we will not have any expectancy in such corporate opportunity, and these persons and entities will not have any duty to communicate or offer such corporate opportunity to us and may pursue or acquire such corporate opportunity for themselves or direct such opportunity to another person. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if, among other things, attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by Lone Star to themselves or their other affiliates.\nLone Star may also have conflicts of interest with us and our stockholders as a result of its status as a party to the TRA. For example, the TRA entered into with Lone Star at the time of the IPO gives us the right to terminate the TRA with approval of a majority of our independent directors and with Lone Star\u2019s consent by making a payment equal to the present value of future payments under the TRA (based on certain assumptions and deemed events in the agreement, including those relating to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 future taxable income). Lone Star may determine to withhold its consent to terminate the TRA at a time when such a termination would be favorable to us and the other stockholders or Lone Star may elect to terminate the TRA upon certain changes of control or at any time following the fifteenth anniversary of our IPO at a time when such a termination would not be favorable to us and the other stockholders. Furthermore, the TRA prohibits us from settling any tax audit without Lone Star\u2019s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if the outcome of the audit is reasonably expected to affect Lone Star\u2019s rights under the TRA. Therefore, Lone Star may determine to withhold consent to a settlement that reduces the payments Lone Star will receive under the TRA, even though the settlement might be favorable to us and our stockholders.\nWe are required to pay Lone Star for certain tax benefits, and these amounts are expected to be material.\nWe have entered into a TRA with Lone Star that provides for the payment by us to Lone Star of 90% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in United States federal, state, local and non-U.S. income tax that we and our subsidiaries realize (or in some circumstances are deemed to realize) as a result of the utilization of certain tax benefits, together with interest accrued at a rate of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 300 basis points from the date the applicable tax return is due (without extension) until paid. These tax benefits, or collectively the Covered Tax Benefits, include: (a) all depreciation and amortization deductions, and any offset to taxable income and gain or increase to taxable loss, resulting from the tax basis that we had in our assets as of the time of our IPO, (b) the utilization of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 net operating losses and tax credits, if any, attributable to periods prior to our IPO, (c) deductions in respect of payments made, funded or reimbursed by Lone Star under the LSF9 Cypress Parent, LLC Long Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, (d) deductions in respect of transaction expenses attributable to certain acquisitions made by us prior to our IPO, (e) deductions in respect of the debt issuance costs and original issue discount associated with certain of our financing agreements, and (f) deductions in respect of expenses related to our IPO and (g) certain other tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA.\nWe expect that the payments we make under the TRA could be substantial. Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law and that we and our subsidiaries earn sufficient income to realize the full tax benefits subject to the TRA, we currently estimate that future payments under the agreement will aggregate to $134.6 million. This amount excludes any payments that may be made to Lone Star under the TRA as a result of tax benefits recognized in connection with payments under the LTIP and, thus, the actual payments we ultimately are required to make under the TRA could be greater, potentially materially greater, than these amounts. These payment obligations are our obligations and are not obligations of any of our subsidiaries. Furthermore, these payment obligations are not conditioned upon Lone Star maintaining a continued direct or indirect ownership interest in us. The actual utilization of Covered Tax Benefits, as well as the timing of any payments under the TRA, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount, character and timing of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 taxable income in the future.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made to Lone Star under the TRA in the event that the tax benefits are disallowed.\nLone Star will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the TRA if such benefits are subsequently disallowed upon a successful challenge by the Internal Revenue Service, although future payments under the agreement would be adjusted to the extent possible to reflect the result of such disallowance. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the TRA in excess of our cash tax savings if any, from the Covered Tax Benefits, and we may not be able to recoup those payments, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nIn certain cases, payments made by us under the TRA may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the Covered Tax Benefits.\nThe term of the TRA will continue until all Covered Tax Benefits have been utilized or expired, unless we exercise our right to terminate the agreement with approval of a majority of our independent directors and with Lone Star\u2019s consent, we breach any of our material obligations under the agreement, certain credit events occur with respect to us, Lone Star elects to terminate the TRA upon certain changes of control or Lone Star exercises its right after the fifteenth anniversary of our IPO to terminate the TRA, in any of which cases we will be required to make an accelerated payment to Lone Star equal to the present value of future payments under the TRA. Such payment would be based on certain assumptions, including the assumption that we have sufficient taxable income and tax liability to fully utilize all Covered Tax Benefits. The TRA also provides that upon certain changes of control, in the event that Lone Star does not elect to terminate the TRA, our (or our successor\u2019s) payments under the TRA for each taxable year after any such event would be based on certain valuation assumptions, including the assumption that we and our subsidiaries have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the Covered Tax Benefits. Accordingly, payments under the TRA may be made years in advance of the actual realization, if any, of the anticipated future tax benefits and may be significantly greater than the benefits we realize in respect of the Covered Tax Benefits.\nEven if the payments under the TRA are not accelerated as described above, such payments may be significantly greater than the benefits we realize in respect of the Covered Tax Benefits, due to the manner in which payments are calculated under the TRA. For example, for purposes of calculating the payments to be made to Lone Star:\n\u2022\nit is assumed that we will pay state and local taxes at a rate of 5%, even though our actual effective state and local tax rate may be materially lower;\n\u2022\ntax benefits existing at the time of our IPO are deemed to be utilized before any post-closing/after-acquired tax benefits and, as a result, we could be required to make payments to Lone Star for a particular tax year even if our tax liability for such year would have been materially reduced or eliminated by reason of our utilization of the post-IPO/after-acquired tax benefits;\n\u2022\na non-taxable transfer of assets by us to a non-consolidated entity is treated under the TRA as a taxable sale at fair market value and, as a result, we could be required to make payments to Lone Star even though such non-taxable transfer would not generate any actual tax benefits to us or our non-consolidated entity; and\n\u2022\na taxable sale or other taxable transfer of subsidiary's stock by us is (in cases where the subsidiary\u2019s tax basis in its assets exceeds our tax basis in the subsidiary\u2019s stock) treated under the TRA as a taxable sale of the subsidiary\u2019s assets and, as a result, we could be required to make payments to Lone Star that materially exceed the actual tax benefit we realize from such stock sale.\nBecause of the foregoing, our obligations under the TRA could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control.\nCertain provisions of the TRA limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business and growth strategy.\nFor so long as the TRA remains outstanding, without the prior written consent of Lone Star (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), we are restricted from (a) entering into any agreement or amendment, after Lone Star ceases to control us, that would materially restrict (or in the case of amendments, further restrict beyond the restrictions in our existing financing agreements) our ability to make payments under the TRA, or (b) unless permitted by the terms of the 2018 ABL Credit Agreement or any replacement senior debt document to the extent that the terms thereof are no less restrictive in this regard than the 2018 Term Loan Facility and the 2018 ABL Credit Agreement, incurring debt that would cause our consolidated total leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness for borrowed money less balance sheet cash to consolidated EBITDA) to exceed 6.00 to 1.00. In addition, we are prohibited under the TRA from replacing our existing financing agreements with any senior debt document that does not permit our subsidiaries to make dividends to us to the extent necessary to make the payments under the TRA, without conditions, unless Lone Star otherwise consents. These restrictions on the incurrence of debt could adversely affect our business, including by preventing us from pursuing an acquisition or other strategic transaction that we believe is in the best interests of our company and our stockholders, thereby impeding our growth strategy. Lone Star has no fiduciary duties to us when deciding whether to enforce these covenants under the TRA. Moreover, these restrictions on amending or refinancing our existing indebtedness could result in a requirement to obtain Lone Star\u2019s consent for any such amendment or refinancing. Furthermore, the provision in the TRA that requires that we make an accelerated payment to Lone Star equal to the present value of all future payments due under the TRA if we breach any of our material obligations under the agreement or certain credit events occur with respect to us, might make it harder for us to obtain financing from third party lenders on favorable terms.\nWe would be required to make tax gross-up payments to Lone Star if we consummate a corporate inversion or similar transaction that causes payments under the TRA to be subject to withholding taxes.\nIf we were to consummate a change of control transaction that causes us (or our successor) to become a non-U.S. person (e.g., a corporate inversion transaction), and such transaction causes payments under the TRA to become subject to withholding taxes, we would be required under the TRA to make tax gross-up payments to Lone Star in respect of such withholding taxes in amounts that may exceed the tax savings realized by us from the Covered Tax Benefits. Any such tax gross-up payments could have a negative impact on our liquidity and our ability to finance our growth.\nWe are a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, will qualify for, and are relying on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nLone Star controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a controlled company within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the NYSE. Under the NYSE rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by a person or group is a controlled company and need not comply with certain requirements, including the requirement that a majority of the Board consists of independent directors and the requirements that the compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees be composed entirely of independent directors. We are utilizing and, for so long as Lone Star controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, we intend to utilize these exemptions. As a result, among other things, we do not have a majority of independent directors and our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees do not consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nLone Star beneficially owns approximately 65.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock. All shares held by our affiliates are eligible for resale in the public market, subject to applicable securities laws, including the Securities Act. Therefore, unless shares owned by any of our affiliates are registered under the Securities Act, these shares may only be resold into the public markets in accordance with the requirements of an exemption from registration or safe harbor, including Rule 144 and the volume limitations, manner of sale requirements and notice requirements thereof. Lone Star is an affiliate of ours based on its share ownership and representation on our Board. Pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement between Lone Star and us, Lone Star has the right to demand that we register its shares under the Securities Act, as well as the right to include its shares in any registration statement that we file with the SEC subject to certain exceptions. Any registration of Lone Star\u2019s shares would enable those shares to be sold in the public market, subject to certain restrictions in the registration rights agreement. Any sale by Lone Star or other affiliates or any perception in the public markets that such a transaction may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline materially.\nWe have filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering shares under our stock incentive plan. Subject to the terms of the awards pursuant to which these shares may be granted and except for shares held by affiliates who will be subject to the resale restrictions described above, the shares issuable pursuant to our stock incentive plan will be available for sale in the public market.\nWe have no present intention to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have no present intention to pay dividends on our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, projections, liquidity, earnings, legal requirements, restrictions in our credit facilities and agreements governing any other indebtedness we may enter into and other factors that our Board deems relevant. Accordingly, holders of our common stock may need to sell their shares to realize a return on their investment, and may not be able to sell their shares at or above the price paid for them.\nProvisions of our amended and restated governing documents, Delaware law and other documents could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\npermit us to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each series, fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting powers, if any, of the shares of the series and the preferences and other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions, of the shares of the series;\n\u2022\nprevent stockholders from calling special meetings;\n\u2022\nrestrict the ability of stockholders to act by written consent after such time as Lone Star owns less than a majority of our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of stockholders to amend our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice for nominations for election to the Board and for stockholder proposals;\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting in the election of our directors, which means that the holders of the majority of our common stock may elect all of the directors standing for election; and\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms.\nThese provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of our company, including a transaction in which the acquirer may offer a premium price for our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes an exclusive forum clause, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or employees to us or to our stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, will be a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware); in all cases subject to such court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. The exclusive forum clause may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. It is also possible that, notwithstanding such exclusive forum clause, a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable.\nWe may be at increased risk of securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the price of a company\u2019s securities. We believe this risk may be particularly relevant to us as we have recently and in past years experienced significant stock price volatility. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our stock price volatility and the change in our market capitalization during the past year may also result in higher expenses associated with our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance program.", "PERMNO": 16579, "SIC": 5031, "TIC": "FBM"}
