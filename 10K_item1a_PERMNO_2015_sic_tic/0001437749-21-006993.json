{"cik": "1672909", "company": "Canterbury Park Holding Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to our industry and us could materially affect our future performance and results. Management believes the factors described below are the most significant risks that could have a material impact on our business.\nRisk Factors Related to Horse Racing and Gaming Generally\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic has materially adversely affected the number of visitors at our facility and disrupted our operations, and we expect this adverse impact to continue until the COVID-19 Pandemic is contained.\nWe expect the impact of the disruptions resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, including the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results, will be dictated by the length of time such disruptions continue. Although our property is currently open as of this report, we cannot predict whether future closures would be appropriate or could be mandated. Even once capacity restrictions are modified or cease to be necessary, demand for gaming may remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict if or when the gaming and non-gaming activities at our property will return to pre-outbreak levels of volume or pricing. In particular, future demand for gaming may be negatively impacted by the adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, including higher unemployment rates, declines in income levels, and loss of personal wealth or reduced spending resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nOur business would also be impacted should the disruptions from the COVID-19 Pandemic lead to prolonged changes in consumer behavior. There are certain limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of these matters, such as the fixed costs at our properties. The COVID-19 Pandemic also makes it more challenging for management to estimate the future performance of our business, particularly over the near to medium term. Any of these events may continue to disrupt our ability to staff our business adequately, could continue to generally disrupt our operations or development projects and, if the global response to contain the COVID-19 Pandemic escalates or is unsuccessful, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Given the uncertainty around the extent and timing of the potential future spread or mitigation of the COVID-19 Pandemic and around the imposition or relaxation of protective measures, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact on our future results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nWe face significant competition, both directly from other racing and gaming operations and indirectly from other forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe face intense competition in our market, particularly competition from Running Aces in Columbus Township, Anoka County, Minnesota, a racetrack and card room that is located approximately 50 miles from Canterbury Park.\nWe also compete with Native American owned casinos. These Native American facilities have the advantage of being exempt from some state and federal taxes and state regulation of indoor smoking, and have the ability to offer a wider variety of gaming products.\nInternet-based interactive gaming and wagering, both legal and illegal, is growing rapidly and we anticipate competition in this area will become more intense as new Internet-based ventures enter our industry and as state and federal regulations on Internet-based activities are clarified. Additionally, we compete with other forms of gambling, including betting on professional sports, spectator sports, other forms of entertainment, and other racetracks throughout the country.\nWe expect competition for our existing and future operations to increase from Running Aces, existing tribal casinos, and racetracks that are able to subsidize their purses with alternative gaming revenues. Competition for simulcasting customers will be intense given the 2016 legalization of online internet wagering on horse racing in Minnesota, through ADW providers. In addition, several of our tribal gaming competitors in Minnesota have substantially larger marketing and financial resources than we do.\nWe may not be able to attract a sufficient number of horses and trainers to achieve above average field sizes.\nWe believe that patrons prefer to wager on races with a number of horses in the race (the \u201cfield\u201d) at or above the national average. A failure to offer races with adequate fields results in less wagering on our horse races. Our ability to attract adequate fields depends on several factors. First, it depends on our ability to offer and fund competitive purses. Second, it depends on the overall horse population available for racing. Various factors have led to declines in the horse population in some areas of the country, including competition from racetracks in other areas, increased costs, and changing economic returns for owners and breeders, and the spread of various debilitating and contagious equine diseases. If our racetrack is faced with a sustained outbreak of a contagious equine disease, it could have a material impact on our profitability.\nFinally, if we are unable to attract horse owners to stable and race their horses at our racetrack by offering a competitive environment, including high-quality facilities, a well-maintained racetrack, comfortable conditions for backstretch personnel involved in the care and training of horses stabled at our racetrack, and a competitive purse structure, our profitability could also decrease. We also face increased competition for horses and trainers from racetracks that are licensed to operate slot machines and other electronic gaming machines that provide these racetracks an advantage in generating new additional revenues for race purses and capital improvements. While our ability to offer adequate fields to patrons during our live meets has been substantially strengthened by the purse enhancement payments that are scheduled to be made under the CMA through 2022, our inability to attract adequate fields, for whatever reason, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNationally, the popularity of horse racing has declined.\nThere has been a general decline in the number of people wagering on live horse races at North American racetracks, either in person or via simulcasting, due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives as discussed above. According to industry sources, pari-mutuel handle declined 27% from 2007 to 2011 and has been relatively stable since 2011, experiencing less than a 1% decline between 2011 and 2019. Pari-mutuel handle declined more than 1% in 2020 due the COVID-19 Pandemic, and we expect the effects of the pandemic to impact 2021 results as well. Declining interest in horse racing has had a negative impact on revenues and profitability in our racing business. However, as a result of the purse enhancement payments and marketing payments we receive under the CMA, we still expect to outperform the industry as it relates to field size, live handle, and simulcast handle in 2021 and beyond. Regardless, we recognize that a general decline in interest in horse racing and pari-mutuel wagering could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in future years.\nOur horse racing and gaming businesses are sensitive to economic conditions that may affect consumer confidence, consumer discretionary spending, or our access to credit in a manner that adversely affects our operations.\nEconomic trends can affect consumer confidence and consumers\u2019 discretionary spending. Lower consumer confidence or reductions in consumer discretionary spending could result in fewer patrons spending money at our racetrack. Our access to and cost of credit may be affected to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward economic trends. Our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as some of our costs remain fixed or even increase when revenue declines.\nA lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customers.\nThe integrity of horse racing, casino gaming, and pari-mutuel wagering industries must be perceived as fair to patrons and the public at large. To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, oversight processes must be in place to ensure that these activities cannot be manipulated. A loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nHorse racing is an inherently dangerous sport and our racetrack is subject to personal injury litigation.\nAlthough we carry jockey accident insurance at our racetrack to cover personal jockey injuries that may occur during races or daily workouts, there are certain exclusions to our insurance coverage, and we are still subject to litigation from injured participants. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage. Our results may be affected by the outcome of litigation, as this litigation could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nOur business depends on using totalizator services.\nOur customers use information provided by a third party vendor that accumulates wagers, records sales, calculates payoffs, and displays wagering data in a secure manner to patrons who wager on our horse races. Any failure to keep this technology current could limit our ability to serve patrons effectively or develop new forms of wagering or affect the security of the wagering process, thus affecting patron confidence in our product. A perceived lack of integrity in the wagering systems could result in a decline in bettor confidence and could lead to a decline in the amount wagered on horse racing. In addition, a totalizator system failure could cause a considerable loss of revenue if betting machines are unavailable for a significant period of time or during an event with high betting volume.\nInclement weather and other conditions may affect our ability to conduct live racing.\nSince horse racing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be postponed or canceled or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering. Our operations, as well as the racetracks from which we receive simulcast signals, are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions, or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters, and other casualties. If a business interruption were to occur due to inclement weather and continue for a significant length of time at our racetrack, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company maintains insurance for incremental weather conditions that would help mitigate the financial impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with SMSC\nAs discussed above, on June 4, 2012, the Company entered into the CMA with the SMSC. The primary purpose of the CMA is to increase purses paid during live horse racing at Canterbury Park\u2019s Racetrack in order to strengthen Minnesota\u2019s thoroughbred and quarter horse through horse industry. Under the CMA, as amended, this is achieved through \u201cPurse Enhancement Payments to Horsemen\u201d paid directly to the MHBPA. These payments have no direct impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements or operations. Under the CMA, as amended, the SMSC paid the horsemen $7.3 million for purse enhancements for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, with a lower amount in 2020 due to the more limited racing season and fewer races at Canterbury Park.\nIf the Company breaches its obligations under the terms of the agreement, the Company is obligated to repay (1) all amounts paid by SMSC pursuant to the agreement; (2) pay to the SMSC an amount equal to all Horse Association Payments paid by SMSC; and (3) pay to SMSC any additional amounts for any other damages SMSC incurs. The Company has not violated and does not intend to violate its obligations with respect to the agreement. The Company believes the likelihood of a breach of obligations is remote.\nPurse Enhancement Payments and Marketing Payments under our CMA with SMSC may not continue after 2022.\nThe term of the CMA with SMSC ends December 31, 2022, and there is no certainty the CMA can be extended or renegotiated on terms that are mutually acceptable to SMSC, the horsepersons\u2019 associations, and the Company. In particular, there can be no assurance that, after December 31, 2022, SMSC\u2019s purse enhancement payments to the horsepersons\u2019 associations and marketing payments to the Company will continue at the levels currently being paid, if at all. If, by December 31, 2022, the CMA is not extended or renegotiated on economic terms substantially similar to those currently in effect or due to the parties being unable to mutually agree on other terms, the Company\u2019s future revenue from live racing and its profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation of our Horse Racing and Gaming Generally\nWe are subject to changes in the laws that govern our business, including the possibility of an increase in gaming taxes, which would increase our costs, and changes in other laws may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nOur operations and oversight by the MRC are ultimately subject to the laws of Minnesota including, but not limited to, the Minnesota Racing Act, and there exists the risk that these laws may be amended in ways adverse to our operations. In particular, we are required to pay special racing-related and Card-Casino-related taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, and local income taxes. These taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. From time to time, state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of laws affecting our industry, such as the allocation of each wagering pool to winning bettors, the Racetrack, purses, and the MBF. In addition, poor economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes. It is not possible to predict with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of these laws. These changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation from gaming authorities that could adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to significant regulation by the MRC under the Racing Act and the rules adopted by the MRC. The MRC has the authority to increase the Class A and Class B license fees. In addition, the Minnesota Racing Act requires that we reimburse the MRC for its actual costs of regulating the Card Casino, including personnel costs. Increases in these licensing and regulatory costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAmendments to the Minnesota Racing Act or decisions by the MRC in regard to any one or more of the following matters could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations: the granting of operating licenses to Canterbury Park and other racetracks after an application process and public hearings; the licensing of all track employees, jockeys, trainers, veterinarians, and other participants; regulating the transfer of ownership interests in licenses; allocating live race days and simulcast-only race days; approving race programs; regulating the conduct of races; setting specifications for the racing ovals, animal facilities, employee quarters, and public areas of racetracks; changes to the types of wagers on horse races; and approval of significant contractual agreements.\nRisks Related to our Real Estate Development Efforts\nWe rely on the efforts of our partner Doran for the development and profitable operation of our Triple Crown Residences at Canterbury Park joint venture.\nOn April 2, 2018, Canterbury Development entered into an operating agreement with an affiliate of Doran Companies (\u201cDoran\u201d), a national commercial and residential real estate developer, as the two members of a Minnesota limited liability company named Doran Canterbury I, LLC (\u201cDoran Canterbury I\u201d) to construct an upscale apartment complex called the Triple Crown Residences. Construction of the 321-unit first phase began in late 2018 with initial occupancy on June 1, 2020. As of the end of December 2020, all 321 units were available for occupancy.\nIn August 2020, Doran exercised its option for Phase II of the project, which will include an additional 300 residential units, and Canterbury Development entered into a second joint venture agreement with Doran. Pursuant to this second agreement, in early August 2020, the Company transferred roughly 10 acres of land to the second joint venture with Doran. In addition to receiving 27.4% ownership in the Doran Phase II joint venture, the exchange resulted in the repayment of a $2.9 million note receivable which was on the Company\u2019s balance sheet as a related party receivable as of June 30, 2020. Groundwork on the Doran Canterbury II site began in October 2020, paving the way for the ground-up construction of the second phase of apartments, which is anticipated to begin in the spring of 2021.\nCanterbury Development will rely on Doran for the successful leasing and operation of the Triple Crown Residences as well as completion of the second phase of the project.\nWe rely on the efforts of our partner Greystone Construction for a new development project.\nOn June 16, 2020, Canterbury Development entered into an operating agreement with an affiliate of Greystone Construction, as the two members of a Minnesota limited liability company named Canterbury DBSV Development, LLC (Canterbury DBSV). Canterbury DBSV was formed as part of a joint venture between Greystone and Canterbury Development LLC for a multi-use development on the 13-acre land parcel located on the southwest portion of the Company\u2019s racetrack. Canterbury Development\u2019s equity contribution to Canterbury DBSV was approximately 13 acres of land, which were contributed to Canterbury DBSV on July 1, 2020. In connection with its contribution, Canterbury Development became a 61.87% equity member in Canterbury DBSV. The Company will rely on the efforts of our partner Greystone Construction for the success of this new development project.\nWe may not be successful in executing our real estate development strategy.\nCanterbury Development is currently pursuing other opportunities for the commercial development of its underutilized land. The development of residential and commercial real estate involves many risks, including, but not limited to, the selection of development partners; building design and construction; obtaining government permits; financing; securing and retaining tenants; and the volatility of real estate market conditions. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our real estate development activities will be successful.\nWe are obligated to make improvements in the TIF district and will be reimbursed only to the extent of future tax revenue.\nUnder the Redevelopment Agreement with the City of Shakopee, the Company has agreed to undertake a number of specific public infrastructure improvements within the TIF District. The funding that the Company will be paid as reimbursement under the TIF program for these improvements is not guaranteed, but will depend on future tax revenues generated from the developed property.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAn increase in the minimum wage mandated under Federal or Minnesota law could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nThe Company employs a large number of individuals at an hourly wage equal to or slightly above the current state mandated wage of $10.00 per hour for 2020. See \u201cRecent Legislation\u201d above for additional information regarding recently enacted minimum wage legislation. Most of these employees are either high school or college students employed on a seasonal basis or tipped employees, many of whom receive, on average, tip income that is significantly higher than the current minimum wage. From time to time, legislation is introduced in the U.S. Congress or the Minnesota legislature that would substantially increase the minimum wage. Passage of legislation that would substantially increase the minimum wage could have a material adverse impact on the Company.\nWe depend on key personnel.\nOur continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the skills and efforts of our senior executives and management team including Randall D. Sampson, our Chief Executive Officer. We have no employment agreements with our senior executives and key personnel, and we cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us. Their retention is affected by the competitiveness of our terms of employment and our ability to compete effectively against other gaming companies. Our inability to retain key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe payment and amount of future dividends is subject to Board of Director discretion and to various risks and uncertainties.\nThe payment and amount of future quarterly dividends is within the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on factors the Board deems relevant at each time it considers declaring a dividend. These factors include, but are not limited to: available cash; management\u2019s expectations regarding future performance and free cash flow; alternative uses of cash to fund capital expenditures and real estate development; and the effect of various risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit customers\u2019 personal and financial information, credit card information, mailing lists and other information. We have taken steps designed to safeguard our customers\u2019 personal and financial information and have implemented systems designed to meet all requirements of the Payment Card Industry standards for data protection. However, our information and processes are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent access or use by unauthorized individuals. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results. Although we have invested in and deployed security systems and developed processes that are designed to protect all sensitive data, prevent data loss and reduce the impact of any security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security.\nWe process, store, and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nWe receive, store, and process personal information and other customer data. There are numerous federal, state, and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other player data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage specific to cyber-insurance matters, any failure on our part to maintain adequate safeguards may subject us to significant liabilities.\nAdditionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, violate applicable laws or our policies, these violations may also put our customers\u2019 information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. The Company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and penalties. In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.\nWe are also subject to federal and Minnesota laws that affect businesses generally. Some of these laws, such as laws pertaining to immigration, have severe penalties for law violations. In addition, it is possible, as a result of the legislative process, that legislation directly or indirectly adverse to the Company may be enacted into law.\nEnergy and fuel price increases may adversely affect our costs of operations and our revenues.\nOur facility uses significant amounts of electricity, natural gas, and other forms of energy. Increases in the cost of electricity or natural gas negatively affect our results of operations. In addition, energy and fuel price increases could negatively affect our operations by reducing disposable income of potential customers and decreasing visits to our facility.", "PERMNO": 81182, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "CPHC"}
