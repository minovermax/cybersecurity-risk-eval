{"cik": "706688", "company": "AARON'S INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company's business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face, but represent the risks that we believe are material. However, there may be additional risks that we currently consider not to be material or of which we are not currently aware, and any of these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results.\nWe are subject to various existing federal and state laws and regulations which may require us to incur significant compliance costs and expenses associated with government investigations, enforcement actions and private litigation, and we may be subject to new or additional federal and state financial services and consumer protection laws and regulations (or changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations) that could expose us to government investigations, significant compliance costs or burdens or force us to change our business practices in a manner that may be materially adverse to our operations, prospects or financial condition.\nCurrently, nearly every state, the District of Columbia, and most provinces in Canada specifically regulate lease-to-own transactions. This includes states in which we currently operate Aaron's stores, as well as states in which our Progressive business has retail partners. Furthermore, certain aspects of our business, such as our debt collection, customer contact and credit reporting practices are subject to federal and state laws and regulations. Many of these laws and regulations are evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions, and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition to compliance costs, we may incur substantial expenses to respond to government investigations and enforcement actions, proposed fines and penalties, criminal or civil sanctions, and private litigation, arising out of alleged violations of existing laws and/or regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations have and will continue to, and future laws and regulations may, place limitations and restrictions on how we conduct our businesses. While no federal law currently specifically regulates the lease-to-own industry, federal legislation to regulate the industry has been proposed in the past and may be proposed in the future. For example, federal and regulatory authorities such as the CFPB and the FTC are increasingly focused on the subprime financial marketplace in which the lease-to-own industry operates, and may propose and adopt new legislation (or interpret existing regulations) that could result in significant adverse changes in the regulatory landscape for businesses such as ours. In addition, our manufacturing and distribution facilities are subject to various regulations as set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") and Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"). Furthermore, with increasing frequency, federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training, monitoring and compliance. Failure by us or those businesses to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject could result in fines, penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our business, or federal or state actions, or private litigation, any of which could significantly harm our reputation with consumers and Progressive\u2019s and DAMI\u2019s retail and merchant partners and could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nThe risks in Progressive\u2019s virtual lease-to-own business differ in some potentially significant respects from the risks of Aaron\u2019s store-based lease-to-own business. These risks, whether arising from the offer by third party retailers of Progressive\u2019s lease-purchase solution alongside traditional cash, check or credit payment options or otherwise, may also be materially adverse to our operations, prospects or financial condition. Furthermore, Progressive\u2019s business relies on third party retailers (over whom Progressive cannot exercise the degree of control and oversight that Aaron\u2019s and its franchisees can assert over their own respective employees) for many important business functions, from advertising through assistance with lease transaction applications, including, for example, explaining the nature of the lease-to-own transaction when asked to do so by the customer, and that the transaction is with Progressive and not with the third-party retailer. There is the potential that regulators may target virtual lease-to-own transactions and/or implement new legislation (or interpret existing regulations) that could negatively impact Progressive\u2019s ability to offer virtual lease-to-own programs through third party retail partners. Moreover, many of the laws and regulations that apply to the lease-to-own industry were adopted before e-commerce or virtual lease-to-own businesses existed, and thus, may not be appropriate to address the unique characteristics of those more modern lease-to-own business models. Thus, there is the potential that regulators may attempt to force the application of laws and regulations that may be incongruous and outdated in some respects on Progressive's virtual lease-to-own business in inconsistent and unpredictable ways that could increase the compliance-related costs incurred by Progressive, and negatively impact Progressive's financial and operational performance.\nIn addition, as we execute on our strategic plans, we may continue to expand into complementary businesses, such as DAMI, that engage in financial, banking or lending services that are subject to a variety of statutes and regulatory requirements in addition to those regulations currently applicable to our legacy operations, which may impose significant costs, limitations or prohibitions on the manner in which we currently conduct our businesses as well as those we may acquire in the future. Any additional laws or regulations may result in changes in the way our operations are regulated, exposing us to increased regulatory oversight, more burdensome regulations and increased litigation risk, each of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAny proposed rulemaking or enforcement action by the CFPB, the FTC or any other federal or state regulators or other adverse changes in (or interpretations of) existing laws and regulations, the passage of new adverse legislation or regulations by the federal government or the states applicable to our traditional lease-to-own business, our Progressive virtual lease-to-own business, our Aarons.com e-commerce business and any complementary businesses into which we may expand could materially increase both our compliance costs and the risk that we could be subject to government investigations and subject to sanctions if we are not in compliance. In addition, new burdensome laws or regulations could force us to modify our business model, expose us to increased litigation risk, and might reduce the economic potential of our sales and lease ownership operations.\nProgressive\u2019s virtual lease-to-own business differs in some potentially significant respects from the risks of Aaron\u2019s store-based lease-to-own business. The risks could have a material negative effect on Progressive, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business.\nAs discussed above, our Progressive segment offers its lease-to-own solution through the stores of third party retailers. Progressive consequently faces some different risks than are associated with Aaron\u2019s sales and lease ownership concept, which Aaron\u2019s and its franchisees offer through their own stores. These potential risks include, among others, Progressive\u2019s:\n\u2022\nreliance on third party retailers (over whom Progressive cannot exercise the degree of control and oversight that Aaron\u2019s and its franchisees can assert over their own respective employees) for many important business functions, from advertising through assistance with lease transaction applications, including, for example, explaining the nature of the lease-to-own transaction when asked to do so by the customer, and that the transaction is with Progressive and not with the third-party retailer;\n\u2022\nrevenue concentration in the customers of a relatively small number of retailers, as further discussed below;\n\u2022\nlack of control over, and more product diversity within, its lease merchandise inventory relative to Aaron\u2019s business, which can complicate matters such as merchandise repair and disposition of merchandise that is returned;\n\u2022\npossibly different regulatory risks than apply to Aaron\u2019s business, whether arising from the offer by third party retailers of Progressive\u2019s lease-purchase solution alongside traditional cash, check or credit payment options or otherwise, including the risk that regulators may mistakenly treat virtual lease-to-own transactions as some other type of transaction that would face different and more burdensome and complex regulations;\n\u2022\nreliance on automatic bank account drafts for lease payments, which may become disfavored as a payment method for these transactions by regulators;\n\u2022\npotential that regulators may target the virtual lease-to-own transaction and/or adopt new regulations or legislation (or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in a manner) that negatively impact Progressive\u2019s ability to offer virtual lease-to-own programs through third party retail partners;\n\u2022\npotential that regulators may attempt to force the application of laws and regulations on Progressive's virtual lease-to-own business in inconsistent and unpredictable ways that could increase the compliance-related costs incurred by Progressive, and negatively impact Progressive's financial and operational performance; and\n\u2022\nindemnification obligations to Progressive\u2019s retail partners and their service providers for losses stemming from Progressive\u2019s failure to perform with respect to its products and services.\nThese risks could have a material negative effect on Progressive, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business.\nWe continue to implement a strategic plan and there is no guarantee that the strategic plan will produce results superior to those achieved under the Company\u2019s prior plan.\nOur current strategic plan that includes focusing on improving Aaron's store profitability; accelerating our omnichannel platform; promoting communication, coordination and integration; and championing compliance.\nAs part of our efforts to improve the profitability of our Aaron's stores, we recently have focused on identifying and closing underperforming stores and consolidating the customers of those stores into existing, higher performing stores, as opposed to opening new stores, which had traditionally been a central tenet of the Company\u2019s strategy. There can be no guarantee that our current strategy, including our recent focus on identifying and closing underperforming stores, will yield the results we currently anticipate (or results that will exceed those that might be obtained under prior or other strategies), if we fail to successfully execute on one or more elements of our current strategy, even if we successfully implement one or more other components. For example, as part of our efforts to reduce costs and improve profitability, we closed 61 underperforming Company-operated Aaron's stores in the fourth quarter of 2016, and plan to close approximately 70 more locations in the second quarter of 2017. We may not be successful in transitioning the customers of the Company-operated Aaron's stores that are closed to other Company-operated stores that remain open, and thus, could experience a reduction in revenue and profits\nassociated with such a loss of customers. In addition, the estimated costs and charges associated with these initiatives may vary materially and adversely based upon various factors, including the timing of execution, the outcome of negotiations with landlords and other third parties, or unexpected costs, any of which could result in our not realizing the anticipated benefits from our strategic plan.\nWe may not fully execute on one or more elements of our current strategy due to any number of reasons, including, for instance, because of the division of management, financial and Company resources among multiple objectives, or other factors beyond or not completely within our control. The successful execution of our current strategy depends on, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nimprove same store revenues and profitability in stores that may be maturing;\n\u2022\ndrive recurring cost savings to recapture margin;\n\u2022\nidentify and close underperforming stores, and transition the customers of those stores to other stores that remain open;\n\u2022\nstrengthen our franchise network; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully manage and grow our Aarons.com e-commerce platform.\nIf we cannot address these challenges successfully, or overcome other critical obstacles that may emerge as we continue to pursue our current strategy, we may not be able to achieve our revenue or profitability goals at the rates we currently contemplate, if at all.\nOur Aaron's business faces many challenges which could materially and adversely affect our overall results of operations.\nOur traditional lease-to-own store-based (\"Aaron's\") business faces a number of challenges, particularly from the continued expansion of digital retail, which includes a wide array of e-commerce retailers that have established far larger digital operations than our Aarons.com e-commerce platform has been able to achieve to date. Increasing competition from the digital sector, as well as more competitive pricing offered by traditional retailers, may reduce the market share held by our Aaron's business as well as its operating margins, and may materially and adversely affect our overall results of operations. Furthermore, as our Progressive virtual lease-to-own solution continues to partner with traditional retailers, including possibly \"big box\" retailers, those retailers may increasingly compete with our Aaron's business, including our franchisees. In addition, we believe a portion of our Aaron's business customer base continues to experience significant economic challenges, including stagnant or decreasing incomes in certain areas, such as those where the oil and gas industries have experienced economic headwinds, and those challenges may result in those customers of our Aaron's business curtailing entering into sales and lease ownership agreements for the types of merchandise we offer, or entering into agreements that generate less revenue for us, resulting in lower same store sales, revenue and profits. For example, our Company-operated stores experienced same store revenue declines of 3.4% and 4.1% in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, our franchised stores experienced same store revenue declines of 2.2% and 0.9% in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. We calculate same store revenue growth by comparing revenues for comparable periods for stores open during the entirety of those periods. A number of factors have historically affected our same store revenues for our Aaron's business, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in competition, particularly from the digital sector;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\neconomic challenges faced by our customer base;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions;\n\u2022\nconsumer trends;\n\u2022\nchanges in our merchandise mix;\n\u2022\ntiming of promotional events; and\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our business strategy effectively.\nIf our Aaron's business is unable to successfully address these challenges, our overall business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected as well.\nContinuation or worsening of current economic conditions faced by a portion of our Aaron's business's customer base could result in decreased revenues, same store sales and profitability and increased costs. The geographic concentration of our Aaron's stores, as well as those of Progressive\u2019s retail partners, may magnify the impact of conditions in a particular region, including economic downturns and other occurrences.\nMuch of our Aaron's business customer base continues to experience prolonged economic uncertainty and, in certain areas, unfavorable economic conditions. We believe that the extended duration of that economic uncertainty and unfavorable economic conditions, may be resulting in our customers curtailing entering into sales and lease ownership agreements for the types of merchandise we offer, or entering into agreements that generate smaller amounts of revenue for us, resulting in decreased same store sales and revenues for our Aaron's business. Any increases in unemployment or underemployment within our customer base may result in increased defaults on lease payments, resulting in increased merchandise return costs and merchandise losses.\nThe concentration of our Aaron's stores, and/or those of our retail partners at Progressive, in one region or a limited number of markets may expose us to risks of adverse economic developments that are greater than if our store portfolio and retail partners were more geographically diverse. For example, during 2016, 17.9% of our Aaron's business store-based revenues were generated in Texas. Given our concentration of stores in Texas, the downturn and prolonged uncertainty in the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse effect on our overall business.\nIn addition, our store operations, as well as those of our retail partners at Progressive, are subject to the effects of adverse acts of nature, such as winter storms, hurricanes, hail storms, strong winds, earthquakes and tornadoes, which have in the past caused damage such as flooding and other damage to our stores and those of our retail partners in specific geographic locations. Additionally, we cannot assure you that the amount of our hurricane, windstorm, earthquake, flood, business interruption or other casualty insurance we maintain from time to time would entirely cover damages caused by any such event.\nWe could lose our access to data sources, which could cause us competitive harm and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are heavily dependent on data provided by third party providers. For example, our Progressive business employs a proprietary decisioning algorithm when making lease approval decisions for its customers. This algorithm depends extensively upon continued access to and receipt of data from external sources, such as third party data vendors. In addition, our Aarons.com and DAMI businesses are similarly dependent on customer attribute data provided by external sources. Our data providers could stop providing data, provide untimely, incorrect or incomplete data, or increase the costs for their data for a variety of reasons, including a perception that our systems are insecure as a result of a data security breach, regulatory concerns or for competitive reasons. We could also become subject to increased legislative, regulatory or judicial restrictions or mandates on the collection, disclosure or use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by our providers in a way that allows us to legally use the data. If we were to lose access to this external data or if our access or use were restricted or were to become less economical or desirable, our Progressive, Aarons.com and DAMI businesses would be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in maintaining our relationships with these external data source providers or that we will be able to continue to obtain data from them on acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable.\nOur proprietary algorithms and decisioning tools used to approve customers could no longer be indicative of our customer\u2019s ability to pay.\nWe believe Progressive\u2019s proprietary, centralized underwriting process to be a key to the success of the Progressive business. That and other underwriting processes and tools are also used to approve customers of Aaron's and DAMI. We assume behavior and attributes observed for prior customers, among other factors, are indicative of performance by future customers. Unexpected changes in behavior caused by macroeconomic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, availability of alternative products or other factors, however, could lead to increased incidence and costs related to unpaid leases and/or merchandise losses.\nProgressive\u2019s loss of operating revenues from key retail partners could materially and adversely affect our business.\nProgressive\u2019s relationship with its largest retail partners will have a significant impact on our operating revenues in future periods. The loss of any such key retailers would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of Progressive\u2019s large retail partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain consumers and other retail partners, and could lessen Progressive\u2019s negotiating power with its remaining and prospective retail partners.\nMany of Progressive\u2019s contracts with its retail partners can be terminated by them on relatively short notice, and all can be terminated in limited circumstances, such as our material breach or insolvency, our failure to meet agreed-upon service levels,\ncertain changes in control of Progressive, and its inability or unwillingness to agree to requested pricing changes. There can be no assurance that Progressive will be able to continue its relationships with its largest retail partners on the same or more favorable terms in future periods or that its relationships will continue beyond the terms of our existing contracts with them. Our operating revenues and operating results could suffer if, among other things, any of Progressive\u2019s retail partners renegotiates, terminates or fails to renew, or fails to renew on similar or favorable terms, their agreements with Progressive or otherwise chooses to modify the level of support they provide for Progressive\u2019s lease-purchase option.\nIf our independent franchisees fail to meet their debt service payments or other obligations under outstanding loans guaranteed by us as part of a franchise loan program, we may be required to pay to satisfy these obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe have guaranteed the borrowings of certain franchisees under a franchise loan program with several banks with a maximum commitment amount of $125.0 million. In the event these franchisees are unable to meet their debt service payments or otherwise experience events of default, we would be unconditionally liable for a portion of the outstanding balance of the franchisees\u2019 debt obligations, which at December 31, 2016 was $56.7 million.\nWe have had no significant losses associated with the franchise loan and guaranty program since its inception. Although we believe that any losses associated with defaults would be mitigated through recovery of lease merchandise and other assets, we cannot guarantee that there will be no significant losses in the future or that we will be able to adequately mitigate any such losses. In addition to being liable for franchisee loan defaults under this loan and guaranty program, we could suffer a loss of franchisee fees and royalties in the event that any defaulting franchisees become insolvent and/or cease business operations due to financial difficulties, and could suffer write-downs of outstanding receivables those franchisees owe us if they fail to make those payments to us. If we fail to adequately mitigate any such future losses, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.\nOperational and other failures by our franchisees may adversely impact us.\nQualified franchisees who conform to our standards and requirements are important to the overall success of our business. Our franchisees, however, are independent businesses and not employees, and consequently we cannot and do not control them to the same extent as our Company-operated stores. Our franchisees may fail in key areas, or experience significant business or financial difficulties, which could slow our growth, reduce our franchise revenues, damage our reputation, expose us to regulatory enforcement actions or private litigation and/or cause us to incur additional costs. If our franchisees experience business or financial difficulties, we could suffer a loss of franchisee fees and royalties and could suffer write-downs of outstanding receivables those franchisees owe us if they fail to make those payments to us. If we fail to adequately mitigate any such future losses, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.\nFailure to successfully manage and grow our Aarons.com e-commerce platform could materially adversely affect our business and future prospects.\nOur Aarons.com e-commerce platform provides customers the ability to review our product offerings and prices and enter into lease agreements as well as make payments on existing leases from the comfort of their homes and on their mobile devices. Our e-commerce platform is a significant component of our strategic plan and we believe will drive future growth of our business. In order to promote our products and services and allow customers to transact online and reach new customers, we must effectively maintain, improve and grow our e-commerce platform. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain, improve or grow our e-commerce platform in a profitable manner.\nDAMI\u2019s \"second-look\" credit programs for below-prime consumers differ in significant respects from the risks of Aaron\u2019s store-based lease-to-own business. The risks could have a material negative effect on Progressive, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business.\nAs discussed above, as we execute on our strategic plans, we may continue to expand into complementary businesses that engage in financial, banking or lending services. For example, DAMI, which through its HELPcard\u00ae and other private label credit products, offers merchant partners one source for a variety of open-end credit programs for below-prime consumers, is a business that differs in significant respects from our Aaron's business. Consequently, DAMI faces different risks than are associated with Aaron\u2019s sales and lease ownership concept, which Aaron\u2019s and its franchisees offer through their own stores. Because DAMI is operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Progressive, the risks DAMI faces could have a material negative effect on Progressive, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business. These potential risks include, among others, DAMI\u2019s:\n\u2022\nreliance on third party retailers (over whom DAMI cannot exercise the degree of control and oversight that Aaron\u2019s business, including franchisees, can assert over their own respective employees) for many important business functions, from advertising through assistance with finance applications;\n\u2022\nreliance on two bank partners to issue DAMI\u2019s HELPcard\u00ae and other credit products. The banks' regulators could at any time limit or otherwise modify the banks' ability to continue their relationships with DAMI and any significant interruption of those relationships would result in DAMI being unable to use exported rates or acquire new receivables without moving to a costly and inefficient state-by-state model, and provide other credit products. It is possible that a regulatory position or action taken with respect to DAMI\u2019s issuing banks might result in the banks' inability or unwillingness to originate future credit products on DAMI\u2019s behalf or in partnership with it, which would adversely affect DAMI\u2019s ability to grow its point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer credit products and other consumer credit offerings and underlying receivables. In addition, DAMI\u2019s agreements with its issuing bank partners have scheduled expiration dates. Although those expiration dates are several months apart, if DAMI is unable to extend or execute new agreements with both of its issuing banks upon the expiration of its current agreements, or if its existing agreements both were terminated or otherwise disrupted, there is a risk that DAMI would not be able to enter into an agreement with an alternative bank provider on terms that DAMI would consider favorable or in a timely manner without disruption of its business; and\n\u2022\ndifferent legal and regulatory risks than those applicable to Aaron\u2019s and Progressive's sales and lease ownership businesses, including risks arising from the Truth in Lending Act, state credit laws and the offering of open-end credit, the potential that regulators may target DAMI\u2019s operating model and the interest rates it charges, and the risk of unfavorable court decisions relating to the exporting of interest rates and state usury laws.\nThese risks could have a material negative effect on Progressive, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, particularly with respect to our Progressive and DAMI businesses, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, or report them in a timely manner.\nAs a public reporting company subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, we are required to, among other things, establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 so that our management can certify, on an annual basis, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nPrior to their acquisition by us, our Progressive and DAMI businesses were private companies and were not required to establish disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, unlike our Aaron's business, these businesses have not historically operated under a fully documented and annually tested system for internal control over financial reporting that is required for public companies by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures - particularly in our Progressive and DAMI businesses - we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, or report them in a timely manner, which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if our senior management is unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or to certify the effectiveness of such controls, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, when required, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public and investor confidence, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price.\nIf we do not maintain the privacy and security of customer, employee, supplier or Company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\nOur business involves the collection, storage and transmission of customers\u2019 personal information, consumer preferences and credit card information, as well as confidential information about our customers, employees, suppliers and Company. We also serve as an information technology provider to our franchisees including storing and processing information related to their customers on our systems. Our information systems are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of employee or customer data, could significantly damage our reputation, cause the disclosure of confidential customer, associate, supplier or Company information, and result in significant costs, lost revenues or sales, fines, regulatory enforcement actions and lawsuits. For example, we are currently subject to settlements with the FTC as well as the State of California and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regarding our business practices and compliance with privacy laws in those states, and data breaches of this nature could result in additional penalties under the terms of those settlements.\nVarious third parties, including computer hackers, may attempt to penetrate our network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or employee and/or supplier information. In addition, one of our employees, contractors\nor other third parties with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. While we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuse of the data. The regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. These costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with privacy laws, and costs incurred to prevent or remediate information security breaches, could be substantial and adversely impact our business.\nWe have experienced security incidents in the past, including an incident in which customer information was compromised, although no security incidents have resulted in a material loss to date. We have been and are continuously in the process of improving our system security, although there can be no assurance that improvements we have already implemented, or others that we may implement from time to time in the future, will be effective to prevent all security incidents. We maintain network security and private liability insurance intended to help mitigate the financial risk of such incidents, but there can be no guarantee that insurance will be sufficient to cover all losses related to such incidents.\nA significant compromise of sensitive employee or customer or supplier information in our possession could result in legal damages and regulatory penalties. In addition, the costs of defending such actions or remediating breaches could be material. Security breaches could also harm our reputation with our customers and retail partners, potentially leading to decreased revenues.\nIf our information technology systems are impaired, our business could be interrupted, our reputation could be harmed and we may experience lost revenues and increased costs and expenses.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to process transactions with our customers, including tracking lease payments on merchandise, and to manage other important functions of our business. Failures of our systems, such as \"bugs,\" crashes, internet failures and outages, operator error or catastrophic events, could seriously impair our ability to operate our business, and our business continuity and contingency plans related to such information technology failures may not be adequate to prevent that type of serious impairment. If our information technology systems are impaired, our business (and that of our franchisees) could be interrupted, our reputation could be harmed, we may experience lost revenues or sales and we could experience increased costs and expenses to remediate the problem.\nWe are subject to laws that regulate franchisor-franchisee relationships. Our ability to enforce our rights against our franchisees may be adversely affected by these laws, which could impair our growth strategy and cause our franchise revenues to decline.\nAs a franchisor, we are subject to regulation by the FTC, state laws and certain Canadian provincial laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Our failure to comply with applicable franchise regulations could cause us to lose franchise fees and ongoing royalty revenues. Moreover, state and provincial laws that regulate substantive aspects of our relationships with franchisees may limit our ability to terminate or otherwise resolve conflicts with our franchisees or enforce contractual duties or rights we believe we have with respect to our franchisees.\nWe may engage in litigation with our franchisees.\nAlthough we believe we generally enjoy a positive working relationship with the vast majority of our franchisees, the nature of the franchisor-franchisee relationship may give rise to litigation with our franchisees. In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of complaints or litigation from franchisees, usually related to alleged breaches of contract or wrongful termination under the franchise arrangements. We may also engage in future litigation with franchisees to enforce the terms of our franchise agreements and compliance with our brand standards as determined necessary to protect our brand, the consistency of our products and the customer experience. In addition, we may be subject to claims by our franchisees relating to our FDD, including claims based on financial information contained in our FDD. Engaging in such litigation may be costly, time-consuming and may distract management and materially adversely affect our relationships with franchisees and our ability to attract new franchisees. Any negative outcome of these or any other claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations as well as our ability to expand our franchise system and may damage our reputation and brand. Furthermore, existing and future franchise-related legislation could subject us to additional litigation risk in the event we terminate or fail to renew a franchise relationship.\nChanges to the current law with respect to the assignment of liabilities in the franchise business model could adversely impact our profitability.\nOne of the legal foundations fundamental to the franchise business model has been that, absent special circumstances, a franchisor is generally not responsible for the acts, omissions or liabilities of its franchisees. Recently, established law has been\nchallenged and questioned by the plaintiffs\u2019 bar and certain regulators, and the outcome of these challenges and new regulatory positions remains unknown. If these challenges and/or new positions are successful in altering currently settled law, it could significantly change the way we and other franchisors conduct business and adversely impact our profitability.\nFor example, a determination that we are a joint employer with our franchisees or that franchisees are part of one unified system with joint and several liability under the National Labor Relations Act, statutes administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, OSHA, regulations and other areas of labor and employment law could subject us and/or our franchisees to liability for the unfair labor practices, wage-and-hour law violations, employment discrimination law violations, OSHA regulation violations and other employment-related liabilities of one or more franchisees. Furthermore, any such change in law would create an increased likelihood that certain franchised networks would be required to employ unionized labor, which could impact franchisors like us through, among other things, increased labor costs and difficulty in attracting new franchisees. In addition, if these changes were to be expanded outside of the employment context, we could be held liable for other claims against franchisees. Therefore, any such regulatory action or court decisions could impact our ability or desire to grow our franchised base and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFrom time to time we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings which seek material damages or seek to place significant restrictions on our business operations. These proceedings may be negatively perceived by the public and materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings from time to time which may result in material damages or place significant restrictions on our business operations. For example, we are currently subject to settlements with the FTC as well as the State of California and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regarding our business practices and compliance with privacy laws in those states. Although we do not presently believe that any of our current legal or regulatory proceedings will ultimately have a material adverse impact on our operations, we cannot assure you that we will not incur material damages or penalties in a lawsuit or other proceeding in the future and/or significant defense costs related to such lawsuits or proceedings. For example, we operate a fleet of approximately 3,000 delivery trucks and, in addition to the significant compliance-related costs associated with operating such a fleet, we may incur significant adverse judgments, damages and penalties related to accidents that those trucks may be involved in from time to time. Significant adverse judgments, penalties, settlement amounts, amounts needed to post a bond pending an appeal or defense costs could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. It is also possible that, as a result of a future governmental or other proceeding or settlement, significant restrictions will be placed upon, or significant changes made to, our business practices, operations or methods, including pricing or similar terms. Any such restrictions or changes may adversely affect our profitability or increase our compliance costs.\nThe transactions offered to consumers by our businesses may be negatively characterized by consumer advocacy groups, the media and certain federal, state and local government officials, and if those negative characterizations become increasingly accepted by consumers and/or Progressive\u2019s or DAMI\u2019s retail partners, demand for our goods and the transactions we offer could decrease and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nCertain consumer advocacy groups, media reports and federal and state legislators have asserted that laws and regulations should be broader and more restrictive regarding lease-to-own transactions. The consumer advocacy groups and media reports generally focus on the total cost to a consumer to acquire an item, which is often alleged to be higher than the interest typically charged by banks or similar lending institutions to consumers with better credit histories. This \"cost-of-rental\" amount, which is generally defined as lease fees paid in excess of the \"retail\" price of the goods, is from time to time characterized by consumer advocacy groups and media reports as predatory or abusive without discussing benefits associated with our lease-to-own programs or the lack of viable alternatives for our customers\u2019 needs. If the negative characterization of these types of lease-to-own transactions becomes increasingly accepted by consumers or Progressive\u2019s or DAMI\u2019s retail and merchant partners, demand for our products and services could significantly decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, if the negative characterization of these types of transactions is accepted by legislators and regulators, we could become subject to more restrictive laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The vast expansion and reach of technology, including social media platforms, has increased the risk that our reputation could be significantly impacted by these negative characterizations in a relatively short amount of time. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such characterizations, we may experience declines in customer loyalty and traffic and our relationships with our retail partners may suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of the services of our key executives, or our inability to attract and retain key technical talent in the areas of IT and analytics, could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nWe believe that we have benefited substantially from our current executive leadership and that the unexpected loss of their services in the future could adversely affect our business and operations. We also depend on the continued services of the rest of our management team. The loss of these individuals without adequate replacement could adversely affect our business.\nFurther, we believe that the unexpected loss of certain key technical talent in the areas of information technology and analytics in the future could adversely affect our business and operations. We do not carry key man life insurance on any of our personnel. The inability to attract and retain qualified individuals, or a significant increase in the costs to do so, would materially adversely affect our operations.\nOur competitors could impede our ability to attract new customers, or cause current customers to cease doing business with us.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and highly fluid, particularly in light of the sweeping new regulatory environment we are witnessing from regulators such as the CFPB and the FTC, among others, as discussed above.\nIn the sales and lease ownership market, our competitors include national, regional and local operators of lease-to-own stores, virtual lease-to-own companies, traditional and e-commerce retailers (including many retailers who offer layaway programs) and, indirectly, various types of consumer finance companies that may enable our customers to shop at traditional or on-line retailers, as well as rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. Our competitors in the traditional and virtual sales and lease ownership and traditional retail markets may have significantly greater financial and operating resources and greater name recognition in certain markets. Greater financial resources may allow our competitors to grow faster than us, including through acquisitions. This in turn may enable them to enter new markets before we can, which may decrease our opportunities in those markets. Greater name recognition, or better public perception of a competitor\u2019s reputation, may help them divert market share away from us, even in our established markets. Some competitors may be willing to offer competing products on an unprofitable basis in an effort to gain market share, which could compel us to match their pricing strategy or lose business.\nOur Progressive business relies heavily on relationships with retail partners. An increase in competition could cause our retail partners to no longer offer the Progressive product in favor of our competitors which could slow growth in the Progressive business and limit profitability.\nIn addition, as a result of changes to the regulatory framework within which we operate, among other reasons, new competitors may emerge or current and potential competitors may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. The occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely impact our business.\nWe depend on hiring an adequate number of hourly employees to run our business and are subject to government regulations concerning these and our other employees, including wage and hour regulations.\nOur workforce is comprised primarily of employees who work on an hourly basis. To grow our operations and meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train, and retain a large number of hourly associates, while at the same time controlling labor costs. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training, retention and other costs. In certain areas where we operate, there is significant competition for employees, including from retailers and the restaurant industries. The lack of availability of an adequate number of hourly employees, or our inability to attract and retain them, or an increase in wages and benefits to current employees could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We are subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees, including wage and hour regulations, health benefits, unemployment and payroll taxes, overtime and working conditions and immigration status. Accordingly, federal, state or local legislated increases in the minimum wage, as well as increases in additional labor cost components such as employee benefit costs, workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates, compliance costs and fines, would increase our labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur stock price is volatile, and you may not be able to recover your investment if our stock price declines.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and can be expected to be significantly affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nour ability to meet market expectations with respect to the growth and profitability of each of our operating segments;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations, which may be impacted by, among other things, changes in same store revenues or when and how many locations we acquire or open;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022\nstate or federal legislative or regulatory proposals, initiatives, actions or changes that are, or are perceived to be, adverse to our operations;\n\u2022\nthe stock price performance of comparable companies; and\n\u2022\ncontinuing unpredictable global and regional economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market as a whole historically has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many specialty retailers in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance.\nWe are subject to sales, income and other taxes, which can be difficult and complex to calculate due to the nature of our various businesses. A failure to correctly calculate and pay such taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities and a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales tax, is a complex and evolving issue, particularly with respect to the lease-to-own industry generally and our virtual lease-to-own Progressive and Aarons.com businesses more specifically. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the lease-to-own industry and e-commerce and, therefore, in many cases it is not clear how existing statutes apply to our various businesses. In addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenues, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenues, including through indirect taxes. This also could result in other adverse changes in or interpretations of existing sales, income and other tax regulations. For example, from time to time, some taxing authorities in the United States have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes imposed on transactions with our customers, including some state tax authorities suggesting that our Progressive business may owe certain state taxes based on the locations of Progressive's retail partners where Progressive's lease-to-own transactions are originated. Although these notifications have not resulted in material tax liabilities to date, there is a risk that one or more jurisdictions may be successful in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe must successfully order and manage our Aaron's business inventory to reflect customer demand and anticipate changing consumer preferences and buying trends or our revenue and profitability will be adversely affected.\nThe success of our Aaron's business depends upon our ability to successfully manage our inventory and to anticipate and respond to merchandise trends and customer demands in a timely manner. We cannot always accurately predict consumer preferences and they may change over time. We must order certain types of merchandise, such as electronics, well in advance of seasonal increases in customer demand for those products. The extended lead times for many of our purchases may make it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or changes in prices. If we misjudge either the market for our merchandise, our customers' product preferences or our customers\u2019 leasing habits, our revenue may decline significantly and we may not have sufficient quantities of merchandise to satisfy customer demand or we may be required to mark down excess inventory, either of which would result in lower profit margins. In addition, our level of profitability and success in our Aaron's business depends on our ability to successfully re-lease or sale our inventory of merchandise that we take back from the customers of our Aaron's business, due to their lease agreements expiring, or otherwise.\nWe may pursue strategic alliances, acquisitions or investments and the failure of an alliance, acquisition or investment to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe may from time to time acquire or invest in complementary companies or businesses, as we have done in recent years. The success of such acquisitions or investments is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, operations, growth potential, integration and other factors relating to the respective business. There can be no assurance that our acquisitions or investments will produce the results that we expect at the time we enter into or complete the transaction. Furthermore, acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill or other intangibles, any of which could harm our financial condition. We also may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, supply chain and other operations, which could adversely affect our business. Acquisitions may also result in the diversion of our capital and our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities.\nProduct safety and quality control issues, including product recalls, could harm our reputation, divert resources, reduce sales and increase costs.\nThe products we sell and lease in our Aaron's business and lease through our Progressive business are subject to regulation by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state regulatory authorities. Such products could be subject to recalls and other actions by these authorities. Product safety or quality concerns may require us to voluntarily remove selected products from our Aaron's stores, or from our customers\u2019 homes. Such recalls and voluntary removal of products can result in, among other things, lost sales, diverted resources, potential harm to our reputation and increased customer service costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, given the terms of our lease agreements with our customers, in the event of such a product quality or safety issue, our customers who have leased the defective merchandise from us could terminate their lease agreements for that merchandise and/or not renew those lease arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, if we are unable to recover those losses from the vendor who supplied us with the defective merchandise.\nEmployee misconduct or misconduct by third parties acting on our behalf could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\nOur reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees or the employees of a third party retailer with whom our Progressive business partners, or of a third party merchant with whom our DAMI segment does business, could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our reputation and business. For example, if an employee or a third party associated with our business were to engage in, or be accused of engaging in, illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft of our customers\u2019 information, we could suffer direct losses from the activity and, in addition, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships and ability to attract future customers. Employee or third-party misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine based upon such misconduct that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect violations of such rules. Our Company-operated Aaron's stores have experienced employee fraud from time to time, and it is not always possible to deter employee or third-party misconduct. The precautions that we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees or third party contractors, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.", "PERMNO": 78049, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "AAN"}
