{"cik": "81362", "company": "QUAKER CHEMICAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nChanges to the industries and markets that Quaker serves could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nThe chemical specialty industry comprises a number of companies of similar size as well as companies larger and smaller than Quaker. It is estimated that Quaker holds a leading and significant global position in the markets for process fluids to produce sheet steel and significant global positions in portions of the automotive and industrial markets. The industry is highly competitive, and a number of companies with significant financial resources and/or customer relationships compete with us to provide similar products and services. Our competitors may be positioned to offer more favorable pricing and service terms, resulting in reduced profitability and a loss of market share for us. In addition, several competitors could potentially consolidate their businesses to gain scale to better position their product offerings, which could have a negative impact to our profitability and market share. Historically, competition in the industry has been based primarily on the ability to provide products that meet the needs of the customer and render technical services and laboratory assistance to the customer and, to a lesser extent, on price. Factors critical to the Company\u2019s business include successfully differentiating the Company\u2019s offering from its competition, operating efficiently and profitably as a globally integrated whole, and increasing market share and customer penetration through internally developed business programs and strategic acquisitions.\nThe business environment in which the Company operates remains uncertain. The Company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by steel, automobile, aircraft, appliance, and durable goods manufacturers. A major risk is that the Company\u2019s demand is largely derived from the demand for its customers\u2019 products, which subjects the Company to uncertainties related to downturns in our customers\u2019 business and unanticipated customer production shutdowns or curtailments. The Company has limited ability to adjust its cost level contemporaneously with changes in sales and gross margins. Thus, a significant downturn in sales or gross margins due to weak end-user markets, loss of a significant customer, and/or rising raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position, and results of operations.\nOur business depends on attracting and retaining qualified management personnel.\nThe unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. Given the relative size of the Company and the breadth of its global operations, there are a limited number of qualified management personnel to assume the responsibilities of management level employees, should there be turnover. In addition, because of the specialized and technical nature of our business, our future performance is dependent on the continued service of, and our ability to attract and retain, qualified management, commercial and technical personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel. In an effort to mitigate such risks, the Company utilizes retention bonuses, offers competitive pay and maintains continued succession planning, but there can be no assurance that these mitigating factors will be adequate to attract or retain qualified management personnel.\nInability to obtain sufficient price increases or contract concessions to offset increases in the costs of raw material could result in a loss of sales and/or market share and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations. Conversely, an inability to implement timely price decreases to compensate for changes in raw material costs could result in a loss of sales and/or market share and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nQuaker uses over 1,000 raw materials, including mineral oils and derivatives, animal fats and derivatives, vegetable oils and derivatives, ethylene derivatives, solvents, surface active agents, chlorinated paraffinic compounds, and a wide variety of other organic and inorganic compounds. In 2014, three raw material groups (mineral oils and derivatives, animal fats and derivatives, and vegetable oils and derivatives) each accounted for at least 10% of the total cost of Quaker\u2019s raw material purchases. The price of mineral oils and derivatives can be affected by crude oil pricing and their refining capacity. In addition, many of the raw materials used by Quaker are \u201ccommodity\u201d chemicals. Accordingly, Quaker\u2019s earnings can be impacted by market changes in raw material prices.\nIn the past, Quaker has experienced volatility in its raw material costs, particularly crude oil derivatives. In addition, refining capacity can be constrained by various factors, which can further contribute to volatile raw material costs and negatively impact margins. Animal fat and vegetable oil prices also can be impacted by increased biodiesel consumption. Although the Company has been successful in the past in recovering a substantial amount of the raw material cost increases while retaining its customers, there can be no assurance that the Company can continue to recover higher raw material costs or retain customers in the future. Conversely, the Company has been successful in maintaining acceptable levels of margin in periods of raw material decline, but there can be no assurance that the Company can continue to maintain its margins, through appropriate price and contract concessions, while retaining all customers in the future. As a result of the Company\u2019s past pricing actions, in periods of rising and declining costs, customers may become more likely to consider competitors\u2019 products, some of which may be available at a lower cost. A significant loss of customers could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAvailability of raw materials, including sourcing from some single suppliers and some suppliers in volatile economic environments, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nThe chemical specialty industry can experience some tightness of supply for certain raw materials. In addition, in some cases, we choose to source from a single supplier and/or suppliers in economies that have experienced instability. Any significant disruption in supply could affect our ability to obtain raw materials, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the Company\u2019s raw materials are subject to various regulatory laws, and a change in the ability to legally use such raw materials may impact Quaker\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nLoss of a significant manufacturing facility may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nQuaker has multiple manufacturing facilities throughout the world. In certain countries, such as Brazil and China, there is only one such facility. If one of the Company\u2019s facilities is damaged to such extent that production is halted for an extended period, the Company may not be able to timely supply its customers. This could result in a loss of sales over an extended period or permanently. The Company does take steps to mitigate against this risk, including contingency planning and procuring property and casualty insurance (including business interruption insurance). Nevertheless, the loss of sales in any one region over any extended period of time could have a significant material adverse effect on Quaker\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nBankruptcy of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nA significant portion of Quaker\u2019s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the steel and automotive industries; including some of our larger customers, where a number of bankruptcies have occurred in the past and where companies have experienced financial difficulties. As part of the bankruptcy process, the Company\u2019s pre-petition receivables may not be realized, customer manufacturing sites may be closed or contracts voided. The bankruptcy of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations. Steel customers typically have limited manufacturing locations as compared to metalworking customers and generally use higher volumes of products at a single location. The loss or closure of one or more steel mills or other major sites of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on Quaker\u2019s business.\nDuring 2014, our five largest customers (each composed of multiple subsidiaries or divisions with semi-autonomous purchasing authority) together accounted for approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales, with the largest customer (Arcelor-Mittal Group) accounting for approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales.\nFailure to comply with any material provision of our credit facility or other debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company maintains a $300.0 million unsecured multicurrency credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with a group of lenders, which can be increased to $400.0 million at the Company\u2019s option if lenders agree to increase their commitments and the Company satisfies certain conditions. The Credit Facility, which matures in 2018, provides the availability of revolving credit borrowings. In general, the borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at either a base rate or LIBOR rate plus a margin based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio.\nThe Credit Facility contains certain limitations on investments, acquisitions and liens, as well as default provisions customary for facilities of its type. While these covenants and restrictions are not currently considered to be overly restrictive, they could become more difficult to comply with as our business or financial conditions change. In addition, deterioration in the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial position could significantly increase borrowing costs.\nQuaker is exposed to market rate risk for changes in interest rates, due to the variable interest rate applied to the Company\u2019s borrowings under its Credit Facility. Accordingly, if interest rates rise significantly, the cost of debt to Quaker will increase, perhaps significantly, depending on the extent of Quaker\u2019s borrowings under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2014, the Company had $58.4 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. Incorporated by reference is the interest rate risk information contained in Item 7A of this report.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and/or pending and future legal proceedings may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position, results of operations and reputation in the markets it serves.\nThe Company is a party to proceedings, cases, and requests for information from, and negotiations with, various claimants and Federal and state agencies relating to various matters, including environmental matters. An adverse result in one or more matters or any potential future matter of a similar nature could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position, results of operations and reputation in the markets it serves. Incorporated herein by reference is the information concerning pending asbestos-related litigation against an inactive subsidiary, amounts accrued associated with certain environmental non-capital remediation costs and other potential commitments or contingencies highlighted in Note 23, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\nCompliance with a complex global regulatory environment could have an impact on the Company\u2019s public perception and/or a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in the Company\u2019s regulatory environment, particularly, but not limited to, the United States, Brazil, China and the European Union, could lead to heightened regulatory scrutiny, could adversely impact our ability to continue selling certain products in our domestic or foreign markets and could increase the cost of doing business. For instance, the European Union\u2019s Registration, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d and analogous non-E.U. laws and regulations), or other similar laws and regulations, could result in fines, ongoing monitoring and other future business activity restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations. In addition, non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the UK Bribery Act and other similar laws and regulations, could result in a negative impact to the Company\u2019s reputation, potential fines or ongoing monitoring, which could also have an adverse effect on the Company.\nClimate change and greenhouse gas restrictions may materially affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to various regulations regarding its emission of greenhouse gases in its manufacturing facilities. In addition, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. These requirements could make our products more expensive and reduce demand for our products. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs.\nPotential product, service or other related liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of specialty chemical products and other related services involve inherent exposure to potential product liability claims, service level claims, product recalls and related adverse publicity. Any of these potential product or service risks could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures and affect customer confidence in our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations. Although the Company maintains product and other general liability insurance, there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage would be adequate to cover these potential risks. In addition, the Company may not be able to continue to maintain its existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all, in the event a significant product or service claim arises.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may limit the Company\u2019s ability to compete in its markets.\nQuaker has a limited number of patents and patent applications, including patents issued, applied for, or acquired in the United States and in various foreign countries, some of which may prove to be material to its business. Principal reliance is placed upon Quaker\u2019s proprietary formulae and the application of its skills and experience to meet customer needs. Also, Quaker\u2019s products are identified by trademarks that are registered throughout its marketed area. Despite our efforts to protect such proprietary information through patent and trademark filings, through the use of appropriate trade secret protections and through the inability of certain products to be effectively replicated by others, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies, products, and processes. In addition, the laws and/or judicial systems of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. These potential risks to our proprietary information could subject the Company to increased competition and negative impacts to our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nWe might not be able to timely develop, manufacture and gain market acceptance of new and enhanced products required to maintain or expand our business.\nWe believe that our continued success depends on our ability to continuously develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis, in response to customers\u2019 demands for higher performance process chemicals, coatings, greases and other chemical products. Our competitors may develop new products or enhancements to their products that offer performance, features and lower prices that may render our products less competitive or obsolete and, as a consequence, we may lose business and/or significant market share. The development and commercialization of new products requires significant expenditures over an extended period of time, and some products that we seek to develop may never become profitable. In addition, we may not be able to develop and introduce products incorporating new technologies in a timely manner that will satisfy our customers\u2019 future needs or achieve market acceptance.\nAn inability to appropriately capitalize on Company growth, including prior or future acquisitions, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nQuaker has completed several acquisitions recently and in the past and, also, may continue to seek acquisitions to grow its business in the future. In addition, the Company continues to grow organically through increased end market growth and incremental market share.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s growth depends on its ability to successfully integrate such opportunities, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully execute the integration or consolidation of the acquired or additional business into existing processes and operations;\n\u2022\ndevelop or modify financial reporting, information systems and other related financial tools to ensure overall financial integrity and adequacy of internal control procedures;\n\u2022\nidentify and take advantage of potential cost reduction opportunities, while maintaining legacy business and other related attributes; and\n\u2022\nfurther penetrate existing and new markets with the product capabilities acquired in acquisitions.\nThe Company may fail to derive significant benefits or may not create the appropriate infrastructure to support such additional business, which could have a material adverse effect on liquidity, financial position and results of operations. Also, if the Company fails to achieve sufficient financial performance from an acquisition, certain long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill or other intangible assets, could become impaired and result in the recognition of an impairment loss.\nThe scope of our international operations subjects the Company to risks, including, but not limited to, risks from changes in trade regulations, currency fluctuations, and political and economic instability.\nSince significant revenues and earnings are generated by non-U.S. operations, Quaker\u2019s financial results are affected by currency fluctuations, particularly between the U.S. Dollar and the E.U. Euro, the Brazilian Real, the Chinese Renminbi, and the Indian Rupee, and the impact of those currency fluctuations on the underlying economies. During the past three years, sales by non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 60% to 65% of our annual consolidated net sales. Generally, all of the Company\u2019s operations use the local currency as their functional currency. The Company generally does not use financial instruments that expose it to significant risk involving foreign currency transactions; however, the size of its non-U.S. activities has a significant impact on reported operating results and attendant net assets. Therefore, as exchange rates vary, Quaker\u2019s results can be materially affected. Incorporated by reference is the foreign exchange risk information contained in Item 7A of this Report and the geographic information in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nThe Company often sources inventory among its worldwide operations. This practice can give rise to foreign exchange risk resulting from the varying cost of inventory to the receiving location, as well as from the revaluation of intercompany balances. The Company mitigates this risk through local sourcing efforts.\nAdditional risks associated with the Company\u2019s international operations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions from country to country, similar to past instability in certain European economies;\n\u2022\nchanges in a country\u2019s political condition, such as the current political unrest in the Middle East;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\nlicensing and other legal requirements;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the repatriation of our assets, including cash;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties of staffing and managing dispersed international operations;\n\u2022\nless protective foreign intellectual property laws;\n\u2022\nlegal systems that may be less developed and predictable than those in the United States; and\n\u2022\nlocal tax issues.\nThe breadth of Quaker\u2019s international operations subjects the Company to various local non-income taxes, including value-added-taxes (\u201cVAT\u201d). With VAT and other similar taxes, the Company essentially operates as an agent for various jurisdictions by collecting VAT-related taxes from customers and remitting those amounts to the taxing authorities on the goods it sells. The laws and regulations regarding VAT-related taxes can be complex and vary widely among countries, as well as among individual jurisdictions within a given country, and for the same products, making full compliance difficult. As VAT and other similar taxes are often charged as a percentage of the selling price of the goods sold, the amounts involved can be material. Should there be non-compliance by the Company, it may need to remit funds to the tax authorities prior to collecting the appropriate amounts from the customers or jurisdictions, which may have been incorrectly paid. In addition, the Company may choose for commercial reasons not to seek repayment from certain customers. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations. See Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this Report, which is incorporated herein by this reference, for further discussion.\nDisruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and our customer relationships.\nQuaker relies on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. The Company also relies on its technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with customers and suppliers,\nfulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide support to customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business. Our information technology systems may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber-attacks, any of which, if successful, could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cybersecurity incidents, such as these, are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and there can be no assurance that our protective measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation and financial results. Failure to monitor, maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or, to anticipate, plan for and recover from significant disruptions to these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nTerrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, natural disasters or other uncommon global events may affect the markets in which we operate and our profitability.\nTerrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, natural disasters or other uncommon global events may negatively affect our operations. There can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the U.S. or other locations where we do business. Also, other uncommon global events, such as earthquakes, fires and tsunami, cannot be predicted. Terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or armed conflicts, and natural disasters may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Additional terrorist attacks or natural disasters may disrupt the global insurance and reinsurance industries with the result that we may not be able to obtain insurance at historical terms and levels, if at all, for all of our facilities. Furthermore, any of these events may make travel and the transportation of our supplies and products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect the sales of our products. The consequences of terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or armed conflicts, natural disasters or other uncommon global events can be unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events, such as these, that could have an adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 64929, "SIC": 2990, "TIC": "KWR"}
