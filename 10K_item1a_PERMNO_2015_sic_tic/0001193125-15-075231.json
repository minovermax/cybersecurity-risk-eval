Risk Factors.\nThe risk factors described below discuss potential events, trends, or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, access to capital resources, and, consequently, cause the market value of our common stock to decline. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and expectations of future financial performance. If any of the risks occur and the market price of our common stock declines significantly, individuals may lose all, or part, of their investment in our Company. Individuals should carefully consider our risk factors and the additional information included in, or incorporated by reference to, this report before making an investment decision. There may be risks and uncertainties that we have not identified or that we have deemed immaterial that could adversely affect our business; therefore, the following risk factors are not intended to be an exhaustive list of all risks we face. All forward-looking statements are qualified by the risks described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe current economic environment poses significant challenges.\nFrom December 2007 through June 2009, the U.S. economy faced a severe economic crisis and experienced the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Although the domestic economy continued a modest recovery in 2014, business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the U.S. continues to remain reduced and local governments and many businesses continue to experience financial difficulty. While reflecting some improvement, unemployment levels remain elevated. There can be no assurance that these conditions will continue to improve nor that these conditions will not worsen.\nOur financial performance is generally highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets we operate and the U.S. as a whole, which includes the ability of borrowers to pay interest, repay principal on outstanding loans, the value of collateral securing those loans, and demand for loans and other products and services we offer. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity, investor or business confidence; limitations on the\navailability, or increases, in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nDuring recent years, the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the U.S. and worldwide. Although economic conditions have improved since the recession, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty about continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing, and savings habits. Such\nconditions could adversely affect the credit quality of the Bank\u2019s loans and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly, the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy and interest rates could influence the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings. Further, such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income and earnings could be adversely affected. Conversely, if interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings, our net interest income and earnings could also be adversely affected.\nOur estimated allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nLike all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable loan losses. Our allowance may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and future loan loss provisions could materially and adversely affect our operating results. The appropriate level of the allowance is determined by management and inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, which may undergo material changes. Our allowance is determined by analyzing historical loan losses, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, plans for problem loan resolution, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, and industry information. Management\u2019s estimates also include considerations about the impact of economic events, which are uncertain. Future losses are susceptible to changes in economic, operating, and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which may be beyond our control, and charge-offs may exceed our current estimates. Federal regulatory agencies regularly review our loans and allowance for loan losses as an integral part of the examination process. We believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for probable losses. There is no assurance that we will not, or that regulators will not require us to, increase our allowance in future periods, which could materially and adversely affect our earnings and profitability.\nNon-covered nonperforming assets were $19.92 million as of December 31, 2014, $27.79 million as of December 31, 2013, and $35.69 million as of December 31, 2012. We incurred net charge-offs of $2.89 million in 2014, $10.35 million in 2013, and $6.11 million in 2012. Our allowance for loan losses was $20.23 million as of December 31, 2014, $24.08 million as of December 31, 2013, and $25.77 million as of December 31, 2012. Our provision for loan losses charged to operations was $145 thousand in 2014, $8.21 million in 2013, and $5.68 million in 2012. A provision recovery was realized for purchased credit impaired (\u201cPCI\u201d) loans of $697 thousand in 2014, which included a recovery of $275 thousand included in the provision charged to operations and $422 thousand was recorded through the FDIC indemnification asset. The provision attributed to PCI loans was $747 thousand in 2013, of which $296 thousand was included in the provision charged to operations and $451 thousand was recorded through the FDIC indemnification asset. There was no provision before 2013 for PCI\nloans. As of December 31, 2014, the allowance attributed to non-PCI loans as a percentage of non-covered nonperforming loans was 151.85% and the allowance attributed to non-PCI loans as a percentage of total non-covered loans was 1.29%. If nonperforming assets or net charge-offs increase in future periods, we may be required to increase our allowance for loan losses, which could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nOur level of credit risk may increase due to our focus on commercial, small business, and middle market customers who may have significant vulnerability to economic conditions.\nCommercial business and real estate loans are generally considered riskier than single family residential loans because larger balances are extended to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Commercial business and real estate loans involve risks because the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loans typically depends on the success of the business\u2019 operations or the properties securing the loans. The majority of our commercial business loans are made to small business or middle market customers. Commercial business and real estate loans made or acquired in recent years may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. As of December 31, 2014, our commercial business loans totaled $87.40 million, or 5.17% of our total loan portfolio, and our commercial real estate loans totaled $769.61 million, or 45.55% of our total loan portfolio. As of the same date, our largest outstanding commercial business loan was $7.00 million and largest outstanding commercial real estate loan was $11.32 million.\nIn addition to commercial business and real estate loans, we hold a portfolio of commercial construction loans. Construction loans generally have a higher risk of loss primarily due to the critical nature of certain assumptions and estimates used to value the initial property value upon completion of construction compared to the estimated costs, including interest. If estimates prove inaccurate, final property values may fall below related loan amounts. As of December 31, 2014, our commercial construction loans totaled $54.37 million, or 3.22% of our total loan portfolio. As of the same date, our largest outstanding commercial construction loan was $6.70 million.\nWe may suffer losses in our loan portfolio despite our underwriting practices.\nWe seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices. These practices include the analysis of borrowers\u2019 prior credit histories, financial statements, tax returns, and cash flow projections; valuation of collateral based on independent appraisers\u2019 reports; and verification of liquid assets. We believe our underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various loan types we offer; however, losses may occur that exceed the reserves established in our allowance for loan losses.\nChanges in the fair value of our investment securities may reduce stockholders\u2019 equity and net income.\nChanges in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of the related tax effect, impact stockholders\u2019 equity through AOCI. The unrealized gain or loss represents the difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost of the securities. A decline in the estimated fair value of the portfolio results in a decline in stockholders\u2019 equity, book value per common share, and tangible book value per common share. The decrease is recorded even though the securities are not sold or held for sale. If a debt security is never sold and no credit impairment exists, the decrease is recovered at the security\u2019s maturity. Equity securities have no stated maturity; therefore, declines in fair value may or may not be recovered over time. As of December 31, 2014, the fair value of securities available for sale was $326.12 million and the aggregate unrealized losses on those securities were $12.26 million.\nWe conduct quarterly reviews of our securities portfolio to determine if the declines are other-than-temporary. We consider the following factors in our analysis of debt securities: our intent to sell the securities, the evidence available to determine if it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the securities before recovery of the amortized cost, and the probable credit losses. Probable credit losses are evaluated using the present value of future cash flows; the severity and duration of the decline in fair value below amortized cost; the financial\ncondition and near-term prospects of the issuer; whether the decline is related to issuer conditions, general market, or industry conditions; the payment structure; the failure to make scheduled interest or principal payments; and changes to the securities\u2019 rating by rating agencies. Decreases in the fair value of debt securities caused by changes in interest rates are generally considered temporary, which is consistent with our experience. If we determine that fair value decreases are other-than-temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged to earnings as a component of noninterest income. We recognized other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) charges of $705 thousand in our debt securities portfolio in 2014.\nFactors we consider in our analysis of equity securities include: our intent to sell the security before recovery of the cost; the severity and duration of the decline in fair value below cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and whether the decline appears to be related to issuer conditions, general market, or industry conditions. We recognized OTTI charges of $32 thousand in our equity securities portfolio in 2014.\nWe continue to monitor the fair value of our securities portfolio as part of our ongoing OTTI evaluation process. No assurance can be given that we will not need to recognize OTTI charges in the future. Additional OTTI charges may materially affect our financial condition and earnings.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, possible enforcement, and other legal action.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state governmental authorities, laws, and judicial and administrative decisions that impose requirements and restrictions on our operations. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole, not stockholders. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations, and regulatory policies, including changes in the interpretation or implementation, may cause substantial and unpredictable effects, require additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products offered, or allow non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes. Failure to follow laws, regulations, and policies may result in sanctions by regulatory agencies and civil money penalties, which could have material adverse effects on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have policies and procedures designed to prevent violations; however, there is no assurance that violations will not occur. Existing and future laws, regulations, and policies yet to be adopted may make compliance more difficult or expensive; restrict our ability to originate, broker, or sell loans; further limit or restrict commissions, interest, and other charges earned on loans we originate or sell; and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations, to the extent such dividends are required, that may affect the Company\u2019s ability to pay expenses and dividends to shareholders.\nThe Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank. The Company depends on its other subsidiaries\u2019 and the Bank\u2019s cash, liquidity, and payment of dividends to the Company to pay operating expenses and dividends to stockholders. There is no assurance that the Bank will have the capacity to pay dividends to the Company in the future or that the Company will not require dividends from the Bank to satisfy obligations. The Bank\u2019s dividend payment is governed by various statutes and regulations. Depending on factors such as the Bank\u2019s financial condition, the FRB of Richmond or the Virginia Bureau, the Bank\u2019s primary regulators, may deem dividends or other payments an unsafe or unsound practice. The Company may not be able to service obligations as they become due if the Bank is unable to pay dividends sufficient to satisfy the Company\u2019s obligations, including required payments to the Trust or dividends on our Series A Noncumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) or our common stock. Consequently, the inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects.\nWe face strong competition from other financial institutions, financial service companies, and organizations that offer services similar to our offerings.\nWe primarily conduct our operations in Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. We may be unsuccessful against current and future competitors in regions that offer products and services similar to those we offer; therefore, increased competition may result in reduced loan originations and deposits. Our competitors include savings associations, national banks, regional banks, and community banks. We also face competition from finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks, and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include state and national banks and major financial companies with resources that may provide a marketplace advantage by expanding and maintaining numerous banking locations and mounting extensive promotional and advertising campaigns.\nFinancial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have higher lending limits that enable them to serve the credit needs of larger clients and, to the extent they are more diversified than us, may be able to offer the same products and services at more competitive rates and prices. If we are unable to attract and retain banking clients, our loan and deposit growth, general business, financial condition, and prospects may be negatively affected.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value.\nWe may seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar, have experienced management, and possess either significant market presence or the potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale, or expanded services. Risks inherent in acquiring other banks, businesses, and banking branches may include the following:\n\u2022\npotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n\u2022\nexposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;\n\u2022\ndifficulty, expense, and delays of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company;\n\u2022\npotential disruption to our business;\n\u2022\npotential diversion of management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\nloss of key employees and customers of the target company;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in estimating the value of the target company;\n\u2022\npotential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company;\n\u2022\nunexpected costs and delays;\n\u2022\nthe target company\u2019s performance does not meet our growth and profitability expectations;\n\u2022\nlimited experience in new markets or product areas;\n\u2022\nincreased time, expenses, and personnel as a result of strain on our infrastructure, staff, internal controls, and management; and\n\u2022\npotential short-term decreases in profitability.\nWe regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving the payment of cash or the issuance of debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions\ntypically involve goodwill, a purchase premium over the acquired company\u2019s book and market values; therefore, dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur. If we are unable to realize revenue increases, cost savings, geographic or product presence growth, or other projected benefits from acquisitions; our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may engage in FDIC-assisted transactions.\nWe may acquire assets and liabilities of failed financial institutions that are in FDIC receivership. FDIC-assisted acquisitions include risks inherent in acquiring other banks, businesses, and banking branches, as well as risks specific to each transaction. FDIC-assisted acquisitions generally provide limited diligence and term negotiation and may require additional resources, expenses, and time to service acquired loans, including PCI loans, integrate personnel and operating systems, and establish processes to service acquired assets. Acquisitions may also require us to raise additional capital that could have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders. If we are unable to manage these risks, FDIC-assisted acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to receive benefits under FDIC loss share agreements is subject to compliance with certain requirements, oversight and interpretation, and contractual term limitations.\nWe receive benefits under loss share agreements in connection with the FDIC-assisted acquisition of Waccamaw Bank (\u201cWaccamaw\u201d) in June 2012. Under these loss share agreements, the FDIC agreed to cover 80% of most loans and foreclosed real estate losses. Loans covered under the agreements represented 7.24% of our total loans held for investment as of December 31, 2014, compared to 13.21% as of June 30, 2012. We are subject to certain obligations under the agreements that prescribe and specify how to manage, service, report, and request reimbursement for losses incurred on covered assets. Our obligations under the loss share agreements are extensive, and failure to follow any obligations could result in a specific asset, or group of assets, losing loss share coverage. Reimbursement requests are subject to FDIC review and may be delayed or disallowed if we do not comply with our obligations. Losses projected to occur during the loss share term may not be realized until after the expiration of the applicable agreement; consequently, those losses may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Our current loss estimates only include those projected to occur during the loss share period we expect reimbursement from the FDIC at the applicable reimbursement rate. We are subject to FDIC audits to ensure compliance with the loss share agreements. The loss share agreements are subject to interpretation by the FDIC and us; therefore, disagreements about the coverage of losses, expenses, and contingencies may arise.\nOur accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models.\nThe processes we use to estimate probable loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depends upon analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models we use for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models used for determining probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models we use to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon the sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe repeal of the federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase our interest expense.\nAll federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act beginning on July 21, 2011. As a result, some financial institutions have commenced offering interest on demand deposits to compete for customers. We do not yet know what interest rates other institutions may offer as market interest rates begin to increase. Our interest expense will increase and net interest margin will decrease if we begin offering interest on demand deposits to attract additional customers or maintain current customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available in the future.\nWe expect banking and financial companies, many with significantly greater resources, to compete for the acquisition of financial services businesses. This competition could increase the price of potential acquisitions that we believe are attractive. If we fail to receive proper regulatory approval, we will not be able to consummate an acquisition. Our regulators consider our capital, liquidity, profitability, regulatory compliance, level of goodwill and intangible assets, and other factors when considering acquisition and expansion proposals. Future acquisitions may be dilutive to our earnings and equity per share of our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock.\nOur goodwill may be determined to be impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our carrying balance of goodwill was $100.72 million. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more often if necessary, using quantitative and qualitative factors. When available, quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for measuring impairment. Other acceptable valuation methods include present value measurements based on multiples of earnings, revenues, or similar performance measures. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, goodwill is determined to be impaired. Impairment charges may cause an adverse effect on our earnings and financial position. We recognized no goodwill impairment in 2014.\nWe may lose members of our management team and have difficulty attracting skilled personnel.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people can be intense. The unexpected loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business due to the loss of certain skills, market knowledge, and industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. Certain existing and proposed regulatory guidance on compensation may also negatively affect our ability to retain and attract skilled personnel.\nWe may be required to pay higher FDIC insurance premiums or special assessments.\nOur deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC\u2019s DIF and we are subject to deposit insurance premiums and assessments to maintain deposit insurance. We are unable to predict future insurance assessment rates; however, deterioration in our risk-based capital ratios or adjustments to base assessment rates may result in higher insurance premiums or special assessments. The deterioration of banking and economic conditions and financial institution failures deplete the FDIC\u2019s DIF and reduce the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. If the DIF is unable to meet funding requirements, increases in deposit insurance premium rates or special assessments may also be required. Future assessments, increases, or required prepayments related to FDIC insurance premiums may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may require additional capital in the future that may not be available when needed.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to strengthen our capital position, increase our liquidity, satisfy obligations, or pursue growth objectives. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on current conditions in capital markets, which are outside our control, and our financial performance. Certain economic conditions and declining market confidence may increase our cost of funds and limit our access to customary sources of capital, such as borrowings with other financial institutions, repurchase agreements, and availability under the FRB\u2019s discount window. Events that limit access to capital markets and the inability to obtain capital may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and market value of common stock. We cannot provide any assurance that additional capital will be available, on acceptable terms or at all, in the future.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations.\nLiquidity is essential to our business and the inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, equity and debt offerings, or other sources could have a materially adverse effect on our liquidity. Company specific factors such as a decline in our credit rating, an increase in the cost of capital from financial capital markets, a decrease in business activity due to adverse regulatory action or other company specific event, or a decrease in depositor or investor confidence may impair our access to funding with acceptable terms adequate to finance our activities. General factors related to the financial services industry such as a severe disruption in financial markets, a decrease in industry expectations, or a decrease in business activity due to political or environmental events may impair our access to liquidity.\nWe are subject to credit risk associated with the financial condition of other financial institutions.\nFinancial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, investment companies, and other institutional clients. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the failure, actions, and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. These transactions may expose us to credit risk if our counterparty or client defaults on their contractual obligation. Our credit risk may increase if the collateral we hold cannot be realized or liquidated at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. In the event of default, we may be required to provide collateral to secure the obligation to the counterparties. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving one of such counterparties, we may experience delays in recovering the assets posted as collateral or may incur a loss to the extent that the counterparty was holding collateral in excess of the obligation to such counterparty. Losses from routine funding transactions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. In the ordinary course of business, we foreclose on and take title to properties that secure certain loans. Hazardous or toxic substances could be found on properties we own. If substances are present, we may be liable for remediation costs, personal injury claims, and property damage and our ability to use or sell the property would be limited. We have policies and procedures in place that require environmental reviews before initiating foreclosure actions on real property; however, these reviews may not detect all potential environmental hazards. Environmental laws that require us to incur substantial remediation costs, which could materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value, and other liabilities associated with environmental hazards could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nWe review our internal controls over financial reporting quarterly and enhance controls in response to these assessments, internal and external audit, and regulatory recommendations. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, include certain assumptions and can only provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These controls may be circumvented by individual acts, collusion, or management override. Any failure or circumvention related to our controls and procedures or failure to follow regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe continue to encounter technological change.\nThe financial services industry continues to experience rapid technological change with the introduction of new, and increasingly complex, technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases operational efficiency that enables financial service institutions to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to provide products and services that satisfactorily meet the financial needs of our customers, as well as to realize additional efficiencies in our operations. We may fail to use technology-driven products and services effectively to better serve our customers and increase operational efficiency or sufficiently invest in technology solutions and upgrades to ensure systems are operating properly. Further, many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technology, which may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe are subject to information security risks associated with technology.\nWe rely on communication and information systems, including those provided by third-party vendors, to conduct our business operations. Our security risks increase as our reliance on technology increases; consequently, the expectation to safeguard information by monitoring systems for potential failures, disruptions, and breakdowns has also increased. Risks associated with technology include security breaches, operational failures and service interruptions, and reputational damages. These risks also apply to our third-party service providers. Our third-party vendors include large entities with significant market presence in their respective fields; therefore, their services could be difficult to replace quickly if there are operational failures or service interruptions.\nWe rely on our technology-driven systems to conduct daily business and accounting operations that include the collection, processing, and retention of confidential financial and client information. We may be vulnerable to security breaches, such as employee error, cyber-attacks, and viruses, beyond our control. In addition to security breaches, programming errors, vandalism, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and third-party vendor disruptions may cause operational failures and service interruptions to our communication and information systems. Further, our systems may be temporarily disrupted during implementation or upgrade. Security breaches and service interruptions related to our information systems could damage our reputation, which may cause us to lose customers, subject us to regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and financial liability.\nWe periodically review our information security policies, procedures, disaster recovery plans, and financial condition of third-party vendors; however, there is no assurance that security risks will not occur, or if they do occur that our processes and procedures are implemented properly to accurately address such risks. Security risks, including those of third-party vendors, could affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, cause us to incur significant expense, or damage our reputation, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims and litigation pertaining to intellectual property.\nBanking and other financial services companies, such as the Company, rely on technology companies to provide information technology products and services necessary to support the Company\u2019s day-to-day operations. Technology companies often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations\nof intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. Competitors of the Company\u2019s vendors, or other individuals or companies, have from time to time claimed to hold intellectual property sold to the Company by its vendors. Such claims may increase in the future as the financial services sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors. The plaintiffs in these actions often seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. Such litigation is often expensive, time consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations, and distracting to management. If the Company is found to infringe upon one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third party. In certain cases, the Company may consider entering into licensing agreements for disputed intellectual property, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Company\u2019s operating expenses. If legal matters related to intellectual property claims were resolved against the Company or settled, the Company could be required to make payments in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly affect our business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. These events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in a loss of revenue, and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for our stockholders to resell their common stock when desired. The following factors, among others, may cause our common stock price to fluctuate significantly:\n\u2022\nactual or expected variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nrecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of comparable companies, as deemed by investors;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns, and other issues in the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace about our Company or competitors;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by, or involving, our Company or competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to integrate acquisitions or realize expected benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations; and\n\u2022\ngeopolitical conditions, such as acts or threats of terrorism or military action.\nGeneral market fluctuations; industry factors; political conditions; and general economic conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns, recessions, interest rate changes, or credit loss trends, could also cause our common stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nThe trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ, the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other, larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity, and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions, over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe may not continue to pay dividends on our common stock in the future.\nOur common stockholders are only entitled to receive dividends when declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so, and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a financial holding company, the Company\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\nOur common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund, or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, holders of our common stock could lose some, or all, of their investment.\nCertain banking laws may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult to be acquired by a third party, even if perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock carries a 6% dividend rate. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into 69 shares of our common stock at any time and mandatorily converts on May 20, 2016. At our option, we may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at face value. The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to shares of our common stock. As a result, we make dividend payments on our Series A Preferred Stock before our common stock, and in the event of bankruptcy, dissolution, or liquidation, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will be satisfied before distributions are made to holders of our common stock. If we do not remain current in the payment of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, dividends may not be paid on our common stock. Dividends declared on the Series A Preferred Stock reduce any net income available to our common stockholders and earnings per common share. As of December 31, 2014, 15,151 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding.", "PERMNO": 88944, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FCBC"}
