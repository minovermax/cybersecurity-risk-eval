Risk Factors.\nAs indicated in this Annual Report under the caption \"Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" certain information contained in this Annual Report consists of forward-looking\nstatements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report include the following:\nWorldwide adverse economic conditions negatively impact our business.\nOver the past few years, financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have experienced extreme disruption, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. We have been impacted by these economic developments in that they continue to adversely affect the ability of our clients and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, and have reduced orders for our products and services. These economic conditions will continue to negatively impact us to the extent our clients defer purchasing decisions, thereby lengthening our sales cycles. In addition, our clients' may have constrained budgets affecting their ability to purchase our products at the same level. Our clients' ability to pay for our products and services may also be impaired, which may lead to an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the U.S. Should these economic conditions result in us not meeting our revenue objectives, our operating results, financial condition and stock price could be adversely affected.\nCompetition could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues or profitability.\nThe enterprise-class IT services and solutions market is rapidly evolving and is highly competitive. As technologies change rapidly, we expect that competition will increase in the future. Current economic conditions also place pressure on our competitors to lower their prices and seek opportunities of size and scale different than in the past. We compete with independent IT services and solutions suppliers in the mid to large enterprise market and numerous value-added resellers, distributors and consultants. We also compete in the IT services and solutions market with computer platform suppliers. Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, purchasing and other resources than we do. As a result, they may respond more quickly to changes in economic conditions and client requirements and to new or emerging technologies, devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products and deliver competitive products at lower end-user prices.\nOur suppliers are often our competitors. We are not the exclusive reseller of any IT solutions product we offer. Instead, our suppliers market their products through other independent IT solution providers, OEMs, and through their own internal sales forces. We believe direct competition from our suppliers is likely to increase if, as expected, the IT solutions and services industries continue to consolidate and also converge with providers of IT services and solutions technologies. This consolidation would likely result in fewer suppliers with greater resources to devote to internal sales and marketing efforts. In addition, our suppliers have established and will probably continue to establish cooperative relationships with other suppliers and other IT solutions and services providers. These cooperative relationships are often intended to enable our suppliers to offer comprehensive IT solutions and services, which compete with those we offer. If our relationships with our suppliers become adversarial, we could lose the preferred provider status we maintain with certain suppliers. If that were to occur, it would be more difficult for us to stay ahead of industry developments and provide our clients with the type of service and wide range of technology choices they expect from us.\nMost of our clients already employ in-house technical staffs. To the extent a client's in-house technical staff develops sophisticated server, storage and networking systems expertise, the client may be less likely to seek our services. Further, we compete with IT service providers who manage, store and backup their clients' data at off-site, networked data storage locations.\nMergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could weaken our competitive position, which could harm our operating results.\nOur industry is highly fragmented, and we believe it is likely that our existing competitors will continue to consolidate or will be acquired. In addition, some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting firms or other parties. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could lead to pricing pressure and our loss of market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is dependent on the trend toward outsourcing data center infrastructure-related services.\nOur business and growth depend in large part on the industry trend toward outsourced data center infrastructure-related services. Outsourcing means that an entity contracts with a third party, such as us, to provide IT infrastructure-related services such as consulting, implementation, management and support. There can be no assurance that this trend will continue, as organizations may elect to perform such services themselves. A significant change in this trend could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, there can be no assurance that our cross-selling efforts will cause clients to purchase additional services from us or adopt a single-source outsourcing approach.\nOur financial results would suffer if the market for IT services and solutions does not continue to grow.\nOur services and solutions are designed to address the growing markets for data center consolidation and virtualization services (including private cloud computing), data center implementation services (including storage and data protection services and the implementation of virtualization solutions), and managed services (including operational support and client support). These markets are still evolving. A reduction in the demand for our services and solutions could be caused by, among other things, lack of client acceptance, weakening economic conditions, competing technologies and services or reductions in corporate spending. Our future financial results would suffer if the market for our IT services and solutions does not continue to grow.\nWith continued market demand for greater IT efficiency, scalability, and flexibility, we have been increasingly developing and marketing virtual data center and private cloud computing infrastructures and services. If businesses do not find our virtual data center and private cloud computing solutions compelling, our revenue growth and operating margins may decline.\nOur IT optimization portfolio is based on the virtualization of storage, computing, and network platforms within on-premises data centers. Our success depends on organizations and clients perceiving technological and operational benefits and cost savings associated with services-oriented, virtual data center and private cloud computing-based infrastructures. Although the use of virtualization technologies on servers has become broadly accepted for enterprise-level applications, the extent to which organizations will adopt virtualization across the data center and migrate to private cloud computing remains uncertain. Accordingly, as the market for our virtual data center and private cloud computing infrastructures matures and the scale of our business increases, the rate of growth in our infrastructure and services sales could be lower than those we have experienced in earlier periods. In addition, to the extent that our newer private cloud computing infrastructure solutions and services are adopted more slowly or less comprehensively than we expect, our revenue growth rates may slow materially or our revenue may decline substantially.\nIf we cannot successfully execute on our strategy to market and deliver new services and solutions, our revenue and gross margin may suffer.\nOur long-term strategy is focused on meeting increased client demand for integrated IT solutions and services by leveraging the portfolio of products we offer from leading manufacturers with our own highly customized and innovative services. Our product margins are subject to pricing pressure from our suppliers. In recent years, competition for market share has resulted in increased pricing pressure from these suppliers, reducing the overall profitability of the products we sell. In addition, changes in our product mix, such as the increase in lower-margin networking sales that we have seen in recent years versus higher-margin storage sales, put further pressure on our margins. To offset this decline in product margins, we added or enhanced many of our consulting services offerings in a major investment designed to provide a revenue and profit stream that is not affected by product sales or fulfillment. To successfully execute on this strategy, we need to continue to invest, sell, deliver and expand our services portfolio. Any failure to successfully execute this strategy, including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas, could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial results.\nOur acquisition strategy poses substantial risks.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we made two acquisitions in 2009, one acquisition in October 2011, one acquisition in October 2012, one acquisition in October 2014 and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions in the future. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or, if suitable candidates are identified, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially acceptable terms. We may need to raise additional equity to consummate future acquisitions, which may not be feasible, may be on terms we do not consider favorable, would cause dilution to existing investors and could adversely affect our stock price. We also could incur substantial indebtedness in connection with an acquisition, which could decrease the value of our equity. The process of exploring and pursuing acquisition opportunities requires significant management and financial resources, which diverts attention from our core operations.\nIntegration of acquisitions is very challenging and we cannot assure you that any acquisition will increase our revenues, earnings or stock price. Even if we are able to consummate an acquisition, such as our recent acquisitions, the transaction may present many risks. These risks include, among others: failing to achieve anticipated synergies and revenue increases; difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines; coordinating, establishing or expanding sales, distribution and marketing functions, as necessary; disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management's attention to transition or integration issues; unanticipated and unknown liabilities; the loss of key employees, clients, partners and channel partners of our company or of the acquired company; and difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls, policies and procedures over the systems, products and processes of the acquired company. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by our management and financial or industry analysts or if others do not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do, there could be a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.\nOur continued growth could strain our personnel and financial resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we will not be able to implement our business plan successfully.\nDue to our recent acquisitions and continued organic growth, we have experienced a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations. To the extent that we are unable to sustain such growth, it will place a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage\nthis growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. If our new hires perform poorly or do not achieve expected or forecasted utilization rates, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our future profitability and our business would be harmed. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. The headcount we are adding will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan.\nOur ability to recognize revenue can be adversely affected by product availability.\nWe sell complex enterprise-class IT solutions and services, which include installation and configuration services. We generally recognize revenues from our sale of hardware and software products when shipment has been completed. We rely on our vendors to supply the hardware and software products we sell. We cannot control the availability and shipment of these products. Delays due to component availability, natural disasters and other unforeseen events can prevent us from recognizing revenue on products we ship and may adversely affect our quarterly reported revenues. As a result, our stock price may decline.\nOur key vendors could change or discontinue their incentive programs, which could adversely affect our business.\nSeveral of our key vendors have offered incentive programs to us over the past several years based on our achievement of particular sales levels of their products and early pay discounts. In addition, they have offered margin enhancement programs which provide enhanced discounts for particular products or new client orders. These programs contributed to our profitability in 2015, 2014, and 2013. We cannot assure that these programs will continue or that the sales quotas for our participation will not increase, adversely affecting our ability to take advantage of the incentives. If for any reason, we cannot obtain the same benefits from incentive programs as in the past, it may significantly impact our profitability in the future.\nOur data center services and web site may be subject to intentional disruption.\nWe may be affected by software viruses or similar technology in the future, which could compromise our operations. Further, the systems that we interface with, including the Internet and related systems, may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, hackers, improper employee or contractor access, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems, resulting in the potential misappropriation of our proprietary information or interruptions of our services. Any compromise of our security, whether as a result of our own systems or systems that they interface with, could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our reputation and reduce demand for our services.\nOur failure to protect the integrity and security of our clients' information and access to our clients' information systems could expose us to litigation, materially damage our reputation and harm our business, and the costs of preventing such a failure could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, processing and storage of our clients' confidential information. This sometimes requires us to receive direct access to our clients' information systems. We cannot be certain that our efforts to protect this confidential information and access will be successful. If any compromise of this information security were to occur, or if we fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach, we could be subject to legal claims and government action, experience an adverse effect on our reputation and need to incur significant additional costs to protect against similar information security breaches in the future, each of which could adversely\nimpact our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, because of the critical nature of data security, any perceived breach of our security measures could cause existing or potential clients not to use our solutions and could harm our reputation.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our revenues from large projects.\nWe intend to continue to seek out large projects, which means that we expect that a material percentage of our revenues will come from a small number of clients, with the composition of our key clients likely to change from year to year. Failure to sign a sufficient number of large projects in a period can impact our revenues and profitability for that period. Current economic conditions likely will continue to adversely affect the number of and size of large projects available for us. If we fail to obtain a growing number of large projects each year, our revenues and profitability will likely be adversely affected. In addition, our reliance on large projects makes it more likely that our revenues and profits will fluctuate unpredictably from quarter to quarter and year to year. Unpredictable revenue and profit fluctuations may make our stock price more volatile and lead to a decline in our stock price.\nOur business depends on our ability to hire and retain technical personnel and highly qualified sales people.\nOur future operating results depend upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified engineers and sales people with enterprise-class data storage, server and networking solutions experience. If we fail to recruit and retain additional engineering and sales personnel, or if losses require us in the future to terminate employment of some of these personnel, we will experience greater difficulty realizing our business strategy, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and stock price.\nWe generally do not have employment agreements with our employees.\nOur future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our executive officers, managers, salespeople, engineers and other technical personnel, many of whom have substantial experience in our industry and would be difficult to replace. Except for our President and Chief Executive Officer, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, Chief Operating Officer, and Executive Vice President, Human Resources, we do not have employment agreements with our employees. Accordingly, our employees may voluntarily leave us at any time and work for our competitors. Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to retain our current employees and hire new employees. Any failure to retain our key employees will make it much more difficult for us to maintain our operations and attain our growth objectives and could therefore be expected to adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and stock price.\nOur long sales cycle may cause fluctuating operating results, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur sales cycle is typically long and unpredictable, making it difficult to plan our business. Current economic conditions increase this uncertainty. Our long sales cycle requires us to invest resources in potential projects that may not occur. In addition, our long and unpredictable sales cycle may cause us to experience significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results. It can also result in delayed revenues, difficulty in matching revenues with expenses and increased expenditures. Our business, operating results or financial condition and stock price may suffer as a result of any of these factors.\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional funds, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity financing, our security holders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the value of shares of our common stock could decline. If we engage in debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u2022 continue to expand our technology development, sales and marketing organizations;\n\u2022 hire, train and retain employees; or\n\u2022 respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.\nOur inability to do any of the foregoing could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf the IT solutions industries fail to develop compelling new technologies, our business may suffer.\nRapid and complex technological change, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards increase demand for our services. Because of this, our future success depends in part on the IT solutions industry's ability to continue to develop leading-edge IT solutions. Our clients utilize our services in part because they know that newer technologies offer them significant benefits over the older technologies they are using. If the IT solutions industry ceases to develop compelling IT solutions, or if a single IT solutions standard becomes widely accepted and implemented, it will be more difficult to sell new IT solutions to our clients. The continued tightened budgets among established IT solutions manufacturers and the difficulty of raising new capital for innovative start-up companies under current economic conditions may also stifle development of new IT solutions technologies.\nWe operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks.\nAs a result of our acquisition of Bear Data in October 2014, we now have operations in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Kingdom in addition to the United States and we are seeking to further expand our international operations. As of December 31, 2015, we had sold products into 55 countries. Our international revenues comprised 5.7%, 1.4% and 1.0% of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The future growth and profitability of our international business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Many of the following factors have adversely affected our international operations and sales to clients located outside of the United States and may again in the future:\n\u2022 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, particularly in new geographic locations;\n\u2022 challenges in providing solutions across a significant distance, in different languages and among different cultures;\n\u2022 rapid changes in government, economic and political policies and conditions, political or civil unrest or instability, terrorism or epidemics, and other similar outbreaks or events;\n\u2022 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022 compliance with and changes in foreign laws and regulations, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including those associated with export controls, tariffs and embargoes, other trade restrictions and antitrust and data privacy concerns;\n\u2022 seasonal reductions in business activity in certain parts of the world, particularly during the summer months in Europe;\n\u2022 higher costs of doing business internationally;\n\u2022 protectionist laws and business practices that favor local producers and service providers;\n\u2022 taxation;\n\u2022 restrictions imposed by local labor practices and laws on our business and operations;\n\u2022 workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022 transportation delays; and\n\u2022 increased payment risk and higher levels of payment fraud.\nA deterioration of global, regional or local political, economic or social conditions could affect potential clients in ways that reduce demand for our solutions and services, disrupt our sales plans and efforts or otherwise negatively impact our business. Acts of terrorism, wars, public health issues and increased energy costs could disrupt commerce in ways that could impair our ability to provide solutions and services to our clients and increase the cost of doing business. We have not undertaken hedging transactions to cover our foreign currency exposure, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively impact reported revenue and expenses. In addition, a deterioration of political, economic or social conditions in a given country or region could reduce or eliminate our ability to collect accounts receivable in that country or region. In any of these events, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nConditions in foreign countries and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may significantly reduce our reported results of operations.\nWe have operations globally. In 2015, approximately 6% of our sales were generated by entities operating outside of the United States. Fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction and translation losses, which can materially and adversely impact our results of operations, as well as our revenue and net income expressed on a U.S. dollar basis. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy and we currently engage in very limited foreign currency translation hedging and risk management activities. If we continue to engage in these efforts in the future, there is no assurance we would be effective at properly mitigating risk at a reasonable cost.\nControl by our existing shareholders could discourage the potential acquisition of our business.\nCurrently, our executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately 11.4% of our outstanding common stock. Acting together, these insiders may be able to significantly impact the election of our Board of Directors and may have a significant impact on the outcome of all other matters requiring shareholder approval. This voting concentration may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our management or otherwise discourage potential acquirers from attempting to gain control of us. If potential acquirers are deterred, you may lose an opportunity to profit from a possible acquisition premium in our stock price.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, and, especially in light of current stock market and worldwide economic conditions, may continue to be volatile. We cannot assure you\nthat our stock price will increase, or even that it will not decline significantly from the price you pay. Our stock price may be adversely affected by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, including those resulting from changes in accounting rules;\n\u2022 general market conditions, including the effects of current economic conditions;\n\u2022 announcements of technical innovations;\n\u2022 new products or services offered by us, our suppliers or our competitors;\n\u2022 changes in estimates by securities analysts of our future financial performance;\n\u2022 our compliance with SEC and NASDAQ rules and regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022 the timing of stock sales under 10b5-1 plans or otherwise; and\n\u2022 war and terrorism threats.\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate in the future, which could result in volatility in our stock price.\nOur quarterly revenues and results of operations have varied in the past and may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including the success of our new offerings. If our quarterly revenues or results of operations fluctuate, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below and identified throughout this \"Risk Factors\" section:\n\u2022 our ability to retain and increase sales to clients and attract new clients;\n\u2022 the timing and success of introductions of new solutions or upgrades by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 the strength of the economy;\n\u2022 changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022 competition, including entry into the industry by new competitors and new offerings by existing competitors;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of our expenses, including stock-based compensation and expenditures related to expanding our operations, supporting new clients or introducing new solutions; and\n\u2022 changes in the payment terms for our solutions.\nWe do not intend to declare dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and, therefore, do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Therefore, you should not expect to receive dividend income from shares of our common stock.\nOur governing documents and Minnesota law may discourage the potential acquisitions of our business.\nOur Board of Directors may issue additional shares of capital stock and establish their rights, preferences and classes, in some cases without shareholder approval. In addition, we are subject to\nanti-takeover provisions of Minnesota law. These provisions may deter or discourage takeover attempts and other changes in control of us without approval from our Board of Directors. If potential acquirers are deterred, you may lose an opportunity to profit from a possible acquisition premium in our stock price.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions to date, and a significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire in the future may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. We may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may constitute a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 87160, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "DTLK"}
