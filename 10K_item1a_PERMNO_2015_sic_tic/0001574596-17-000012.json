{"cik": "1574596", "company": "New Home Co Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, which address the material risks concerning our business, together with the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks discussed in this annual report on Form 10-K occur, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, in which case the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly and you could lose part or all of your investment. Some statements in this annual report, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the initial section of this annual report entitled \u201cCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur geographic concentration could materially and adversely affect us if the homebuilding industry or the availability of land parcels in our current markets declines.\nOur current business involves the design, construction and sale of innovative single-family detached and attached homes in planned communities in major metropolitan areas in coastal Southern California, the San Francisco Bay area, metro Sacramento and the greater Phoenix area. Because our operations are concentrated in these areas, a prolonged economic downturn affecting one or more of these areas, or affecting any sector of employment on which the residents of such area are dependent, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and a disproportionately greater impact on us than other homebuilders with more diversified operations. During the downturn from 2008 to 2011, land values, the demand for new homes and home prices declined substantially in California. In addition, the state of California recently experienced severe budget shortfalls and has raised taxes and increased building permits and development fees to offset the deficit. Accordingly, our sales, results of operations, financial condition and business could be negatively impacted by a decline in the economy, one or more significant job sectors or the homebuilding industry in the Western U.S. regions in which our operations are concentrated.\nIn addition, our ability to acquire land parcels for new single-family homes may be adversely affected by changes in the general availability of land parcels, the willingness of land sellers to sell land parcels at reasonable prices, competition for available land parcels, availability of financing to acquire land parcels, zoning and other market conditions. The availability of land parcels in our California markets at reasonable prices is limited. If the supply of land parcels appropriate for development of single-family homes is limited because of these factors, or for any other reason, our ability to grow could be significantly limited, and the number of homes that we build and sell could decline.\nThe homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in general economic, real estate and other business conditions that could reduce the demand for new homes and, as a result, adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in general economic, real estate and other business conditions such as levels of employment, consumer confidence and income, availability of mortgage financing for homebuyers, interest rate levels, demographic trends, homebuyer preferences for specific designs or locations, real estate taxes, inflation and supply of and demand for new and existing homes. The foregoing conditions, among others, are complex and interrelated. Periods of prolonged economic downturn, high unemployment levels, increases in the rate of inflation and uncertainty in the U.S. economy, have contributed to decreased demand for housing, declining sales prices and increasing pricing pressure. In the event that one or more of such economic and business conditions occur, we could experience declines in the market value of our inventory and demand for our homes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse economic conditions outside the U.S., such as Asia or Canada, may also adversely affect the demand for our homes to the extent such conditions impact the amount of potential homebuyers from such regions in our markets.\nIn addition, an important segment of our customer base consists of first and second \u201cmove-up\u201d buyers, who often purchase homes contingent upon the sale of their existing homes. During recessionary periods, these buyers may face difficulties selling their homes, which may in turn adversely affect our sales. Moreover, during such periods, we may need to reduce our sales prices and offer greater incentives to buyers to compete for sales that may result in reduced margins.\nOur long-term growth depends upon our ability to successfully identify and acquire desirable land parcels for residential buildout for reasonable prices.\nOur future growth depends upon our ability to successfully identify and acquire attractive land parcels for development of our single-family homes at reasonable prices and with terms that meet our underwriting criteria. Our ability to acquire land parcels for new single-family homes may be adversely affected by changes in the general availability of land parcels, the willingness of land sellers to sell land parcels at reasonable prices, competition for available land parcels, availability of financing to acquire land parcels, zoning and other market conditions. We currently depend primarily on the California markets and availability of land parcels in that market at reasonable prices is limited. If the supply of land parcels appropriate for development of single-family homes is limited because of these factors, or for any other reason, our ability to grow could be significantly limited, and the number of homes that we build and sell could decline. Additionally, our ability to begin new projects could be impacted if we elect not to purchase land parcels under option contracts. To the extent that we are unable to purchase land parcels timely or enter into new contracts for the purchase of land parcels at reasonable prices, our home sales revenue and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nLabor and raw material shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of home construction, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe residential construction industry experiences serious labor and raw material shortages from time to time, including shortages in qualified tradespeople, and supplies of insulation, drywall, cement, steel and lumber. These labor and raw material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing or during periods where the regions in which we operate experience natural disasters that have a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures. The cost of labor and raw materials may also increase during periods of shortage or high inflation. During the downturn in 2008 to 2011, a large number of qualified trade partners went out of business or otherwise exited the market into new fields. According to the National Association of Homebuilders, as of September 2016, there were approximately 200,000 unfilled construction jobs in the United States, up 81% in the last two years. A reduction in available trade partners exacerbates labor shortages as demand for new housing increases. Shortages and price increases could cause delays in and increase our costs of home construction, which we may not be able to recover by raising home prices due to market demand and because the price for each home is typically set months prior to its delivery pursuant to the agreement of sale with the home buyer, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations depend on the availability and skill of subcontractors.\nSubstantially all of our construction work is done by third-party subcontractors with us acting as the general contractor. Accordingly, the timing and quality of our construction depend on the availability and skill of our subcontractors. We do not have long-term contractual commitments with any subcontractors, and there can be no assurance that skilled subcontractors will continue to be available at reasonable rates and in the areas in which we conduct our operations. Certain of the subcontractors engaged by us are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining arrangements that require the payment of prevailing wages that are higher than normally expected on a residential construction site. A strike or other work stoppage involving any of our subcontractors could also make it difficult for us to retain subcontractors for our construction work. In addition, union activity could result in higher costs to retain our subcontractors. The inability to contract with skilled subcontractors at reasonable costs on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, despite our quality control efforts, we may discover that our subcontractors were engaging in improper construction practices or installing defective materials in our homes. When we discover these issues, we, generally through our subcontractors, repair the homes in accordance with our new home warranty and as required by law. Reserves are established based on market practices, our historical experiences and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built. However, the cost of satisfying our warranty and other legal obligations in these instances may be significantly higher than our reserves, and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from such subcontractors. Regardless of the steps we take, we can in some instances be subject to fines, litigation, or other penalties, and our reputation and our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf the market value of our land or housing inventory decreases, our results of operations could be adversely affected due to the illiquid nature of real estate investments and by impairments.\nThe market value of our land and housing inventories depends on market conditions. We acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets. There is an inherent risk that\nthe value of the land owned or controlled by us may decline after purchase. The risks inherent in purchasing and developing land parcels increase as consumer demand for housing decreases. As a result, we may buy and develop land parcels on which homes cannot be profitably built and sold. The valuation of property is inherently subjective and based on the individual characteristics of each property. When market conditions drive land values down, land we have purchased or option agreements we have previously entered into may become less desirable because we may not be able to build and sell homes profitably, at which time we may elect to sell the land or, in the case of options contracts, to forego pre-acquisition costs and deposits and terminate the agreements. Factors such as changes in regulatory requirements and applicable laws (including in relation to building regulations, taxation and planning), political conditions, the condition of financial markets, both local and national economic conditions, the financial condition of customers, potentially adverse tax consequences, and interest and inflation rate fluctuations subject the market value of land owned, controlled or optioned by us to uncertainty. Moreover, all valuations are made on the basis of assumptions that may not prove to reflect economic or demographic reality. If housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory, our results of operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build houses. Land parcels, building lots and housing inventories are illiquid assets, and we may not be able to dispose of them efficiently or at all if we or the housing market and general economy are in financial distress. In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market. We regularly review the value of our land holdings and continue to review our holdings on a periodic basis. Material impairments in the value of our inventory may be required, and we may in the future sell land or homes at significantly lower margins or at a loss, if we are able to sell them at all, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively against competitors in the homebuilding industry.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other homebuilders in each market in which we operate. Additionally, there are relatively low barriers to entry into our business. We compete with numerous large national and regional homebuilding companies and with smaller local homebuilders and land developers for, among other things, home buyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled management and labor resources. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct homes that are superior or substantially similar to our products. Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion and cause us to increase our selling incentives or reduce our prices. An oversupply of homes available for sale and the heavy discounting of home prices by some of our competitors have adversely affected demand for homes in the market as a whole and could do so again in the future. We also compete with the resale, or \u201cpreviously owned,\u201d home market. If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business could decline disproportionately to our competitors, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may be at a competitive disadvantage with regard to certain of our large national and regional homebuilding competitors whose operations are more geographically diversified than ours, as these competitors may be better able to withstand any future regional downturn in the housing market. We compete directly with a number of large national and regional homebuilders that may have longer operating histories and greater financial and operational resources than we do. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors, local governments and suppliers in the markets in which we operate or in which we may operate in the future. This may give our competitors an advantage in securing materials and labor at lower prices, marketing their products and allowing their homes to be delivered to customers more quickly and at more favorable prices. This competition could reduce our market share and limit our ability to expand our business as we have planned.\nIf we are unable to develop our communities successfully or within expected timeframes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBefore a community generates any revenue, time and material expenditures are required to acquire land, obtain development approvals and construct significant portions of project infrastructure, amenities, model homes and sales facilities. It can take several years from the time we acquire control of a property to the time we make our first home sale on the site. Delays in the development of communities expose us to the risk of changes in market conditions for homes. A decline in our ability to develop and market our communities successfully and to generate positive cash flow from these operations in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and on our ability to service our debt and to meet our working capital requirements.\nIncreases in our cancellation rate could have a negative impact on our home sales revenue and homebuilding margins.\nIn connection with the sale of a home we collect a deposit from the homebuyer that is a small percentage of the total purchase price. Upon a home order cancellation, the homebuyer\u2019s escrow deposit is returned to the homebuyer (other than with respect to certain design-related deposits, which we retain). Home order cancellations can result from a number of factors, including declines or slow appreciation in the market value of homes, increases in the supply of homes available to be purchased, increased competition, higher mortgage interest rates, and changes in homebuyers' financial condition or personal circumstances. Home order cancellations negatively impact our financial and operating results due to a negative impact on the number of homes closed, net new home orders, home sales revenue and results of operations, as well as the number of homes in backlog.\nA large proportion of our fee building revenue is from one customer.\nThe Company\u2019s fee building revenues have historically been concentrated with a small number of customers. We have several fee building agreements with Irvine Pacific, LP and our billings to this customer are dependent upon such customer\u2019s decision to proceed with construction and the agreements can be canceled at any time. We cannot predict whether these agreements will continue in the future or the current pace of construction, and the loss of these billings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Fee Building\" and Note 1 \"Revenue Recognition - Fee Building\" to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of this revenue concentration.\nWe are subject to product liability and warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business.\nAs a homebuilder, we are subject to construction defect, product liability and home warranty claims, arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. While we maintain general liability insurance and generally seek to require our subcontractors and design professionals to indemnify us for some portion of the liabilities arising from their work, there can be no assurance that these insurance rights and indemnities will be collectible or adequate to cover any or all construction defect and warranty claims for which we may be liable. We may not be able to renew our insurance coverage or renew it at reasonable rates and may incur significant costs or expenses (including repair costs and litigation expenses) surrounding possible construction defects, soil subsidence or building related claims. Some claims may arise out of uninsurable events or circumstances not covered by insurance not subject to effective indemnification agreements with our trade partners.\nIn addition, we conduct all of our business in California, one of the most highly regulated and litigious jurisdictions in the United States, which imposes a ten year, strict liability tail on many construction liability claims. As a result, our potential losses and expenses due to litigation, new laws and regulations may be greater than those of our competitors who have smaller California operations.\nAdverse weather and geological conditions may increase costs, cause project delays and reduce consumer demand for housing, all of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nAs a homebuilder and land developer, we are subject to the risks associated with numerous weather-related and geologic events, many of which are beyond our control. These weather-related and geologic events include but are not limited to droughts, floods, wildfires, landslides, soil subsidence and earthquakes. The occurrence of any of these events could damage our land parcels and projects, cause delays in the completion of our projects, reduce consumer demand for housing and cause shortages and price increases in labor or raw materials, any of which could harm our sales and profitability. Our California markets are in areas which have historically experienced significant earthquake activity and seasonal wildfires. In addition to directly damaging our land or projects, earthquakes, floods, landslides, wildfires or other geologic events could damage roads and highways providing access to those projects, thereby adversely affecting our ability to market homes in those areas and possibly increasing the costs of completion.\nThere are some risks of loss for which we may be unable to purchase insurance coverage. For example, losses associated with landslides, earthquakes and other geologic events may not be insurable, and other losses, such as those arising from terrorism, may not be economically insurable. A sizeable uninsured loss could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of the seasonal nature of our business, our quarterly operating results fluctuate.\nAs discussed under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Seasonality\u201d we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements that can have a material impact on our results and our consolidated financial statements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in spring and summer, although this activity also highly depends on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings and other market factors. Since it typically takes four to ten months to construct a new home, we deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders convert to home deliveries. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occur during the second half of the year. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry. We expect the traditional seasonality cycle and its impact on our results to become more prominent if and as the present housing recovery progresses and the homebuilding industry returns to a more normal operating environment, but we can make no assurances as to the degree to which our historical seasonal patterns will occur in 2017 and beyond, if at all.\nWe may be unable to obtain suitable bonding for the development of our housing projects.\nWe are often required to provide bonds to governmental authorities and others to ensure the completion of our projects. As a result of market conditions, surety providers have been reluctant to issue new bonds and some providers are requesting credit enhancements (such as cash deposits or letters of credit) in order to maintain existing bonds or to issue new bonds. If we are unable to obtain required bonds in the future for our projects, or if we are required to provide credit enhancements with respect to our current or future bonds, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nInflation could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nInflation could adversely affect us by increasing the costs of land, raw materials and labor needed to operate our business. If our markets have an oversupply of homes relative to demand, we may be unable to offset any such increases in costs with corresponding higher sales prices for our homes. Inflation typically also accompanies higher interests rates, which could adversely impact potential customers\u2019 ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, thereby further decreasing demand. If we are unable to raise the prices of our homes to offset the increasing costs of our operations, our margins could decrease. Furthermore, if we need to lower the price of our homes to meet demand, the value of our land inventory may decrease. Inflation may also raise our costs of capital and decrease our purchasing power, making it more difficult to maintain sufficient funds to operate our business.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage.\nBuilding sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the homebuilding industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks to those working at such sites. Due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of projects we work on, health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements or litigation, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation, our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies, governmental authorities and local communities, and our ability to win new business, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative publicity or poor relations with the residents of our communities could negatively impact sales, which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline.\nUnfavorable media related to our industry, company, brands, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance, or prospects may affect our stock price and the performance of our business, regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy. Our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment. Adverse publicity or negative commentary on social media outlets, such as blogs, websites or newsletters, could hurt operating results, as consumers might avoid or protest brands that receive bad press or negative reviews. Negative publicity may result in a decrease in our operating results.\nIn addition, residents of communities we develop may look to us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities. Efforts made by us to resolve these issues or disputes could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents, and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect sales or our reputation.\nAn information systems interruption or breach in security could adversely affect us.\nPrivacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved. We rely on accounting, financial and operational management information systems to conduct our operations. Any disruption in these systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Furthermore, as part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including information about employees, vendors and suppliers. This information is entitled to protection under a number of regulatory regimes. We may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business. Our failure to maintain the security of the data which we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in customers confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur a variety of costs to engage in future growth or expansion of our operations or acquisitions of businesses, and the anticipated benefits may never be realized.\nAs a part of our business strategy, we may consider growth or expansion of our operations in our current markets or in other areas of the country. For example, in 2016 we expanded or operations to the Phoenix metro area. Any such growth or expansion would be accompanied by risks such as:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies or businesses;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired companies or business;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\nour potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful expansion or acquisition;\n\u2022\nimpairment of existing relationships with employees, contractors, suppliers and customers as a result of the integration of new management personnel and cost-saving initiatives; and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience.\nThe magnitude, timing and nature of any future acquisition or expansion will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to identify suitable additional markets or acquisition candidates. We cannot guarantee that any expansion into a new market will be successfully executed, and our failure to do so could harm our current business.\nWater shortages or price increases could adversely impact our operations.\nCertain of the areas in which we operate, particularly in Southern California and Northern California, have experienced significant increases in water costs due to drought. In addition, our communities in these locations are susceptible to government regulations and laws that restrict our water usage or increase our costs. These restrictions and costs may significantly restrict our business activities and cause us to incur significant liabilities and operating expenses. In addition, water restrictions, drought conditions and rate increases may adversely affect the local economies in which we operate, which may reduce demand for housing in our markets.\nA reduction in our sales absorption levels may force us to incur and absorb additional community-level costs.\nWe incur certain overhead costs associated with our communities, such as indirect construction costs, marketing expenses and costs associated with the upkeep and maintenance of our model and sales complexes. If our sales absorptions pace decreases and the time required to close out our communities is extended, we would likely incur additional overhead costs, which would negatively impact our financial results. Additionally, we incur various land development improvement costs for a community prior to the commencement of home construction. Such costs include infrastructure, utilities, taxes and other related expenses. Reduction in home absorption rates increases the associated holding costs and extends our time to recover such costs. Declines in the homebuilding market may also require us to evaluate the recoverability of costs relating to land acquired more recently.\nFuture terrorist attacks against the United States or increased domestic or international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nFuture terrorist attacks against the United States or any foreign country or increased domestic or international instability could cause consumer unease, which could significantly reduce the number of new contracts signed, increase the number of cancellations of existing contracts, and/or increase our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nMortgage financing, interest rate increases or changes in federal lending programs or other regulations could lower demand for or impact homebuyers\u2019 ability to purchase our homes, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nSubstantially all purchasers of our homes finance their acquisitions with mortgage financing. Rising interest rates, decreased availability of mortgage financing or of certain mortgage programs, higher down payment requirements, increased monthly mortgage costs, tightened credit requirements and underwriting standards, and an increase in indemnity claims for mortgages may lead to reduced demand for our homes and mortgage loans. Deterioration in credit quality among subprime and other nonconforming loans has caused most lenders to eliminate subprime mortgages and most other loan products that do not conform to Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, Federal Housing Administration, or FHA, or Veterans Administration, or the VA, standards. In addition, as a result of the turbulence in the credit markets and mortgage finance industry during the last downturn, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law. This legislation provides for a number of new requirements relating to residential mortgages and mortgage lending practices that reduce the availability of loans to borrowers or increase the costs to borrowers to obtain such loans. Fewer loan products and tighter loan qualifications, in turn, make it more difficult for a borrower to finance the purchase of a new home or the purchase of an existing home from a potential \u201cmove-up\u201d buyer who wishes to purchase one of our homes. The foregoing may also hinder our ability to realize our backlog because our home purchase contracts provide customers with a financing contingency. Financing contingencies allow customers to cancel their home purchase contracts in the event that they cannot arrange for adequate financing. As a result, rising interest rates, stricter underwriting standards, and a reduction of loan products, among other similar factors, can decrease our home sales. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe federal government has also taken on a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgage-backed securities originated by mortgage lenders, and its insurance of mortgages originated by lenders through the FHA and the VA. The availability and affordability of mortgage loans, including interest rates for such loans, could be adversely affected by a curtailment or cessation of the federal government\u2019s mortgage-related programs or policies. The FHA may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards, raise minimum down payment requirements, impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs, or limit the number of mortgages it insures. Due to federal budget deficits, the U.S. Treasury may not be able to continue supporting the mortgage-related activities of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FHA and the VA at present levels, or it may revise significantly the federal government\u2019s participation in and support of the residential mortgage market. Because the availability of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA and VA-backed mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing and selling many of our homes, any limitations, restrictions or changes in the availability of such government-backed financing could reduce our home sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws can increase the after tax cost of owning a home, and further tax law changes or government fees could adversely affect demand for the homes we build or increase our costs.\nUnder current tax law certain significant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage loan interest costs and real estate taxes, generally are deductible expenses for the purpose of calculating an individual\u2019s federal, and in some cases state, tax liability. However, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law in January 2013, resulted in higher income tax rates and limits the amount of mortgage interest individuals can deduct in computing their income tax liability. The limit on deductibility of mortgage interest can increase the after-tax cost of owning a home for some individuals.\nAny additional increases in personal income tax rates and/or additional tax deduction limits could adversely impact demand for new homes, including homes we build, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees, such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools, open space, and road improvements, and/or provide low- and moderate-income housing, could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our\noperations. In addition, increases in local real estate taxes could adversely affect our potential home buyers, who may consider those costs in determining whether to make a new home purchase and decide, as a result, not to purchase one of our homes.\nNew and existing laws and regulations or other governmental actions may increase our expenses, limit the number of homes that we can build or delay the completion of our projects.\nWe are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, which can limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or \u201cslow-growth\u201d or \u201cno-growth\u201d initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees, assessments and exactions for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development. As a result, home sales could decline and costs could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which may increase our costs, limit the areas in which we can build homes and delay completion of our projects.\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given property vary according to multiple factors, including the property\u2019s location, its environmental conditions and geographic attributes, the present and former uses of the property, the presence or absence of endangered plants or animals or sensitive habitats, as well as conditions at nearby properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. For example, under certain environmental laws and regulations, third parties, such as environmental groups or neighborhood associations, may challenge the permits and other approvals required for our projects and operations. Any such claims may adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance coverage for such claims may be limited or non-existent.\nIn addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved and agency rulemaking and litigation are ongoing, the outcome of such rulemaking and litigation can be unpredictable, and at any time can result in unplanned or unforeseeable restrictions on or even the prohibition of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. From time to time, the EPA and similar federal, state or local agencies review land developers\u2019 and homebuilders\u2019 compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws, including those applicable to control or storm water discharges during construction, or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs and result in project delays. We expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on land developers and homebuilders in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber, and on other building materials.\nCalifornia is especially susceptible to restrictive government regulations and environmental laws. For example, California imposes notification obligations respecting environmental conditions, sometimes recorded on deeds, and also those required to be delivered to persons accessing property or to home buyers or renters, which may cause some persons, or their financing sources, to view the subject parcels as less valuable or as impaired. California has also enacted so-called \u201cclimate change\u201d legislation, which could result in additional costs to achieve energy use or energy efficiency mandates, alter community layouts, meet \u201cgreen building\u201d standards and impose carbon or other greenhouse gas reductions or offset obligations, and could result in other costs or obligations as well.\nUnder various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including for bodily injury, and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. A mitigation system may be installed during the construction of a home if a cleanup does not remove all contaminants of concern or to address a naturally occurring condition such as methane. Some buyers may not want to purchase a home with a mitigation system. Many of the agreements pursuant to which we purchase land for development provide that we purchase the land \u201cas is\u201d and that the seller of the land makes no representation as to the existence of any environmental contaminants. Accordingly, we have to rely on our own investigation as\nto the existence of environmental contaminants, and we may not be able to identify all pre-existing environmental contaminants at the time we purchase the land.\nLegislation relating to energy and climate change could increase our costs to construct homes.\nThere is a variety of new legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment at the federal, state and local level relating to energy and climate change. This legislation relates to items such as carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our cost to construct homes. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and become more costly to comply with. Similarly, energy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world and because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, they could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap and trade and similar energy-related regulations.\nRisks Related to Financing and Indebtedness\nDifficulty in obtaining sufficient capital could prevent us from acquiring land for our developments or increase costs and delays in the completion of our development projects.\nThe homebuilding and land development industry is capital-intensive and requires significant up-front expenditures to acquire land parcels and complete development. We cannot assure you that we will maintain cash reserves and generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount to enable us to service our debt or to fund other liquidity needs. Additionally, while we have a $260 million unsecured revolving credit facility designed to provide us with a source of liquidity, our ability and capacity to borrow under the facility is limited by our ability to meet the covenants of the facility. If our credit facility and internally generated funds are insufficient to cover our liquidity needs, we may seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources, including additional bank financings, formation of joint venture relationships or securities offerings. The availability of borrowed funds, especially for land acquisition and construction financing, may be greatly reduced nationally, and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans. If we are required to seek additional financing to fund our operations, continued volatility in these markets may restrict our flexibility to access such financing. If we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned capital and other expenditures, we may be unable to acquire land for our housing developments or to develop the land and construct homes. Additionally, if we cannot obtain additional financing to fund the purchase of land under our option contracts or purchase contracts, we may incur contractual penalties and fees. Any difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital for planned development expenditures could also cause project delays, which could increase our costs. Furthermore, if additional funds are raised through the issuance of stock, dilution to stockholders could result. If additional funds are raised through the incurrence of debt, we will incur increased debt servicing costs and may become subject to additional restrictive financial and other covenants. We can give no assurance as to the terms or availability of additional capital. If we are not successful in obtaining or refinancing capital when needed, it could adversely impact our ability to operate our business effectively, which could reduce our sales and earnings, and adversely impact our financial position.\nOur level of indebtedness may adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.\nDue to the capital-intensive nature of the homebuilding business, we incur substantial indebtedness to finance our homebuilding activities. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $260.0 million in loan commitments, of which $118.0 million was outstanding. There can be no assurance we would be able to obtain such additional capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIncurring substantial debt could subject us to many risks that, if realized, would adversely affect us, including the risk that:\n\u2022\nour cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal of and interest on the debt, which is likely to result in acceleration of the maturity of such debt;\n\u2022\nour debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions with no assurance that investment yields will increase with higher financing costs;\n\u2022\nwe would be required to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for other purposes such as land and lot acquisition, development and construction activities; and\n\u2022\nwe may be put at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing conditions in our industry, including increased competition.\nWe expect to pay our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness with cash flow from operations or from existing working capital. Our ability to meet our expenses depends, to a large extent, on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets or borrow additional funds. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced to dispose of our assets on disadvantageous terms, potentially resulting in losses. To the extent we cannot meet any future debt service obligations, we may lose some or all of our assets that may be pledged to secure our obligations to foreclosure. Also, debt agreements may contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances. Defaults under our debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently have significant amounts invested in unconsolidated joint ventures with independent third parties in which we have less than a controlling interest. These investments are highly illiquid and have significant risks due to, in part, a lack of sole decision-making authority and reliance on the financial condition and liquidity of our joint venture partners.\nWe own interests in various joint ventures and as of December 31, 2016, our investments in and advances to our unconsolidated joint ventures was $50.9 million. We have entered into joint ventures in order to acquire attractive land positions, to manage our risk profile and to leverage our capital base. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future, thereby reducing the amount of capital required by us to make investments and diversifying our capital sources for growth. Such joint venture investments involve risks not otherwise present in wholly owned projects, including the following:\n\u2022\nControl and Partner Dispute Risk. We do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, management and other aspects of the project or joint venture, which may prevent us from taking actions that are in our best interest but opposed by our partners. We cannot exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the project or joint venture, which could create the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, such as acquisitions or sales. Disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business and could result in subjecting the projects owned by the joint venture to additional risk. Our existing joint venture agreements contain, and any future joint venture agreements may contain, buy-sell provisions pursuant to which one partner may initiate procedures requiring the other partner to choose between buying the other partner\u2019s interest or selling its interest to that partner; we may not have the capital to purchase our joint venture parties\u2019 interest under these circumstances even if we believe it would be beneficial to do so.\n\u2022\nCovenant Compliance Risk. Our Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility prohibits us from making investments in and advances to joint ventures when we are unable to meet certain financial covenants, including the adjusted leverage ratio. If we become unable to fund our joint venture obligations this could result in, among other things, defaults under our joint venture operating agreements, loan agreements, and credit enhancements. And, our failure to satisfy our joint venture obligations could also affect our joint venture's ability to carry out its operations or strategy which could impair the value of our investment in the joint venture.\n\u2022\nDevelopment Risk. Typically, we serve as the administrative member, managing member, or general partner of our joint ventures and one of our subsidiaries acts as the general contractor while our joint venture partner serves as the capital provider. Due to our respective role in these joint ventures, we may become liable for obligations beyond our proportionate equity share. In addition, the projects we build through joint ventures are often larger and have a longer time horizon than the typical project developed by our wholly owned homebuilding operations. Time delays associated with obtaining entitlements, unforeseen development issues, unanticipated labor and material cost increases, higher carrying costs, and general market deterioration and other changes are more likely to impact larger, long-term projects, all of which may negatively impact the profitability of these ventures and our proportionate share of income.\n\u2022\nFinancing Risk. There are generally a limited number of sources willing to provide acquisition, development and construction financing to land development and homebuilding joint ventures. During difficult market conditions, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain financing for our joint ventures on commercially reasonable terms, or to refinance existing joint venture borrowings as such borrowings mature. In addition, a partner may fail to fund its share of required capital contributions or may become bankrupt, which generally would cause us and any other remaining partners to remain liable for the joint venture\u2019s liabilities, As a result, we may be required to contribute our corporate\nfunds to the joint venture to finance acquisition and development and/or construction costs following termination or step-down of joint venture financing that the joint venture is unable to restructure, extend, or refinance with another third party lender. In addition, our ability to contribute our funds to or for the joint venture may be limited if we do not meet the credit facility conditions discussed above.\n\u2022\nContribution Risk. Under credit enhancements that we typically provide with respect to joint venture borrowings, we and our partners could be required to make additional unanticipated investments in and advances to these joint ventures, either in the form of capital contributions or loan repayments, to reduce such outstanding borrowings. We may have to make additional contributions that exceed our proportional share of capital if our partners fail to contribute any or all of their share. While in most instances we would be able to exercise remedies available under the applicable joint venture documentation if a partner fails to contribute its proportional share of capital, our partner's financial condition may preclude any meaningful cash recovery on the obligation. See Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\u201d and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on LTV maintenance agreements and completion guaranties.\n\u2022\nCompletion Risk. We often sign a completion agreement in connection with obtaining financing for our joint ventures. Under such agreements, we may be compelled to complete a project even if we no longer have an economic interest in the joint venture or the joint venture no longer has an interest in the property.\n\u2022\nIlliquid Investment Risk. We lack a controlling interest in our joint ventures and therefore are generally unable to compel our joint ventures to sell assets, return invested capital, require additional capital contributions or take any other action without the vote of at least one or more of our venture partners. This means that, absent partner agreement, we may not be able to liquidate our joint venture investments to generate cash.\n\u2022\nConsolidation Risk. The accounting rules for joint ventures are complex and the decision as to whether it is proper to consolidate a joint venture onto our balance sheet is fact intensive. If the facts concerning an unconsolidated joint venture were to change and a triggering event under applicable accounting rules were to occur, we might be required to consolidate previously unconsolidated joint ventures onto our balance sheet which could adversely impact our leverage and other financial conditions or covenants.\nAny of the above might subject a project to liabilities in excess of those contemplated and adversely affect the value of our current and future joint venture investments.\nOur current financing arrangements contain, and our future financing arrangements likely will contain, restrictive covenants relating to our operations.\nOur current financing arrangements contain, and the financing arrangements we enter into in the future likely will contain, covenants (financial and otherwise) affecting our ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments or acquisitions, reduce liquidity below certain levels, make distributions to our stockholders, deviate from our core business and operating policies. If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants in our debt agreements, we would be in default under these agreements, which could result in a cross-default under other debt agreements, and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable, terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their respective interests against existing collateral. A default also could limit significantly our financing alternatives, which could cause us to curtail our investment activities or dispose of assets when we otherwise would not choose to do so. A default on any of our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest expense on debt we incur may limit our cash available to fund our growth strategies.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $260.0 million in loan commitments, of which $118.0 million was outstanding. As part of our financing strategy, we may incur a significant amount of additional debt. Our current debt has, and any additional debt we subsequently incur may have, a floating rate of interest. In addition, we may incur fixed rate debt in the future which may be at a higher interest rate than our floating rate debt. Higher interest rates could increase debt service requirements on our current floating rate debt and on any floating or fixed rate debt we subsequently incur, and could reduce funds available for operations, future business opportunities or other purposes. If we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to refinance our then-existing debt on unfavorable terms or liquidate one or more of our assets to repay such debt at times which may not permit realization of a favorable return on such assets and could result in a loss. The occurrence of either such event or both could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nWe have a limited operating history and we may not be able to successfully operate our business.\nOur company was founded in August 2009, and through the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred losses. In connection with our initial public offering, TNHC LLC was converted from a Delaware limited liability company into a Delaware corporation and renamed The New Home Company Inc. Given our limited operating history, you have limited historical information upon which to evaluate our prospects, including our ability to acquire desirable land parcels, develop such land and market our homes. In addition, we cannot assure you that our past experience will be sufficient to enable us to operate our business successfully or implement our operating policies and business strategies as described in this annual report on Form 10-K and in other public statements and filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Furthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows to pay our operating expenses or service our indebtedness. You should not rely upon the past performance of our management team, as past performance may not be indicative of our future results.\nWe are and will continue to be dependent on key personnel and certain members of our management team.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of certain key personnel including, but not limited to, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer each of whom would be difficult to replace. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers, there is no guarantee that these executives will remain employed with us. If any of our key personnel were to cease employment with us, our operating results could suffer. Our ability to retain our key personnel or to attract suitable replacements should any members of our management team leave depends on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key personnel or a limitation in their availability could materially and adversely impact our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. We have not obtained key person life insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of death or disability of any of our key personnel.\nOur charter, bylaws, stockholders' rights agreement and debt covenants could prevent a third party from acquiring us or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\nProvisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with the term of one class expiring each year, which could delay a change in our control. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors to issue new series of common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval. Depending on the rights and terms of any new series created, and the reaction of the market to the series, rights of existing stockholders could be negatively affected. For example, subject to applicable law, our Board of Directors could create a series of common stock or preferred stock with preferential rights to dividends or assets upon liquidation, or with superior voting rights to our existing common stock. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue these new series of common stock and preferred stock could also prevent or delay a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits Delaware corporations from engaging in business combinations specified in the statute with an interested stockholder, as defined in the statute, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person first becomes an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in advance by a majority of the independent directors or by the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding disinterested shares. The application of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes Oxley Act, requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and generally requires in the same report a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, under the recently enacted JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an \"emerging growth company.\" We could be an \"emerging growth company\" until the end of our 2019 fiscal year. The\nrules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.\nWe may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any necessary improvements and receiving an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting in connection with the attestation provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. If we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our internal controls, investors could lose confidence in our financial information and the price of our common stock could decline.\nAs we transition from our status as \u201can emerging growth company,\u201d we may need to upgrade our systems or create new systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, create or outsource an internal audit function, and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. The identification of a material weakness could indicate a lack of controls adequate to generate accurate financial statements that, in turn, could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. Likewise, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies and no requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, although a variety of circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our Common Stock is subject to volatility and our trading volume is relatively low.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Compared to other public homebuilders, we believe we have relatively low trading volume. Because of this limited trading volume, purchases and sales of large numbers of our shares may cause rapid price swings in our stock. In addition, our financial performance, government regulatory action, tax laws, additions or departures of key personnel, interest rates and market conditions in general could have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish, or cease publishing, research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by whether industry or securities analysts publish research and reports about us, our business, our market or our competitors and, if any analysts do publish such reports, what they publish in those reports. Any analysts who do cover us may make adverse recommendations regarding our common stock, adversely change their recommendations from time to time or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors. If any analyst who cover us now or may cover us in the future were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business and, therefore, do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in any financing instruments, applicable legal requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, stockholders may need to sell their shares of our common stock to realize a return on investment, and may not be able to sell shares at or above the price paid for them.\nCertain stockholders have rights to cause our Company to undertake securities offerings. Future sales of our common stock or other securities convertible into our common stock could cause the market value of our common stock to decline and could result in dilution of your shares.\nOur board of directors is authorized, without stockholder approval, to cause us to issue additional shares of our common stock or to raise capital through the issuance of preferred stock, securities (including debt securities) convertible into common stock, options, warrants and other rights, on terms and for consideration as our board of directors in its sole discretion may determine. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly. We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our common stock, or other securities on the value of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by a large stockholder or otherwise, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe entered into a registration rights agreement with the members of TNHC LLC, including the members of our management team and the institutional investors in TNHC LLC, with respect to the shares of our common stock that they received as part of our formation transactions. We refer to these shares collectively as the \u201cregistrable shares.\u201d Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, we have granted the members of TNHC LLC and their direct and indirect transferees shelf registration rights requiring us to file a shelf registration statement and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement so as to allow sales thereunder from time to time, demand registration rights to have the registrable shares registered for resale, and, in certain circumstances, the right to \u201cpiggy-back\u201d the registrable shares in registration statements we might file in connection with any future public offering.\nFuture offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our bankruptcy or liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities that may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by conducting offerings of debt securities or additional offerings of equity securities. Upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments or both that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control. As a result, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings, and purchasers of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their ownership interest in our company.", "PERMNO": 14400, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "NWHM"}
