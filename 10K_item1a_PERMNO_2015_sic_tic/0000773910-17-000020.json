For example, NYMEX West Texas Intermediate oil prices have been volatile and ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel in June 2014 to a low of $26.21 per barrel in February 2016. Also, NYMEX Henry Hub natural-gas prices have been volatile and ranged from a high of $6.15 per MMBtu in February 2014 to a low of $1.64 per MMBtu in March 2016. Our revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital budget, and future growth rates are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas, and NGLs. The markets for oil, natural gas, and NGLs have been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile in the future. Factors influencing the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and worldwide supply of, and demand for, oil, natural gas, and NGLs\n\u2022\nvolatility and trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing, transporting, and marketing oil, natural gas, and NGLs\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural-gas inventories\n\u2022\nweather conditions\n\u2022\nthe level of U.S. exports of oil, liquefied natural gas, or NGLs\n\u2022\nthe ability of the members of OPEC and other producing nations to agree to and maintain production levels\n\u2022\nthe worldwide military and political environment, civil and political unrest worldwide, including in Africa and the Middle East, uncertainty or instability resulting from the escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities, or acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere\n\u2022\nthe effect of worldwide energy conservation and environmental protection efforts\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative and competing fuels\n\u2022\nthe level of foreign imports of oil, natural gas, and NGLs\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental laws, regulations, and taxes\n\u2022\nshareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas in order to minimize emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas (GHG)\n\u2022\nthe proximity to, and capacity of, natural-gas pipelines and other transportation facilities\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions worldwide\nThe long-term effect of these and other factors on the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs is uncertain. Prolonged or substantial declines in these commodity prices may have the following effects on our business:\n\u2022\nadversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures, and results of operations\n\u2022\nreduce the amount of oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we can produce economically\n\u2022\ncause us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects\n\u2022\nreduce our revenues, operating income, or cash flows\n\u2022\nreduce the amounts of our estimated proved oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves\n\u2022\nreduce the carrying value of our oil, natural-gas, and midstream properties due to recognizing additional impairments of proved properties, unproved properties, exploration assets, and midstream facilities\n\u2022\nreduce the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves\n\u2022\nlimit our access to, or increasing the cost of, sources of capital such as equity and long-term debt\n\u2022\nadversely affect the ability of our partners to fund their working interest capital requirements\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations relating to environmental protection that can adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations and properties are subject to numerous international, provincial, federal, regional, state, tribal, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing the release of pollutants or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations govern the following, among other things:\n\u2022\nissuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling, production, and midstream activities\n\u2022\ndrilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas\n\u2022\ntypes, quantities, and concentrations of emissions, discharges, and authorized releases\n\u2022\ngeneration, management, and disposition of waste materials\n\u2022\noffshore oil and natural-gas operations and decommissioning of abandoned facilities\n\u2022\nreclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites\n\u2022\nremediation of contaminated sites\n\u2022\nprotection of endangered species\nThese laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for our failure to comply or for any contamination resulting from our operations, including the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the permitting, development, or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. Moreover, changes in, or reinterpretations of, environmental laws and regulations governing areas where we operate may negatively impact our operations. Examples of recent proposed and final regulations or other regulatory initiatives include the following:\n\u2022\nGround-Level Ozone Standards. In October 2015, the EPA issued a rule under the Clean Air Act, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. The EPA is expected to make final geographical attainment designations and issue final non-attainment area requirements pursuant to this NAAQS rule by late 2017, and any designations or requirements that result in reclassification of areas or imposition of more stringent standards may make it more difficult to construct new or modified sources of air pollution in newly designated non-attainment areas. Moreover, states are expected to implement more stringent regulations, which could apply to our operations. Compliance with this rule could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs.\n\u2022\nReduction of Methane Emissions by the Oil and Gas Industry. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for volatile organic compounds from certain new, modified, and reconstructed oil and natural-gas production and natural-gas processing and transmission facilities. The EPA\u2019s rule is comprised of New Source Performance Standards, known as Subpart Quad OOOOa, that require certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural-gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart Quad OOOOa standards will expand previously issued New Source Performance Standards published by the EPA in 2012, known as Subpart OOOO, by using certain equipment specific emissions control practices with respect to, among other things, hydraulically-fractured oil and natural-gas well completions, fugitive emissions from well sites and compressors, and equipment leaks at natural-gas processing plants and pneumatic pumps. Moreover, in November 2016, the EPA issued a final Information Collection Request seeking information about methane emissions from facilities and operators in the oil and natural-gas industry. The EPA has indicated that it intended to use the information from this request to develop Existing Source Performance Standards for the oil and gas industry. Compliance with this rule could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs.\n\u2022\nInduced Seismic Activity Associated with Oilfield Disposal Wells. We dispose of wastewater generated from oil and natural-gas production operations directly or through the use of third parties. The legal requirements related to the disposal of wastewater in underground injections wells are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to recent seismic events near injection wells used for the disposal of produced water resulting from oil and natural-gas activities. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma issued new rules for wastewater disposal wells in 2014 that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, is developing and implementing plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. The Texas Railroad Commission adopted similar permitting, operating, and reporting rules for disposal wells in 2014. In addition, ongoing class action lawsuits, to which we are not currently a party, allege that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by us or by commercial disposal well vendors whom we may use from time to time to dispose of wastewater, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating costs, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022\nReduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The U.S. Congress and the EPA, in addition to some state and regional efforts, have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislations, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act and may require the installation of \u201cbest available control technology\u201d to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs together with other criteria pollutants. Also, certain of our operations are subject to EPA rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore production sources. In December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that requires member countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. Although this international agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves.\nThese and other regulatory changes could significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs or could result in delays to or limitations on our exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. For a description of certain environmental proceedings in which we are involved, see Legal Proceedings under Item 3 and Note 16-Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural-gas operations could increase our costs of doing business, impose additional operating restrictions or delays, and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations such as shales. We routinely apply hydraulic-fracturing techniques in many of our U.S. onshore oil and natural-gas drilling and completion programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand, and additives under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.\nHydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural-gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have also asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA issued an effluent limit guidelines final rule in June 2016 prohibiting the discharge of return water recovered from shale natural-gas extraction operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) published a final rule in March 2015 that establishes new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands but, in September 2015, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of this rule, finding that the BLM lacked congressional authority to promulgate the rule. That decision is currently being appealed by the federal government. Also, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in the U.S. Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In the event that new federal restrictions on the hydraulic-fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we may incur significant additional costs or permitting requirements to comply with such federal requirements, and could experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities.\nCertain states in which we operate, including Colorado, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Texas, and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, or other regulatory requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations, including subsurface water disposal. For example, in January 2016, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission approved two new rules that require increased collaborative efforts between oil and natural-gas operators and local governments regarding the siting of large-scale oil and natural-gas facilities in certain urban mitigation areas, and require such operators to pursue certain registrations and/or notifications of local governments. States also could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. For example, several cities in Colorado passed temporary or permanent moratoria on hydraulic fracturing within their respective city limits in 2012 to 2013 but, since that time, local district courts struck down the ordinances for certain of those Colorado cities in 2014, which decisions were upheld by the Colorado Supreme Court in May 2016. Notwithstanding attempts at the local level to prohibit hydraulic fracturing, the opportunity exists for cities to adopt local ordinances allowing hydraulic fracturing activities within their jurisdictions while regulating the time, place, and manner of those activities.\nAdditionally, certain interest groups in Colorado opposed to oil and natural-gas development generally, and hydraulic fracturing in particular, have from time to time advanced various options for ballot initiatives that, if approved, would allow revisions to the state constitution in a manner that would make such exploration and production activities in the state more difficult in the future. For example, proponents of such initiatives sought to include on the Colorado November 2016 ballot certain amendments that, if approved, could, among other things, authorize local governmental control over oil and natural-gas development in Colorado that could impose more stringent requirements than currently implemented under state law and impose a 2,500-foot mandatory setback between certain oil and natural-gas development facilities and specified occupied structures and areas of interest. These particular amendments failed to gather enough valid signatures to be placed on the November 2016 ballot. However, Amendment 71 was placed on the Colorado 2016 ballot and approved by voters, making it more difficult to place an initiative to amend the constitution on the state ballot. For an initiative to be placed on the state ballot, Amendment 71 requires signatures from 2% of registered voters from each of the state\u2019s 35 Senate districts and it must be approved by 55% of the voters. In the event that ballot initiatives, local or state restrictions, or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas in areas where we conduct operations, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities. In addition, we could possibly be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. Such compliance costs and delays, curtailments, limitations, or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nIn addition to asserting regulatory authority, a number of federal entities have reviewed various environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources \u201cunder some circumstances,\u201d noting that the following hydraulic fracturing \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits.\nOur debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility.\nOur total debt was $15.3 billion at December 31, 2016. We also have various commitments for leases, drilling contracts, derivative contracts, firm transportation, and purchase obligations for services and products. Our financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise fully realize the value of our assets and opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments\nAdditionally, the credit agreements governing our Five-Year Facility and our 364-Day Facility contain a number of customary covenants, including a financial covenant requiring maintenance of a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65% (excluding the effect of non-cash write-downs), and limitations on certain secured indebtedness, sale-and-leaseback transactions, and mergers and other fundamental changes. Our ability to meet such covenants may be affected by events beyond our control.\nA downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt was rated \u201cBBB\u201d with a stable outlook by S&P and Fitch. Our long-term debt was rated \u201cBa1\u201d with a stable outlook by Moody\u2019s, which is below investment grade. As of the time of filing this Form 10-K, no additional changes in our credit rating have occurred and we are not aware of any current plans of S&P, Fitch, or Moody\u2019s to revise their respective credit ratings on our long-term debt. Any downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of capital and could also adversely affect our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy or to raise debt in the public debt markets.\nAs a result of Moody\u2019s below-investment-grade rating of our long-term debt in February 2016, we became more likely to be required to post collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash as financial assurance of our performance under certain contractual arrangements such as pipeline transportation contracts and oil and gas sales contracts. The amount of letters of credit or cash provided as assurance of our performance under these types of contractual arrangements with respect to credit-risk-related contingent features was $274 million at December 31, 2016, and zero at December 31, 2015. Additionally, certain of these arrangements contain financial assurances language that may, under certain circumstances, permit our counterparties to request additional collateral.\nFurthermore, as a result of Moody\u2019s rating, the credit thresholds with certain derivative counterparties were reduced and in some cases eliminated, which required us to increase the amount of collateral posted with derivative counterparties when our net trading position is a liability in excess of the contractual threshold. No counterparties have requested termination or full settlement of derivative positions. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed was $1.4 billion (net of $117 million of collateral) at December 31, 2016, and $1.3 billion (net of $58 million of collateral) at December 31, 2015. For additional information, see Note 9-Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAdditionally, in February 2016, Moody\u2019s downgraded our commercial paper program credit rating, which eliminated our access to the commercial paper market.\nOur proved reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserves estimates or assumptions underlying our reserves estimates could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control that could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated. The reserves information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K represents estimates prepared by our internal engineers. The procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants; however, no reserves audit was conducted by these consultants. Estimation of reserves is not an exact science. Estimates of economically recoverable oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions, any of which may cause actual results to vary considerably from these estimates. These factors and assumptions may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nestimated future production from an area is consistent with historical production from similar producing areas\n\u2022\nassumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and court rulings\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future oil, natural-gas, and NGLs prices, future operating costs, and capital expenditures\n\u2022\nestimates of future severance and excise taxes, workover costs, and remedial costs\nEstimates of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of expected future net cash flows prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues, and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and the variance may be material. The discounted cash flows included in this Form 10-K should not be construed as the fair value of the estimated oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on the average beginning-of-month prices during the 12-month period for the respective year. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from the SEC regulation-compliant prices used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves. Therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease.\nFailure to replace reserves may negatively affect our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to find, develop, or acquire additional oil and natural-gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced, unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities, acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. We may be unable to find, develop, or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil and natural-gas prices increase, our costs for finding or acquiring additional reserves could also increase.\nOur domestic operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.\nOur domestic operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and are subject to complex provincial, federal, regional, state, tribal, local, and other laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, permitting, changes in taxes, deductions, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering-rate controls, and hydraulic fracturing, induced seismicity, and environmental protection regulations. To the extent our domestic operations are offshore, we must also comply with requirements focused on oil and natural-gas exploration and production activities in coastal and outer continental shelf (OCS) waters. To conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from various provincial, federal, regional, state, tribal, and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. Our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws, including environmental and tax laws and regulations, are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations such as the adoption of government-payment-transparency regulations. In past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and natural-gas companies. Such legislative changes have included, but not been limited to, the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities. The U.S. Congress could consider, and could include, some or all of these proposals as part of tax reform legislation to accompany lower federal income tax rates. Moreover, other more general features of tax-reform legislation, including changes to the rules related to cost recovery and foreign tax credits, and to the deductibility of interest expense, may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and natural-gas companies. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and natural-gas development, or increase costs, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFuture economic, business, or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nDuring the last few years, concerns over inflation, potential default on U.S. debt, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and uncertainties with regard to European sovereign debt, have each contributed at various times to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. Continued concerns could cause demand for petroleum products to diminish or stagnate, which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas, and NGLs and impede the execution of long-term sales agreements or prices thereunder which are the basis for future LNG production; affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers, and customers to continue operations; and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nWe are vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that could negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nWe conduct offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Ghana, Mozambique, Colombia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and other countries. Our operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by conditions in some of these areas and are also vulnerable to certain unique risks associated with operating offshore, including those relating to the following:\n\u2022\nhurricanes and other adverse weather conditions\n\u2022\ngeological complexities and water depths associated with such operations\n\u2022\nlimited number of partners available to participate in projects\n\u2022\noilfield service costs and availability\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental, safety, and other laws and regulations\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks such as piracy\n\u2022\nremediation and other costs and regulatory changes resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials\n\u2022\nfailure of equipment or facilities\n\u2022\nresponse capabilities for personnel, equipment, or environmental incidents\nIn addition, we conduct much of our exploration in deep waters (greater than 1,000 feet) where operations, support services, and decommissioning activities are more difficult and costly than in shallower waters. The deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as international deepwater locations, lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result, deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and the time that we can market our production, thereby increasing the risk involved with these operations.\nAdditional domestic and international deepwater drilling laws, regulations, and other restrictions; delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill-response, and decommissioning plans; and other related developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn recent years, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the BSEE, agencies of the U.S. Department of the Interior, have imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. For example, in 2016, BSEE finalized rule-making entitled Oil and Sulfur Operations on the Outer Continental Shelf - Blowout Prevention Systems and Well Control which focuses on well blowout preventer systems and well control with respect to operations on the OCS. Compliance with these more stringent regulatory requirements and with existing environmental and oil spill regulations, together with any uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits or exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans, and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts.\nIn addition, new regulatory initiatives may be adopted or enforced by the BOEM or the BSEE in the future that could result in additional costs, delays, restrictions, or obligations with respect to oil and natural-gas exploration and production operations conducted offshore. For example, in April 2016, the BOEM published a proposed rule that would update existing air-emissions requirements relating to offshore oil and natural-gas activity on federal OCS waters including in the Central Gulf of Mexico. In addition, in September 2016, the BOEM issued a Notice to Lessees and Operators that would bolster supplemental bonding procedures for the decommissioning of offshore wells, platforms, pipelines, and other facilities. These regulatory actions, or any new rules, regulations, or legal initiatives could delay or disrupt our operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs, and limit activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities or result in the suspension or cancellation of leases. Moreover, under existing BOEM and BSEE rules relating to assignment of offshore leases and other legal interests on the OCS, assignors of such interests may be held jointly and severally liable for decommissioning of OCS facilities existing at the time the assignment was approved by the BOEM, in the event that the assignee is unable or unwilling to conduct required decommissioning. In the event that we, in the role of assignor, receive orders from the BSEE to decommission OCS facilities that one of our assignees of offshore facilities is unwilling or unable to perform, we could incur costs to perform those decommissioning obligations, which costs could be material.\nAlso, if material spill events were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries where such an event were to occur could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws, regulations, or legal initiatives on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover the risks associated with such operations. The overall costs to implement and complete any such spill response activities or any decommissioning obligations could exceed estimated accruals, insurance limits, or supplemental bonding amounts, which could result in the incurrence of additional costs to complete.\nFurther, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (as well as international deepwater locations) lacks the degree of physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. Therefore, despite our oil spill-response capabilities, it may be difficult for us to quickly or effectively execute any contingency plans related to potential material events in the future.\nThe matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe operate in foreign countries and are subject to political, economic, and other uncertainties.\nWe have operations outside the United States, including in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique, Colombia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and other countries. As a result, we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties with respect to our international operations. These risks may include the following, among other things:\n\u2022\nloss of revenue, property, and equipment or delays in operations as a result of hazards such as expropriation, war, piracy, acts of terrorism, insurrection, civil unrest, and other political risks, including tension and confrontations among political parties\n\u2022\ntransparency issues in general and, more specifically, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption compliance laws and issues\n\u2022\nincreases in taxes and governmental royalties\n\u2022\nunilateral renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities\n\u2022\nredefinition of international boundaries or boundary disputes\n\u2022\ndifficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies\n\u2022\nforeign-exchange restrictions\n\u2022\ninternational monetary fluctuations and changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business\nFor example, Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are engaged in a dispute regarding the international maritime boundary between the two countries. As a result, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire claims to be entitled to the maritime area, which covers a portion of the Deepwater Tano Block where the TEN complex is located. In the event C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is successful in its maritime border claims, our operations in Ghana could be materially impacted.\nOutbreaks of civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism have occurred in countries in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, including countries close to or where we conduct operations. Continued or escalated civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism in the countries in which we operate could result in our curtailing operations. In the event that countries in which we operate experience civil or political unrest or acts of terrorism, especially in events where such unrest leads to an unseating of the established government, our operations in such countries could be materially impaired.\nOur international operations may also be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by laws, policies, and regulations of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation, including U.S. trade sanctions.\nRealization of any of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, or qualified personnel. The cost for such items may increase as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, such as increases in the cost of electricity, steel, and other raw materials that we and our vendors rely upon; increased demand for labor, services, and materials as drilling activity increases; and increased taxes. Decreased levels of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry in recent periods have led to declining costs of some drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, or qualified personnel. However, if commodity prices rise, such costs may rise faster than increases in our revenue and their availability to us may be limited. Additionally, these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nDeterioration in the credit or equity markets could adversely affect us.\nWe have exposure to different counterparties. For example, we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to these financial institutions through our derivative transactions. In addition, if any lender under our credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender\u2019s commitment under our credit facilities. Moreover, to the extent that purchasers of our production rely on access to the credit or equity markets to fund their operations, there is a risk that those purchasers could default in their contractual obligations to us if such purchasers were unable to access the credit or equity markets for an extended period of time.\nWe are not insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.\nOur business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production, gathering, processing, and transportation of oil and natural gas, including blowouts; cratering and fire; environmental hazards such as natural-gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and vessel ruptures, and releases of chemicals or other hazardous substances, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and natural-gas wells or formations, production facilities, and other property; pollution or other environmental damage; and injury to persons. For protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, blowout/loss of control of a well, comprehensive general liability, aviation liability, and worker\u2019s compensation and employer\u2019s liability. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us against 100% of potential losses arising as a result of the foregoing and for certain risks, such as political risk, business interruption, war, terrorism, and piracy, for which we have limited or no coverage. In addition, we are not insured against all risks in all aspects of our business such as hurricanes. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nTo the extent that we engage in commodity-price risk-management activities to protect our cash flows from commodity-price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our commodity-price risk-management and trading activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the following occur:\n\u2022\nour production is less than the notional volumes\n\u2022\na widening of price basis differentials occurs between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the derivative arrangement\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to our hedging or other price-risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements\n\u2022\na sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil, natural-gas, or NGLs prices\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation, and the promulgation of regulations pursuant thereto, could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity-price, interest-rate, and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), enacted in 2010, requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market, including swap clearing and trade execution requirements. While many rules and regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, other rules and regulations, including the proposed position limits rule, remain to be finalized or effectuated, and therefore, the impact of those rules and regulations on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, could (i) significantly increase the cost, or decrease the liquidity, of energy-related derivatives we use to hedge against commodity-price fluctuations (including through requirements to post collateral), (ii) materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, and (iii) reduce the availability and use of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable rules and regulations, our cash flow may become more volatile and less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, those transactions may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nMaterial differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the completion of and commencement of production from development projects.\nWe are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. Key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include the following:\n\u2022\nproject approvals and funding by joint-venture partners\n\u2022\ntimely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies or legislative and other governmental approvals\n\u2022\nweather conditions\n\u2022\navailability of qualified personnel\n\u2022\ncivil and political environment of, and existing infrastructure in, the country or region in which the project is located\n\u2022\nmanufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment\n\u2022\ncommercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons\nDelays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the forward-looking statements related to large development projects and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe oil and gas exploration and production industry is very competitive, and some of our exploration and production competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nThe oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, gas marketers, and major pipeline companies as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. Some of our competitors may have greater and more diverse resources on which to draw than we do. If we are not successful in our competition for oil and gas reserves or in our marketing of production, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur drilling activities may not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs. Drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in formations\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents\n\u2022\nfires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering\n\u2022\nmarine risks such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes\n\u2022\ndifficulty identifying and retaining qualified personnel\n\u2022\ntitle problems\n\u2022\nother adverse weather conditions\n\u2022\nlack of availability or delays in the delivery of technology, equipment, or resources for operations\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $1.7 billion in suspended well and associated non-producing leasehold costs related to 11 U.S. offshore and international exploration projects, which includes approximately $800 million related to our Shenandoah project in the Gulf of Mexico. Certain of these future exploration and appraisal drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, could result in a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Because of the percentage of our capital budget devoted to higher-risk exploratory projects, it is likely that we will continue to experience significant exploration and dry hole expenses.\nWe have limited influence over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nOther companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. We have limited ability to influence the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties or the amount or timing of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. Our dependence on the operator and other working-interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital, lead to unexpected future costs, or adversely affect the timing of activities.\nOur ability to sell our oil, natural-gas, and NGLs production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation.\nThe marketability of our production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline facilities and tanker transportation. If any pipelines or tankers become unavailable, we would, to the extent possible, be required to find a suitable alternative to transport the oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which could increase our costs and/or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of the oil and gas.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by goodwill impairments.\nAs a result of mergers and acquisitions, we had approximately $5.0 billion of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016. Goodwill must be tested at least annually for impairment, and more frequently when circumstances indicate likely impairment. Goodwill is considered impaired to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value. Various factors could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit such as our inability to replace the value of our depleting asset base, difficulty or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits, or other adverse events such as lower oil and natural-gas prices, which could lead to an impairment of goodwill. An impairment of goodwill could have a substantial negative effect on our reported earnings.\nRisks related to acquisitions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny acquisition, including the recent GOM Acquisition, involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe validity of our assumptions about, among other things, reserves, estimated production, revenues, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and costs\n\u2022\nthe assumption of environmental, decommissioning, and other liabilities, and losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate\n\u2022\na failure to attain or maintain compliance with environmental, safety, and other governmental regulations\nIf any of these risks materialize, the benefits of such acquisition may not be fully realized, if at all, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and gas producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or those of third parties such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities, and infrastructure may result in increased costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWhile we have experienced cybersecurity attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. In addition, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control of Anadarko, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may make a change of control of Anadarko difficult, even if it may be beneficial to our stockholders, including provisions governing the nomination and removal of directors, the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent and regulation of stockholders\u2019 ability to bring matters for action before annual stockholder meetings, and the authorization given to our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nWe may reduce or cease to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at the current rate or at all. In response to the commodity-price environment, in February 2016, the Company decreased the quarterly dividend from $0.27 per share to $0.05 per share. The amount of cash dividends, if any, to be paid in the future is determined by our Board of Directors based on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, levels of capital and exploration expenditures, future business prospects, expected liquidity needs, and other matters that our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nThe loss of key members of our management team, or difficulty attracting and retaining experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success.\nThe successful implementation of our strategies and handling of other issues integral to our future success will depend, in part, on our experienced management team. The loss of key members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. We do not carry key man insurance. Our exploratory drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced explorationists, engineers, and other professionals. Competition for such professionals could be intense. If we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.", "PERMNO": 70332, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "APC"}
