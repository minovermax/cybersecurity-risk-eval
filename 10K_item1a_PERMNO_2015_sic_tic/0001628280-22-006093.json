{"cik": "1325879", "company": "AVEO PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. These risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our publicly traded securities. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may occur or become material in the future and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our publicly traded securities. Therefore, historical operating results, financial and business performance, events and trends are often not a reliable indicator of future operating results, financial and business performance, events or trends. If any of the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition, and results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating expenses for the foreseeable future. It is uncertain if we will ever achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have a history of incurring operating losses and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $674.5 million. To date, we have not generated significant revenues from the sale of products. Our operating losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our discovery and development activities. On March 10, 2021, the FDA approved FOTIVDA in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC following two or more prior systemic therapies. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we commercialize FOTIVDA in the United States and continue our planned development activities for our clinical stage assets. Our future product revenues will depend upon the size of markets in which FOTIVDA, and any future products, have received approval, and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payers and adequate market share for FOTIVDA and any future products in those markets. The likelihood of our long-term success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties and potential delays to be encountered in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, competitive factors in the marketplace and the complex regulatory environment in which we operate.\nIf we do not effectively manufacture, market and sell FOTIVDA in the United States and if we do not successfully develop, obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our existing and future pipeline of product candidates we may never generate sufficient revenues from product sales to support our cost structure in order to attain or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations.\nWe may require substantial additional funding to advance our pipeline of clinical stage assets, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed would force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research, product development or commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that our $87.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021, along with net product revenues from product sales of FOTIVDA in the United States, would enable us to maintain our current operations for more than 12 months following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHowever, there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products including, without limitation, risks related to our ability to generate product revenue from sales of FOTIVDA in the United States, which became commercially available in the United States in March 2021. Accordingly, our future capital requirements may vary from our current expectations and depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022the cost of commercialization activities of FOTIVDA in the United States and any of our product candidates that may be approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n\u2022the cost of manufacturing FOTIVDA in the United States, our product candidates and any additional products we may successfully commercialize;\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, business and prospects;\n\u2022our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing, collaboration or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u2022the number of product candidates we pursue as well as the development needs and opportunities for each product candidate;\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates and of conducting preclinical and clinical trials;\n\u2022the timing of, and the costs involved in, completing our clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n\u2022the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;\n\u2022the absence of any breach, acceleration event or event of default under our 2020 Loan Facility (as defined below), or under any other agreements with third parties;\n\u2022the cost and outcome of any legal actions against us;\n\u2022the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, FOTIVDA and our future products, if any;\n\u2022and general economic, industry and market conditions, including, without limitation, the current adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and political and economic instability caused by the current armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine and economic sanctions adopted in response to the conflict.\nWe may require substantial additional funding to advance our pipeline of clinical stage assets. We may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock or through additional credit facilities, these securities and/or the loans under credit facilities could provide for rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. For example, we may never achieve the milestone specified in the 2020 Loan Facility that would allow us to access the remaining $5.0 million in available credit. We also expect to seek additional funds through arrangements with partners, licensees, collaborators or other third parties. These arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or product candidates, and we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf we are unable to raise substantial additional funding to advance our pipeline of clinical stage assets, whether on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or if we were to default under the 2020 Loan Facility and Hercules accelerates the then remaining principal payments and fees due under the 2020 Loan Facility, then we may be required to:\n\u2022delay, limit, reduce or terminate our clinical trials or other development activities for one or more of our product candidates; and/or\n\u2022delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved.\nFailure to comply with the covenants or payment obligations under the 2020 Loan Facility could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nThe 2020 Loan Facility includes certain financial and operational covenants and provides for certain occurrences that constitute events of default. Certain of those covenants may be out of our control, such as failure to achieve net product revenue at a certain percentage of projected net product revenue. Potential events of default also include circumstances occurring that would have a material adverse effect on our business, our insolvency or bankruptcy or default on our other obligations or agreements. If we fail to make payments when due, breach any operational covenant or have any event of default, Hercules could require us to immediately repay all outstanding principal and accrued interest on the loan, plus a prepayment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe have only recently transitioned from a development stage biopharmaceutical company to a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nOther than the marketing approvals for FOTIVDA received by our partner EUSA and the FDA marketing approval for FOTIVDA received in the United States in March 2021, all of our product candidates are in the development stage. We have only recently demonstrated our ability, or our ability to arrange for a third party, to manufacture a commercial scale medicine and conduct the sales and marketing activities necessary to commercialize a product. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had more experience commercializing FOTIVDA. In addition, as a relatively new commercial stage business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. To be profitable, we will need to continue to successfully transition from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. Ultimately, we may not be successful in such a transition.\nRisks Related to Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nIn the near term, we are substantially dependent on the success of FOTIVDA (tivozanib). If we are unable to successfully commercialize FOTIVDA or maintain marketing approval for FOTIVDA in its approved indication, or if we are unable to complete planned or ongoing clinical development of tivozanib to obtain marketing approval for tivozanib in other indications, either alone or with our collaborators, or if we experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be substantially harmed.\nOur prospects are substantially dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize FOTIVDA in the United States and maintain marketing approval for FOTIVDA in the United States, or through EUSA, in those countries outside the United States where FOTIVDA is currently approved. While we recorded a growing number of commercial prescriptions, factors beyond our control may result in decreases in commercial prescriptions each month or each quarter. If commercial prescription demand becomes stagnant or decreases it would substantially impact our revenues from product sales, adversely affect our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis and depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe are also dependent on the success of tivozanib in clinical development and our ability to obtain additional marketing approvals for tivozanib in one or more other indications.\nThe success of FOTIVDA will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022our ability to successfully commercialize FOTIVDA in the United States;\n\u2022our ability to enhance commercial awareness of FOTIVDA;\n\u2022commercial acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community;\n\u2022our ability to gain access to customers during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022our ability to successfully enroll and complete clinical trials of tivozanib, including the DEDUCTIVE trial and the TiNivo-2 Trial;\n\u2022a continued acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile that is satisfactory to applicable regulatory authorities following any marketing approval;\n\u2022timely receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities such as the FDA;\n\u2022the performance of the contract research organizations, or CROs, we have hired to manage our clinical trials, as well as that of our collaborators, investigator sponsors and other third-party contractors;\n\u2022the extent of any future post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022maintenance of existing or establishment of new supply arrangements with third-party raw materials suppliers and manufacturers including with respect to the supply of active pharmaceutical ingredient for tivozanib and finished drug product that is appropriately packaged for sale;\n\u2022adequate ongoing availability of raw materials and drug product for clinical development and any commercial sales;\n\u2022obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally, including our ability to maintain our license agreement with KKC;\n\u2022protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio, including our ability to maintain our license agreement with KKC; and\n\u2022our ability to compete with other therapies.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. If we are unable to continue to successfully commercialize FOTIVDA in the United States or to develop or receive marketing approval for tivozanib in other indications, on our own or with our collaborators, or experience delays as a result of any of these factors or otherwise, our business could be substantially harmed.\nFOTIVDA, or any one of our product candidates that may receive marketing approval in the future, may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success and the market opportunity for FOTIVDA or any one of our product candidates may be smaller than our estimates.\nFOTIVDA, or any one of our product candidates that may be approved in the future by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, may fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. Physicians are often reluctant to switch their patients from existing therapies even when new and potentially more effective or convenient treatments enter the market. There are already a number of therapies on the market competitive to FOTIVDA, as well as our other product candidates, in indications we intend to target.\nEfforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates have required significant resources and may not ultimately be successful. Restrictions related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have impeded our ability to gain in-person access to customers, prescribers, other healthcare professionals and to certain institutions that remain closed to industry representatives. We believe these access challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of SARs-CoV-2 variants have potentially slowed the commercial launch trajectory of FOTIVDA which we believe is causing a protracted launch curve as compared to the pre-COVID open access environment. While we have designed our strategic commercial approach to be optimized for remote as well as in-person customer engagement capabilities and expanded our digital marketing strategies in light of the restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to standard sales and marketing practices, including the shift from in-person to video and virtual interactions with healthcare professionals, have caused, and may continue to cause, challenges for the successful commercialization of FOTIVDA.\nIf FOTIVDA, or any of our product candidates that may be approved for marketing and sale in the future, does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance, we may not generate significant revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of FOTIVDA, or any of our product candidates that may be approved for marketing and sale in the future, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the advantages of the product compared to competitive therapies;\n\u2022the number of competitors approved for similar uses;\n\u2022our ability to gain access to customers during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the relative promotional effort and marketing success of us as compared with our competitors;\n\u2022how the product is positioned in physician treatment guidelines and pathways;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022the efficacy and safety of the product;\n\u2022our ability to offer the product for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022the product\u2019s tolerability, convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022the willingness of the target patient population to try, and of physicians to prescribe, the product;\n\u2022limitations or warnings, including use restrictions, contained in the product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u2022the strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022the timing of market introduction of our approved products as well as competitive products;\n\u2022adverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n\u2022potential product liability claims;\n\u2022changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications of the product; and\n\u2022availability and amount of coverage and reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third-party payors.\nIn addition, the potential market opportunities for FOTIVDA and our product candidates are difficult to estimate precisely. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities are predicated on many assumptions, including industry knowledge and publications, third-party research reports and other surveys. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment on the part of our management, are inherently uncertain and the reasonableness of these assumptions has not been assessed by an independent source. If any of the assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the actual markets for our product candidate could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunities.\nIf the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities approve generic versions of FOTIVDA\u00ae, the sales of FOTIVDA\u00ae could be adversely affected.\nOnce an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \u201creference listed drug\u201d in the FDA\u2019s publication, \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\u201d commonly known as the Orange Book. Manufacturers may seek approval of generic versions of reference listed drugs through submission of abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, in the United States. In support of an ANDA, a generic manufacturer need not conduct clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy. Rather, the applicant generally must show that its product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration and conditions of use or labelling as the reference listed drug and that the generic version is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent. Generic products may be significantly less costly to bring to market than the reference listed drug and companies that produce generic products are generally able to offer them at lower prices. Thus, following the introduction of a generic drug, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product or reference listed drug is typically lost to the generic product.\nThe FDA may not approve an ANDA for a generic product until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the reference listed drug has expired. The FDA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. Specifically, in cases where such exclusivity has been granted, as is the case with FOTIVDA\u00ae, an ANDA may not be submitted to the FDA until the expiration of five years, e.g., March 10, 2026, for FOTIVDA\u00ae, unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification that a patent covering the reference listed drug is either invalid or will not be infringed by the generic product, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following approval of the reference listed drug, e.g., March 10, 2025, for FOTIVDA\u00ae.\nGeneric drug manufacturers may seek to launch generic products following the expiration of the applicable exclusivity period for FOTIVDA\u00ae, even if we still have patent protection for such products. Competition that FOTIVDA\u00ae could face from generic versions could materially and adversely affect our future revenue, profitability, and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in developing FOTIVDA\u00ae.\nIn addition to our dependence on the success of FOTIVDA, we depend on the success of our clinical stage assets, including tivozanib (in other indications), ficlatuzumab, AV-380 and AV-203. Preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may not be successful. If we are unable to complete the clinical development of, obtain marketing approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates, either alone or with a collaborator, or if we experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe and any collaborators, including our partners and sublicensees, are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate in the United States without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA. Foreign regulatory authorities, such as the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, impose similar requirements. We and our collaborators must complete extensive preclinical development and clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans before we can obtain these approvals. Despite our efforts to design satisfactory clinical trial protocols, we cannot guarantee that the clinical trial protocols of any of our ongoing clinical trials will satisfy the rigorous standards of the FDA and/or the EMA to support a marketing approval. If we seek to amend the clinical trial protocols for any of our clinical trials this may delay site enrollment and completion, as in the case of the TiNivo-2 Trial where we made a clinical trial protocol amendment. The TiNivo-2 trial protocol was amended based on (i) emerging evidence that the lower 0.89 mg dose was effective in combination with an ICI, (ii) that the lower dose may optimize the risk/benefit profile and result in better tolerability for the combination and (iii) the FDA\u2019s recommendation to investigate an optimal dose of tivozanib in the combination setting under its Project Optimus initiative. We cannot be certain that this\namendment to the TiNivo-2 protocol will satisfy the FDA's Project Optimus initiative to investigate the optimal dose of tivozanib in the combination setting and, if it does not, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials which would delay and adversely impact the timing of marketing approval of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab or other therapies.\nWe depend heavily on the success of our clinical stage assets and our clinical trials may not be successful. If delays in manufacturing, trial site initiation or patient enrollment occur, whether due to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, our clinical stage assets will develop at a slower pace than we had planned. For example, the delivery of the clinical supply of ficlatuzumab for a potential registrational clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in R/M HNSCC was significantly delayed due to the shortage of key raw materials and manufacturing supplies also used in COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing which required us to delay the start date of this potential registrational clinical trial until 2023.\nPreclinical and clinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is inherently uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all, particularly given that many of our clinical trial sites are research hospitals that have imposed restrictions on entry and other activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates is susceptible to the risk of failure inherent at any stage of product development. For example, in December 2020, the FDA approved our investigational new drug, or IND, application for AV-380 for the potential treatment of cancer cachexia. In October 2021, we completed enrollment for a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy subjects. Initial data observed satisfactory a reduction of GDF15 in subjects and no drug related adverse events were identified. However, operational errors at the trial site have caused data integrity concerns and we have notified the FDA. We plan to discuss with the FDA the suitability of the data for regulatory purposes and our ability to publish the data from this trial. We do not expect the data quality issues in the Phase 1 clinical trial to impact our plans to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial in cancer patients in the second half of 2022. We cannot be certain that the data integrity concerns related to the Phase 1 clinical trial will not ultimately delay the development of our AV-380 program.\nMoreover, we, or any collaborators, may experience any of a number of possible unforeseen adverse events in connection with clinical trials, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022we, or our collaborators, may fail to demonstrate efficacy in a clinical trial or across a broad population of patients;\n\u2022the supply or quality of raw materials, manufactured product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be significantly delayed, insufficient, inadequate or not available at an acceptable cost, or we may experience interruptions in supply, due to challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise;\n\u2022it is possible that even if one or more of our product candidates has a beneficial effect, that effect (a) will not be detected during preclinical or clinical evaluation or (b) may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect as a result of one or more of a variety of factors, including the size, duration, design, measurements, conduct or analysis of our clinical trials;\n\u2022we may fail to detect toxicity or intolerability of our product candidates, or mistakenly believe that our product candidates are toxic or not well tolerated when that is not in fact the case;\n\u2022adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, any product candidates that we may develop could cause us, any collaborators, an institutional review board or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of one or more of our product candidates and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022if any of our product candidates is associated with adverse events or undesirable side effects or has properties that are unexpected, we, or any collaborators, may need to abandon development or limit development of that product candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective;\n\u2022regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us, any collaborators or our or their investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022we, or any collaborators, may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022clinical trials of our product candidates may produce unfavorable or inconclusive results, including with respect to the safety, tolerability, efficacy or pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of the product candidate;\n\u2022we, or any collaborators, may decide, or regulators may require us or them, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we, or any collaborators, anticipate, patient enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we, or any collaborators, anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we, or any collaborators, anticipate;\n\u2022our estimates of the patient populations available for study may be higher than actual patient numbers and result in our inability to sufficiently enroll our trials;\n\u2022the cost of planned clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022our third-party contractors or those of any collaborators, including those manufacturing our product candidates or components or ingredients thereof or conducting clinical trials on our behalf or on behalf of any collaborators, may fail to comply with regulatory requirements, including GMPs, GCPs or GLPs, or meet their contractual obligations to us or any collaborators in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022patients that enroll in a clinical trial may misrepresent their eligibility to do so or may otherwise not comply with the clinical trial protocol, resulting in the need to increase the needed enrollment size for the clinical trial, extend the clinical trial\u2019s duration, or drop the patients from the final efficacy analysis for the clinical trial, which can negatively affect the statistical power of the results;\n\u2022our decision, or a decision by regulators or institutional review boards, that may require us to suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or their standards of conduct, a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics of the product candidate or findings of undesirable effects caused by a chemically or mechanistically similar product or product candidate;\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our, or any collaborators\u2019, clinical trial designs or our or their interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we, or any collaborators, enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u2022the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient to obtain marketing approval; and\n\u2022constraints on our, or any collaborators\u2019, ability to conduct or complete clinical trials for our product candidates due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including slowdowns in patient enrollment, or necessary supplies, restrictions on patient monitoring at hospital clinical trial sites, closures of third-party facilities, and other disruptions to clinical trial activities.\nProduct development costs for us and our collaborators will increase if we experience delays in testing or pursuing marketing approvals, and we may be required to obtain additional funds to complete clinical trials and prepare for possible commercialization. We do not know whether any clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule or at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that lead to clinical trial delays may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of any of our product candidates.\nIf the commercial launch of FOTIVDA for which we recruited a sales force and established marketing, market access and medical affairs teams and distribution capabilities is not successful for any reason, we could incur substantial costs\nand our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reassign our sales, marketing, market access and medical affairs personnel.\nTo achieve commercial success for FOTIVDA, we have expended and anticipate that we will continue to expend significant resources to support our sales force, marketing, market access and medical affairs teams and distribution capabilities. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing, distribution, training and support capabilities. For example, recruiting and training sales and marketing personnel is expensive and time consuming and could delay our ability to focus on other priorities. If the commercial launch of FOTIVDA is not successful for any reason, this would be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reassign our sales, marketing, market access and medical affairs personnel or terminate on favorable terms any agreements entered into with third parties to support our commercialization efforts.\nFactors that may inhibit or limit our efforts to commercialize FOTIVDA on our own include:\n\u2022our inability to train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales, marketing, training and support personnel;\n\u2022the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians, including key opinion leaders, or to educate an adequate number of physicians of the benefits of FOTIVDA over alternative treatment options;\n\u2022limited access to our customers due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022unforeseen costs and expenses associated with establishing and maintaining an independent sales, marketing, training and support organization.\nIf our salesforce, marketing, market access and medical affairs teams and distribution capabilities fail, or are otherwise unsuccessful, it would materially adversely impact the commercialization of FOTIVDA, impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business.\nIf we fail to develop and commercialize other product candidates, we may be unable to grow our business.\nAlthough the commercialization of FOTIVDA and the continued development of tivozanib is our primary focus, as part of our growth strategy, we are developing a pipeline of product candidates. These other product candidates will require additional, time-consuming and costly development efforts, by us or by our collaborators, prior to commercial sale, including preclinical studies, clinical trials and approval by the FDA and/or applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to the risks of failure that are inherent in pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and/or effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot assure you that any such products that are approved will be manufactured or produced economically, successfully commercialized or widely accepted in the marketplace, or will be more effective than other commercially available alternatives.\nWe may not obtain additional marketing approvals for tivozanib in other indications or initial approval for our other product candidates.\nWe may not obtain additional marketing approvals for our product candidates. It is possible that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory agencies may refuse to accept for substantive review any future application that we or a collaborator may submit to market and sell our product candidates, or that any such agency may conclude after review of our or our collaborator\u2019s data that such application is insufficient to obtain marketing approval of our product candidate.\nIf the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory agency does not accept or approve any future application to market and sell any of our product candidates, such regulators may require that we conduct additional clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing validation studies and submit that data before they will reconsider our application. Depending on the extent of these or any other required trials or studies, approval of any application that we submit may be delayed by several years, or may require us or our collaborator to expend more resources than we or they have available. It is also possible that additional trials or studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA or other foreign regulatory agency to approve our applications for marketing and commercialization.\nAny delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, marketing approvals would prevent us or our collaborators from commercializing tivozanib in other indications or our product candidates and generating revenues. If any of these outcomes occur, we would not be eligible for certain milestone and royalty revenue under our partnership agreements, our\ncollaborators could terminate our partnership agreements and we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for our product candidates, any of which could significantly harm our business.\nResults of early clinical trials may not be predictive of results of later clinical trials, and interim results of clinical trials may not be predictive of the final results or the success of clinical trials.\nThe outcome of early clinical trials, such as our DEDUCTIVE trial and our ficlatuzumab trials in HNSCC, pancreatic cancer and AML, may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in earlier development, and we have, and could in the future, face similar setbacks. In addition, interim results and analyses of clinical trials do not necessarily predict the final results or the success of a trial once it is complete.\nWhile the design of a clinical trial may help to establish whether its results will support approval of a product, flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates. Even if we, or any collaborators, believe that the results of clinical trials for our product candidates warrant marketing approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree and may not grant marketing approval of our product candidates. For example, in June 2013, we suffered such a setback when the FDA issued a complete response letter, or the 2013 CRL, informing us that it would not approve tivozanib for the first-line treatment of RCC based solely on the data from the TIVO-1 trial, and recommended that we perform an additional clinical trial adequately sized to assure the FDA that tivozanib did not adversely affect overall survival, or OS. We then designed and initiated our TIVO-3 trial to address the FDA\u2019s concerns about the negative OS trend expressed in the 2013 CRL, which took time and resources and delayed our efforts to obtain marketing approval for tivozanib in the United States.\nIf we fail to receive positive results in clinical trials of our product candidates, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for our most advanced product candidates, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects would be negatively impacted.\nIf we or our collaborators experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe or our collaborators may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in clinical trials. Patient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, and is affected by many factors, including:\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the size and nature of the patient population;\n\u2022the severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022the availability of approved therapeutics for the relevant disease;\n\u2022the evolving standard of care landscape;\n\u2022the proximity of patients to clinical sites;\n\u2022the design of and eligibility criteria for the trial;\n\u2022efforts to facilitate timely enrollment; and\n\u2022competing clinical trials.\nIn addition, participation in our clinical trials will be affected by clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages and risks of the drug being studied and the drug being provided as a control in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved or any changes to the standard of care for the indications we are investigating. For example, changes in the standard of care in HCC have extended treatment time with first line therapies and reduced the presence of a sufficient patient pool suitable for the DEDUCTIVE trial, which has delayed patient enrollment for the trial.\nIf approved, our product candidates, such as ficlatuzumab, AV-380, or AV-203, that are licensed and regulated as biologics may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway.\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, to establish an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an approved biologic. Under the BPCIA, our antibody product candidates, for example, ficlatuzumab, AV-380 or AV-203, if approved by the FDA, would benefit from 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure. While the FDA could not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on our biologic product candidates, such as ficlatuzumab, AV-380 or AV-203, as the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of our product candidate, during this 12-year period of exclusivity, another party may still independently develop and receive approval of a competing biologic, so long as its BLA does not rely on our product candidate\u2019s data or submit the application as a biosimilar application. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty, and any new policies or processes adopted by the FDA could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that any of the biological product candidates we develop under a BLA, such as ficlatuzumab, AV-380 or AV-203, should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider the subject product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of the reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. Nonetheless, the approval of a biosimilar to our biologic product candidates, such as ficlatuzumab, AV-380 or AV-203, would have a material adverse impact on our business due to increased competition and pricing pressure.\nEven if a product candidate receives marketing approval, we or others may later discover that the product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, which could compromise our ability or that of any collaborators to market the product, and could cause regulatory authorities to take certain regulatory actions.\nIt is possible that our clinical trials may indicate an apparent positive effect of a product candidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any, or alternatively fail to identify undesirable side effects. For example, despite the recent FDA marketing approval of FOTIVDA in the United States, we, or others, may discover that FOTIVDA is less effective or tolerable than previously believed. If, we, or others, discover that a product is less effective than previously believed or causes undesirable side effects that were not previously identified, any of the following adverse events could occur:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or seize the product;\n\u2022we, or any of our collaborators, may be required to recall the product, change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u2022additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of, or the manufacturing processes for, the particular product;\n\u2022we, or any of our collaborators, may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u2022we, or any of our collaborators, may be required to create a Medication Guide outlining the risks of the previously unidentified side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022physicians and patients may stop using our product; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could harm our business and operations and could negatively impact our stock price.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we intend to focus on developing product candidates for specific indications that we identify as most likely to succeed, in terms of their potential for marketing approval and commercialization, as well as those that are most aligned with our strategic goals. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that may prove to have greater commercial potential.\nOur resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable product candidates. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to the product candidate.\nWe face substantial competition from existing approved products. Our competitors may also discover, develop or commercialize new competing products before, or more successfully, than we do.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive, and our future success depends on our ability to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the design, development and commercialization of product candidates. Our core competitors include pharmaceutical and biotech organizations, as well as academic research institutions, clinical research laboratories and government agencies that are focusing on the research and development of small molecules and antibodies for cancer treatment. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Established competitors may invest heavily to discover and develop novel compounds that could make our product candidates obsolete.\nFor instance, there are several therapies in clinical development for RCC, HCC and HNSCC that may alter the competitive landscape for the treatment of these cancers. As such, it is difficult to predict how these changes will inform our perspective on the key competitors for our products in RCC, HCC and HNSCC in the future. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety in order to obtain approval, to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful.\nMergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in favor of our competitors. Additionally, many competitors have greater experience in product discovery and development, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals and commercialization capabilities, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. If we are not able to compete effectively, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nWe believe that our ability to compete will depend on our ability to execute on the following objectives:\n\u2022design studies, execute on development plans and commercialize products that are competitive to other products in the market in terms of, among other things, safety, efficacy, convenience or price;\n\u2022obtain and maintain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our processes and product candidates;\n\u2022obtain required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022obtain favorable reimbursement, formulary and guideline status;\n\u2022collaborate with others in the design, development and commercialization of our products; and\n\u2022evaluate and pursue strategic business development and partnership opportunities for our programs.\nFOTIVDA, or any other product candidate that we or our collaborators are able to commercialize, may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party payor reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, any of which could harm our business.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by third-party payors, including government health care programs and private health insurers. For example, our European licensee for FOTIVDA, EUSA, is working to secure reimbursement approval for and commercially launch FOTIVDA in many of the countries in which FOTIVDA has been approved. However, there is significant competition in the first-line RCC setting in the EU due to the approval of several immunotherapy combinations which have become a standard of care and impacted the market opportunity for monotherapy treatments. If EUSA is unable to secure reimbursement approval, or reimbursement is limited, and if EUSA is unable to commercially launch FOTIVDA in additional countries and does not seek to expand the label for FOTIVDA to the relapsed or refractory RCC setting, it may materially impact our ability to generate revenue from sales of FOTIVDA outside of the United States. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us or our collaborators to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investments. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors, and coverage and reimbursement levels for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often time consuming and costly and may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained or applied consistently.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs. Marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we or our collaborators might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which may negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our or their investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nPatients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Therefore, our ability, and the ability of any collaborators, to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. The healthcare industry is acutely focused on cost containment, both in the United States and elsewhere. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. These payors may not view our products, even if approved, as cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to our customers or may not be sufficient to allow our products to be marketed on a competitive basis. Cost-control initiatives could cause us or our collaborators to decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in lower than anticipated product revenues. If the prices for our products, if any, decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide coverage or adequate reimbursement, our prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer.\nThere may also be delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, such as FOTIVDA, and coverage may be more limited for FOTIVDA than the indication for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Reimbursement rates may vary, for example, according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used. Reimbursement rates may also be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs or may be incorporated into existing payments for other services.\nIn addition, increasingly, third-party payors are requiring higher levels of evidence of the benefits and clinical outcomes of new technologies and are challenging the prices charged. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product candidate that we, or third-parties, commercialize and, if available, that the reimbursement rates will be adequate. Further, the net reimbursement for drug products may be subject to additional reductions if there are changes to laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United\nStates. An inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any of our product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval could significantly harm our operating results and our overall financial condition.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face a risk of product liability as a result of the commercialization of FOTIVDA and the clinical testing of our product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Even a successful defense could require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased commercial demand for FOTIVDA, resulting in loss of revenue;\n\u2022delay or termination of our clinical trials, or the withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022the inability to develop or commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022injury to our reputation and negative media attention; and\n\u2022a decline in our stock price.\nAlthough we maintain general liability insurance and clinical trial liability insurance, this insurance may not fully cover potential liabilities that we may incur. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive. We increased our insurance coverage for the commercialization of FOTIVDA and we will need to increase our insurance coverage further if we commercialize any of our other products that receive marketing approval. If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, it could prevent or inhibit the development, commercial production and sale of our product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur internal computer systems or other company technology to collect and store information, or those of any third parties with which we contract, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such systems are also vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber incidents by malicious third parties. Our sensitive commercial and personal information also may be subject to security breaches in other contexts, related to personal devices or other technology or systems where this information can be collected, stored and used. Cyber incidents are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber incidents could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to or deletion of files, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Cyber incidents also could include phishing attempts or e-mail fraud to cause payments or information to be transmitted to an unintended recipient. We could be subject to risks caused by cyber incidents, misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of information maintained in the information systems and networks of our company, including commercial information and personal information of our employees, patients, clinical trial participants and third-party vendors.\nSystem failures, accidents, cyber incidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations, and could result in a material disruption of our commercialization and clinical activities and business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future trials\ncould result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, our competitive position could be harmed and our product research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed. We may in certain instances be required to provide notification to individuals or others in connection with the loss of their personal or commercial information. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to provide compensation for any losses associated with such events.\nIf a material breach of our security or that of our vendors occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose business and our reputation and credibility could be damaged. We could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair or replace information systems or networks. Although we develop and maintain systems and controls designed to prevent these events from occurring, and we have a process to identify and mitigate threats, the development and maintenance of these systems, controls and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely disrupted, and is expected to continue to adversely disrupt our operations, including our ability to commercialize FOTIVDA by restricting in-person access to treating oncologists and restricting in-person access to certain institutions, our ability to initiate new trials or complete ongoing clinical trials and our ability to manufacture clinical product and may have other adverse effects on our business, operations and ability to raise capital.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which began in December 2019 and has spread worldwide, has caused many governments to implement measures to slow the spread of the outbreak through quarantines, strict travel restrictions, heightened border scrutiny and other measures. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred, supply chains have been disrupted, facilities and production have been suspended, and demand for certain goods and services, such as manufacturing materials, medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. The future progression of the pandemic and its effects on our business and operations are uncertain.\nRestrictions related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have impeded our ability to gain in-person access to customers, prescribers, and other healthcare professionals and certain institutions remain closed to industry representatives. We believe these access challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of SARs-CoV-2 variants have potentially slowed the commercial launch trajectory of FOTIVDA which we believe is causing a protracted launch curve as compared to the pre-COVID open access environment. While we have designed our strategic commercial approach to be optimized for remote as well as in-person customer engagement capabilities and expanded our digital marketing strategies in light of the restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to standard sales and marketing practices, including the shift from in-person to video and virtual interactions with healthcare professionals, have caused, and may continue to cause, challenges for the successful commercialization of FOTIVDA.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted the initiation, enrollment and completion of certain of our ongoing and planned clinical trials both in the United States and in the EU. For example, the pandemic partially slowed enrollment of the DEDUCTIVE trial in that it hindered patients' ability to attend routine physical medical assessments with their clinicians resulting in delays in diagnosis and, at times, treatment of cancer in patients. In addition, in-person monitoring visits are currently on hold at certain of the active clinical trial sites for our DEDUCTIVE trial and to the extent possible, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, monitoring is being conducted remotely. We do not yet know whether remote management of this function will prove to be sufficient.\nSimilarly, the CRO for our TiNivo-2 trial has been impacted by cancer research staffing shortages related to, among other things, COVID-19 infections and competition for staff at clinical trial sites resulting in delays to site initiation, contracting and enrollment. Currently, certain academic institutions have frozen enrollment on all trials or refused to take on additional clinical trials due to these staffing shortages and these staffing shortages have adversely impacted trial site initiation and enrollment of the TiNivo-2 trial.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has delayed and may continue to delay or otherwise adversely affect these clinical development activities, including our ability to recruit and retain patients in our ongoing clinical trials, as a result of many factors, including:\n\u2022diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of our clinical trials in order to focus on pandemic concerns, including the availability of necessary materials, including manufacturing supplies, the attention of physicians serving as our clinical trial investigators, access to hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites, availability of hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials and the reluctance of patients enrolled in our clinical trials to visit clinical trial sites;\n\u2022potential interruptions in global shipping affecting the transport of clinical trial materials, such as investigational drug product, patient samples and other supplies used in our clinical trials;\n\u2022the impact of further limitations on travel that could interrupt key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site initiations and monitoring activities, travel by our employees, contractors or patients to clinical trial sites or the ability of employees at any of our CMO or CROs to report to work, any of which could delay or adversely impact the conduct or progress of our clinical trials, and limit the amount of clinical data we will be able to report;\n\u2022any future interruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of clinical trial material from our contract manufacturing organizations or, in the case of combination trials, our study collaborators, due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages or disruptions in delivery systems; and\n\u2022availability of future capacity at CMOs to produce sufficient drug substance and drug product to meet forecasted clinical trial demand if any of these manufacturers elect or are required to divert attention or resources to the manufacture of other pharmaceutical products.\nThe extent of any adverse impact on our clinical trials will depend on numerous evolving factors that cannot be predicted with any level of certainty.\nAny negative impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has on the ability of our suppliers to provide materials for our product candidates could cause additional delays with respect to product development activities, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to initiate or complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our product candidates, increase our operating expenses, affect our ability to raise additional capital and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has, and may continue to, cause delays in the manufacturing of our product candidates ficlatuzumab and AV-380. A shortage of required key raw materials and manufacturing supplies also used in COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing process delayed the delivery of the clinical supply of ficlatuzumab originally expected in the first half of 2022 and will require the Company to delay the start date of this potential registrational clinical trial until the first half of 2023, which, if approved, may impact timing of potential commercialization and associated revenue generation. Similarly, a separate CMO has experienced employee shortages, supply chain issues and disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic which has delayed and may continue to delay manufacturing of AV-380. While we believe there are alternate manufacturers with capability to supply clinical or, if approved, commercial supply of AV-380 necessary to meet our needs, contracting with additional CMOs would require significant lead-times and result in additional costs and currently is not the solution we expect to follow.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate scope, duration and effects are unknown. The extent of the impact of the disruptions to our business, the supply chain, preclinical studies, clinical trials and commercialization efforts as a result of the outbreak will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The macroeconomic impacts arising from the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply chain disruptions, may have prolonged and unforeseen adverse impacts to our industry, business and operations. In addition, this pandemic has adversely impacted economies worldwide and may cause additional disruption in the financial markets, both of which could result in adverse effects on our business, operations and ability to raise capital.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties, such as CROs, to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates, and if they do not properly and successfully perform their obligations to us, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nWe, in consultation with our collaborators, where applicable, design the clinical trials for our product candidates, but we rely on CROs and other third parties to perform many of the functions in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out many of these trials. We compete with larger companies for the resources of these third parties. In addition, these third parties may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAlthough we plan to continue to rely on these third parties to conduct our ongoing and any future clinical trials, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, including GCPs and GLPs for designing, conducting, monitoring, recording, analyzing and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their duties under their agreements with us, if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain, process and analyze is compromised for any reason or if they otherwise fail to comply with clinical trial protocols or meet expected deadlines, our clinical trials may experience delays or may fail to meet regulatory requirements. For example, the third-party CRO that conducted our AV-380 Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety of AV-380 in healthy subjects failed to comply with regulatory requirements applicable to the clinical trial, including GCPs and GLPs, which resulted in data integrity concerns. We have notified the FDA and plan to discuss the errors that occurred at the trial site with the FDA to confirm whether we will be able to publish the data from this trial and the suitability of the data for regulatory purposes. If the FDA determines that the data from the clinical trial is not suitable for use, our development of AV-380 may be delayed.\nThe third parties on whom we rely generally may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we are required to enter into alternative arrangements because of any such termination, the introduction of our product candidates to market could be delayed. If our clinical trials do not meet regulatory requirements or if these third parties need to be replaced, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated. If any of these events occur, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and our reputation could be harmed.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers and third-party suppliers to produce, supply, store and transport our preclinical and clinical product candidate supplies, and we rely on third-parties to produce, store and distribute commercial supplies of FOTIVDA. Any failure by a third-party manufacturer or a third-party supplier to timely produce or provide required manufacturing supplies for us or to safely store product candidate supplies and commercial supplies of FOTIVDA may delay or impair our ability to manufacture product, initiate or complete our clinical trials or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have relied upon third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing purposes and intend to continue to do so in the future. If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of such product candidates or to market them.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including reliance on the third-party for regulatory compliance, quality assurance and safe-keeping of our product candidate supplies, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third-party because of factors beyond our control, failure of the third-party to accept orders for supply of drug substance or drug product and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third-party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMPs or failure to scale-up manufacturing processes as needed, including any failure to safely transport and deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates. In addition, such failure could be the basis for action by the FDA to withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us and for other regulatory action, including recall or seizure, fines, imposition of operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production or injunctions.\nWe rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our clinical studies and commercial manufacturing. There are a small number of suppliers of raw and starting materials that we use to manufacture our product candidates, many of whom have experienced delays and challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such suppliers may not be able to provide these materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms. For example, the delivery of the clinical supply of ficlatuzumab for a potential registrational clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in R/M HNSCC was significantly delayed due to the shortage of key raw materials and manufacturing supplies also used in COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing, which required us to delay the start date of this potential registrational clinical trial until 2023. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these materials by our manufacturers and delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic to provide raw and starting materials that we use to manufacture our product candidates could delay or disrupt our ability to initiate or continue clinical trials on our scheduled timelines or at all, which may impact timing of potential commercialization and associated revenue generation.\nMore recently, one of our CMOs has experienced employee shortages, supply chain issues and disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic which have delayed and may continue to delay manufacturing of AV-380 preclinical supply. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or the raw material components thereof for a scheduled or ongoing clinical trial due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to replace a third-party supplier or other factors could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nBecause of the complex nature of many of our early stage compounds and product candidates, our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture such compounds and product candidates at a cost or quantity or in the timeframe necessary to develop and commercialize the related products. As our product development pipeline matures, we will have a greater need for commercial manufacturing capacity and we may be required to establish or access large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities. In addition, we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates and we currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, third parties with whom we currently work may need to increase their scale of production or we may need to secure alternate suppliers.\nWe rely on third parties to securely store product candidate supplies and commercial supplies of FOTIVDA. While we have sought to protect our product candidate supplies and commercial supplies of FOTIVDA through diversification of storage locations, there are times when such supplies may be placed in jeopardy due to unforeseen circumstances such as the disruption to the supply chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. If our product candidate supplies or commercial supplies of FOTIVDA were lost, destroyed, significantly delayed or otherwise compromised, it would delay or impair our ability to complete clinical trials and commercialize FOTIVDA.\nWe rely on our licensee EUSA, over whom we have little control, for the sales, marketing and distribution efforts associated with the commercialization of FOTIVDA in certain countries in the EUSA territory and any failure by EUSA to devote the necessary resources and attention to market and sell FOTIVDA effectively and successfully may materially impact our ability to generate revenue from the EUSA licensed territory.\nIn December 2015, we entered into the EUSA Agreement, under which we granted to EUSA the exclusive, sublicensable right to develop, manufacture and commercialize FOTIVDA in the territories of Europe (excluding Russia, Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States), Latin America (excluding Mexico), Africa and Australasia for all diseases and conditions in humans, excluding non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye. We have limited contractual rights to force EUSA to invest significantly in the commercialization of FOTIVDA in jurisdictions covered by the EUSA Agreement. For instance, under the EUSA Agreement, EUSA is not required to opt into the data from the TIVO-3 trial to seek to expand the label for FOTIVDA to the relapsed or refractory RCC setting and, to date, has not chosen to do so. Further, in December 2021, EUSA announced that it had signed an agreement with Recordati, S.p.A. to be acquired and has indicated that the acquisition is anticipated to close in the first half of 2022. In the event that EUSA, or Recordati, fails to adequately commercialize FOTIVDA because it lacks adequate financial or other resources, decides to focus on other initiatives or otherwise, our ability to successfully commercialize FOTIVDA in the applicable jurisdictions would be limited, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, the EUSA Agreement may be terminated by either party upon prior written notice. If EUSA, or Recordati upon the closing of its acquisition of EUSA, terminated the EUSA Agreement, we may not be able to secure an alternative distributor in the applicable territories on a timely basis or at all, in which case our ability to generate revenue from sales of FOTIVDA outside the United States would be materially harmed.\nFurther, while EUSA is working to secure reimbursement approval in and commercially launch FOTIVDA in additional countries in the EUSA territory, there is significant competition in the first-line RCC setting in the EU due to the approval of several immunotherapy combinations which have become a standard of care and impacted the market opportunity for monotherapy treatments. If EUSA, or Recordati upon the closing of its acquisition of EUSA, is unable to secure reimbursement approval in and commercially launch FOTIVDA in additional countries in the EUSA territory and does not seek to expand the label for FOTIVDA to the relapsed or refractory RCC setting, it may materially impact our ability to generate revenue from sales of FOTIVDA outside the United States.\nWe may not be successful in establishing or maintaining strategic partnerships to further the development of our therapeutic programs. Additionally, if any of our current or future strategic partners fails to perform its obligations or terminates the partnership, the development and commercialization of the product candidates under such agreement could be delayed or terminated. Such failures could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business.\nOur success will depend in significant part on our ability to attract and maintain strategic partners and strategic relationships with other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to support the development and commercialization of our product candidates. In these partnerships, we would expect our strategic partner to provide capabilities in research, development, regulatory filings, marketing and sales, in addition to funding.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for any product candidates and programs because our product candidates may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort or third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential.\nIf we are not able to establish and maintain strategic partnerships:\n\u2022the development of certain of our product candidates may be delayed or terminated;\n\u2022the internal cash expenditures needed to develop such product candidates would increase significantly, and we may not have the cash resources to develop such product candidates on our own; and\n\u2022we may have fewer resources with which to continue to operate our business.\nEven if we are successful in our efforts to establish new strategic partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us. If any strategic partner were to breach or terminate its arrangements with us, the development and commercialization of the affected product candidate could be delayed, curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue development and commercialization of the product candidate on our own. If any current or future strategic partners do not devote sufficient time and resources to their arrangements with us, we may not realize the potential commercial benefits of the arrangement, and our results of operations may be adversely affected. For example, in March 2020, CANbridge advised us that it was evaluating alternative development plans for AV-203, which would delay the initiation of clinical trials of AV-203. Then, in March 2021, CANbridge exercised its right to terminate the CANbridge Agreement for convenience. The transfer of the AV-203 program occurred in September 2021, which has delayed the initiation of clinical trials of AV-203 even further.\nOur current partners and licensees can terminate their agreements with us under various conditions, including without cause, at which point they would no longer continue to develop our products. For example, in September 2020 Biodesix exercised its Opt-Out right under the Biodesix Agreement. As a result, Biodesix is not required to contribute to the future development costs of ficlatuzumab in exchange for a reduced economic interest in any future ficlatuzumab revenues.\nMuch of the potential revenue from any of our strategic partnerships will likely consist of contingent payments, such as development milestones and royalties payable on sales of any successfully developed drugs. Any such contingent revenue will depend upon our, and our strategic partners\u2019, ability to successfully develop, introduce, market and sell new drugs. In some cases, we are not involved in these processes, and we depend entirely on our strategic partners. Any of our strategic partners may fail to develop or effectively commercialize these drugs because it:\n\u2022decides not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints, such as limited personnel with the requisite scientific expertise, limited cash resources or specialized equipment\nlimitations, or the belief that other product candidates may have a higher likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval or may potentially generate a greater return on investment;\n\u2022does not have sufficient resources necessary to carry the product candidate through clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization; or\n\u2022cannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals.\nIf one or more of our strategic partners fails to develop or effectively commercialize product candidates for any reason, we may not be able to replace the strategic partner with another partner to develop and commercialize a product candidate under the terms of the strategic partnership. We may also be unable to obtain, on terms acceptable to us, a license from such strategic partner to any of its intellectual property that may be necessary or useful for us to continue to develop and commercialize a product candidate. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and our ability to achieve future profitability and could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur operations or those of the third parties upon whom we depend might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster, pandemic, war or other catastrophic event.\nWe depend on our employees, consultants, CMOs, CROs, as well as regulatory agencies and other parties, for the continued operation of our business. While we maintain disaster recovery plans, they might not adequately protect us. Despite any precautions we take for natural disasters or other catastrophic events, these events, including terrorist attacks, pandemics, hurricanes, fires, floods and ice and snowstorms, could result in significant disruptions to our research and development, preclinical studies, clinical trials, and, ultimately, commercialization of our products. Long-term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events, such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war (including expansion of the current armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine), the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism or other \u201cacts of God,\u201d particularly involving cities in which we have offices, manufacturing or clinical trial sites, could adversely affect our businesses. Although we carry business interruption insurance policies and typically have provisions in our contracts that protect us in certain events, our coverage might not include or be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us, our CMOs, our CROs, regulatory agencies or other parties with which we are engaged could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights\nWe could be unsuccessful in obtaining or maintaining adequate patent protection for one or more of our product candidates, or the scope of our patent protection could be insufficiently broad, which could result in competition and a decrease in the potential market share for our product candidates.\nWe cannot be certain that patents will be issued or granted with respect to applications that are currently pending, or that issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid and/or unenforceable. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies is generally uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards applied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents. Consequently, patents may not issue from our pending patent applications. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection that we will have on our proprietary products and technology. For example, we have filed a patent application directed to our clinical protocol for using tivozanib to treat refractory cancers, including, following therapy with checkpoint inhibitors. It is possible that we may not successfully obtain a granted patent based upon this patent application. The scope of patent protection that the USPTO will grant with respect to the antibodies in our antibody product pipeline is also uncertain. It is possible that the USPTO will not allow broad antibody claims that cover closely related antibodies as well as the specific antibody. Upon receipt of FDA approval, competitors would be free to market antibodies almost identical to ours, including biosimilar antibodies, thereby decreasing our market share.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extensions under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar non-U.S. legislation to extend the term of patents covering each of our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nPatents have a limited duration. The term of a U.S. patent, if granted from an application filed on or after June 8, 1995, is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patents expire, we may be open to competition from competitive medications. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned or in-\nlicensed patent rights may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nDepending upon the circumstances, the term of our owned and in-licensed patent rights that cover our product candidates may be extended in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act, by Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs, in certain countries, and by similar legislation in other countries, for delays incurred when seeking marketing approval for a drug candidate. For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within the applicable deadline, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain a patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be materially reduced. For example, we have exclusive license rights to a first U.S. patent covering the tivozanib molecule and its therapeutic use, which, inclusive of a one year interim extension granted by the USPTO, is scheduled to expire in April 2023, and a second U.S. patent covering the crystalline form of tivozanib, which is scheduled to expire in November 2023. In view of the length of time tivozanib had been under regulatory review at the FDA, a patent term extension of up to five years may be available. Although we have applied for patent term extensions on each U.S. patent, only one patent may be extended, and, when appropriate, we will have to elect which patent is to be extended. If a five-year extension were to be granted, if applied to the first patent, the term could be extended to April of 2027, and if applied to the second patent, the term could be extended to November of 2028. However, the length of the extension could be less than we request, or no extension may be granted at all.\nIn addition, SPCs have been granted for the patent covering the tivozanib molecule in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, extending the term of the patents in each of these countries up to April 2027. An SPC has been granted for the patent covering the crystalline form of tivozanib in Ireland extending the term of that patent to October 2028. The remaining pending application for an SPC on the patent covering the tivozanib molecule in Denmark may not be similarly granted, or may be granted for a shorter period than requested. If we are unable to obtain a patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period of time during which the patent rights covering tivozanib or its use can be enforced will be shortened, and our competitors may obtain approval to market a competing product sooner. As a result, our potential revenue from tivozanib could be materially reduced, causing material harm to our business.\nIssued patents covering one or more of our products could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in patent office proceedings, or in court.\nIf we or one of our strategic partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent covering one of our products, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. In addition, with respect to FOTIVDA, generic manufacturers could challenge the patents covering FOTIVDA as part of the process of obtaining regulatory approval via an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet one or more statutory requirements for patentability, including, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness, lack of written description or non-enablement. In addition, patent validity challenges may, under certain circumstances, be based upon non-statutory obviousness-type double patenting, which, if successful, could result in a finding that the claims are invalid for obviousness-type double patenting or the loss of patent term, including a patent term adjustment granted by the USPTO, if a terminal disclaimer is filed to obviate a finding of obviousness-type double patenting. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Additionally, third parties are able to challenge the validity of issued patents through administrative proceedings in the patent offices of certain countries, including the USPTO and the European Patent Office. Although we have conducted due diligence on patents we have exclusively in-licensed, and we believe that we have conducted our patent prosecution in accordance with the duty of candor and in good faith, the outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one of our products. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. Further, an intellectual property litigation could lead to unfavorable publicity that could harm our reputation and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nClaims that our platform technologies, our products or the sale or use of our products infringe the patent rights of third parties could result in costly litigation or could require substantial time and money to resolve, even if litigation is avoided.\nWe cannot guarantee that our platform technologies, our products or the use of our products, do not infringe third-party patents. Third parties might allege that we are infringing their patent rights or that we have misappropriated their trade secrets. Such third parties might resort to litigation against us. The basis of such litigation could be existing patents or patents that issue in the future.\nIt is also possible that we failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000, and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing, which is referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our products or platform technology could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform technologies, our products or the use of our products.\nWith regard to ficlatuzumab, we are aware of one United States patent and its foreign counterparts that contain broad claims related to anti-HGF antibodies having certain binding properties and their use. In the event that the owner of these patents were to bring an infringement action against us, we may have to argue that our product, its manufacture or use does not infringe a valid claim of the patent in question. Furthermore, if we were to challenge the validity of any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome a statutory presumption of validity that attaches to every United States patent. This means that, in order to prevail, we would have to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent\u2019s claims. There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity.\nIn order to avoid or settle potential claims with respect to any of the patent rights described above or any other patent rights of third parties, we may choose or be required to seek a license from a third-party and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our strategic partners were able to obtain a license, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could harm our business significantly.\nDefending against claims of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets could be costly and time-consuming, regardless of the outcome. Thus, even if we were to ultimately prevail, or to settle at an early stage, such litigation could burden us with substantial unanticipated costs. In addition, litigation or threatened litigation could result in significant demands on the time and attention of our management team, distracting them from the pursuit of other company business.\nUnfavorable outcomes in an intellectual property litigation could limit our research and development activities and/or our ability to commercialize certain products.\nIf third parties successfully assert intellectual property rights against us, we might be barred from using aspects of our technology platform, or barred from developing and commercializing related products. Prohibitions against using specified technologies, or prohibitions against commercializing specified products, could be imposed by a court or by a settlement agreement between us and a plaintiff. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in defending against allegations of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets, we may be forced to pay substantial damage awards to the plaintiff. There is inevitable uncertainty in any litigation, including intellectual property litigation. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any intellectual property litigation, even if the case against us is weak or flawed. If litigation leads to an outcome unfavorable to us, we may be required to obtain a license from the patent owner in order to continue our research and development programs or our partnerships or to market our products. It is possible that the necessary license will not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. This could limit our research and development activities, our ability to commercialize specified products, or both.\nMost of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, in-license needed technology or enter into strategic partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nIn addition, any future patent litigation, interference or other administrative proceedings will result in additional expense and distraction of our personnel. An adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings may expose us or our strategic partners to loss of our proprietary position, expose us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nTivozanib and certain of our product candidates are protected by patents exclusively licensed from other companies or institutions. If the licensors terminate the licenses or fail to maintain or enforce the underlying patents, our competitive position would be harmed and our partnerships could be terminated.\nCertain of our product candidates and out-licensing arrangements depend on patents and/or patent applications owned by other companies or institutions with which we have entered into intellectual property licenses. In particular, we hold exclusive licenses from KKC for tivozanib and from St. Vincent\u2019s for therapeutic applications that benefit from inhibition or decreased expression or activity of MIC-1, which we refer to as GDF15 and which we use in our AV-380 program. We may enter into additional license agreements as part of the development of our business in the future. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute certain patent applications which we have licensed and on which our business depends or may prosecute them in a manner not in the best interests of our business. Even if patents issue from these applications, our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may decide not to pursue litigation against third-party infringers, may fail to prove infringement or may fail to defend against counterclaims of patent invalidity or unenforceability. In addition, in spite of our best efforts, a licensor could claim that we have materially breached a license agreement and terminate the license, thereby removing our or our licensees\u2019 ability to obtain regulatory approval for and to market any product covered by such license. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended market exclusivity, competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, identical products. In addition, the partners to which we have sublicensed certain rights under these licenses, such as EUSA, would likely have grounds for terminating our partnerships if these licenses are terminated or the underlying patents are not maintained or enforced. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our competitive business position and our business prospects.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information concerning our business strategy in order to protect our competitive position. In the course of our research, development and business activities, we often rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary information. Such confidentiality agreements are used, for example, when we talk to potential strategic partners. In addition, each of our employees and consultants are required to sign a confidentiality agreement upon joining our company. We take steps to protect our proprietary information, and we seek to carefully draft our confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary interests. Nevertheless, there can be no guarantee that an employee, consultant or an outside party will not make an unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary confidential information. This might happen intentionally or inadvertently. It is possible that a competitor will make use of such information, and that our competitive position will be compromised, in spite of any legal action we might take against persons making such unauthorized disclosures.\nTrade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants or outside scientific collaborators might intentionally or inadvertently disclose our trade secret information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third-party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States sometimes are less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nOur research and development strategic partners may have rights to publish data and other information to which we have rights. In addition, we sometimes engage individuals or entities to conduct research relevant to our business. The ability of these individuals or entities to publish or otherwise publicly disclose data and other information generated during the course of their research is subject to certain contractual limitations. These contractual provisions may be insufficient or inadequate to protect our confidential information. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication, or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be jeopardized.\nWe rely significantly upon information technology, and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively and result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nWe could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of information maintained in the information systems and networks of our company. Outside parties may attempt to penetrate our systems or those of our partners or fraudulently induce our employees or employees of our partners to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data. Like other companies, we may experience threats to our data and systems, including malicious codes and computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other system failures. Any system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations, for us or our partners, could result in a material disruption of our product development programs and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and we could incur significant increases in costs to recover or reproduce the data. The risk of cyber incidents could also be increased by cyberwarfare in connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including potential proliferation of malware from the conflict into systems unrelated to the conflict. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate public disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we may incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates may be delayed.\nThe number and complexity of these security threats continue to increase over time. If a breach of our security systems or that of our partners occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose business and our reputation and credibility could be damaged. We could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair or replace information systems or networks. Although we develop and maintain systems and controls designed to prevent these events from occurring, and we have a process to identify and mitigate threats, the development and maintenance of these systems, controls and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely.\nIntellectual property rights may not address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022Others may be able to make compounds or antibodies that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u2022The term of patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may be insufficient to prevent competitors from introducing products that are competitive with our product candidates.\n\u2022If the licenses we have that relate to our product candidates are terminated by the licensors, we may be prevented from commercializing our product candidates.\n\u2022We or our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u2022We or our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions.\n\u2022Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights.\n\u2022Our pending patent applications might not lead to issued patents.\n\u2022Issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with a competitive advantage; for example, our issued patents may not be broad enough to prevent the commercialization of products competitive with one or more of our product candidates, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors.\n\u2022Our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop\ncompetitive products for sale in our or our strategic partners\u2019 existing or potential commercial markets.\n\u2022We may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\n\u2022The patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological complexity and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, several events in the last decade have increased uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future and the value of patents once obtained. Among these, in September 2011, patent reform legislation passed by Congress was signed into law in the United States. The patent law introduced changes including a first-to-file system for determining which inventors may be entitled to receive patents, and post-grant challenges, such as inter-partes review and post-grant review proceedings that allow third parties to challenge newly issued patents. The burden of proof required for challenging a patent in these proceedings is lower than in district court litigation, and patents in the biopharmaceutical industry have been successfully challenged using these new post-grant challenges. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in specified circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in specified situations. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could further weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining marketing approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates. If we or our collaborators are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to market and commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, export and import, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States, and by the EMA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third-party CROs to assist us in this process.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years, especially if additional clinical trials are required. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the various regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. It also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the relevant regulatory authority. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may delay or preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nIn addition, the FDA and comparable authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. In addition, a regulatory agency\u2019s varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. For example, in June 2013, the FDA issued the 2013 CRL informing us that it would not approve tivozanib for the first-line treatment of RCC based solely on the data from the TIVO-1 trial.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad and may limit our ability to generate revenue from product sales.\nIn order to market and sell our medicines in the EU and many other jurisdictions, we or our collaborators must obtain marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We or our collaborators may not obtain marketing approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all, and we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any particular market.\nIn many countries outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products, if approved, is also subject to approval. Obtaining non-U.S. regulatory approvals and compliance with non-U.S. regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and any future collaborators and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates in certain countries. In addition, if we or any future collaborators fail to obtain the non-U.S. approvals required to market our product candidates outside the United States or if we or any future collaborators fail to comply with applicable non-U.S. regulatory requirements, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, we could face heightened risks with respect to seeking marketing approval in the United Kingdom as a result of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. The United Kingdom is no longer part of the European Single Market and European Union Customs Union. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, became responsible for supervising medicines and medical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law, whereas Northern Ireland will continue to be subject to European Union rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended), or the HMR, as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law of the body of European Union law instruments governing medicinal products that pre-existed prior to the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, may force us to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.\nWe expect that we will be subject to additional risks in commercializing any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval outside the United States, including tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country; and workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States.\nWe are conducting, and intend in the future to conduct, clinical trials for certain of our product candidates at sites outside the United States. The FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations and the conduct of trials outside the United States could subject us to additional delays and expense.\nWe are conducting, and intend in the future to conduct, one or more of our clinical trials with trial sites that are located outside the United States. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of these data is subject to certain conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practice. The FDA must be able to validate the data from the trial through an onsite inspection if necessary. The trial population must also have a similar profile to the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful, except to the extent the disease being studied does not typically occur in the United States. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, the FDA acceptance of the data will be dependent upon its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept data from clinical trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the United States, it would likely\nresult in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of our product candidates.\nIn addition, the conduct of clinical trials outside the United States could have a significant adverse impact on us or the trial results. Risks inherent in conducting international clinical trials include:\n\u2022clinical practice patterns and standards of care that vary widely among countries;\n\u2022non-U.S. regulatory authority requirements that could restrict or limit our ability to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u2022administrative burdens of conducting clinical trials under multiple non-U.S. regulatory authority schema;\n\u2022foreign exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries.\nWe may seek certain designations for our product candidates, including Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track and Priority Review designations in the US, and PRIME Designation in the EU, but we might not receive such designations, and even if we do, such designations may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and does not increase the likelihood that product candidate will receive marketing approval.\nWe may seek certain designations for one or more of our product candidates that could expedite review and approval by the FDA. A Breakthrough Therapy product is defined as a product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For products that have been designated as Breakthrough Therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens.\nThe FDA may also designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product\u2019s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective.\nFor example, we have been granted Fast Track designation for the investigation of ficlatuzumab and cetuximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed or recurrent HNSCC. Marketing applications filed by sponsors of product candidates in Fast Track development may qualify for priority review under the policies and procedures offered by the FDA, but the Fast Track designation does not assure any such qualification or ultimate marketing approval by the FDA. Even though we have received Fast Track designation for ficlatuzumab and cetuximab, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures, and receiving a Fast Track designation does not provide assurance of ultimate FDA approval. In addition, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Further, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation at any time. As such, a Fast Track designation by the FDA, even though granted for ficlatuzumab may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and does not increase the likelihood that ficlatuzumab will receive marketing approval.\nWe may also seek a priority review designation for one or more of our product candidates. If the FDA determines that a product candidate offers major advances in treatment or provides a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, the FDA may designate the product candidate for priority review. A priority review designation means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review period of ten months.\nThese designations are within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that one of our product candidates meets the criteria for these designations, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. Further, even if we receive a designation, the receipt of such designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development or regulatory review or approval process compared to products considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualifies for these designations, the FDA may later decide that the product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nIn the EU, we may seek PRIME designation for our product candidates in the future. PRIME is a voluntary program aimed at enhancing the EMA\u2019s role to reinforce scientific and regulatory support in order to optimize development and enable accelerated assessment of new medicines that are of major public health interest with the potential to address unmet medical needs. The program focuses on medicines that target conditions for which there exists no satisfactory method of treatment in the EU or even if such a method exists, it may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments. PRIME is limited to medicines under development and not authorized in the EU and the applicant intends to apply for an initial marketing authorization application through the centralized procedure. To be accepted for PRIME, a product candidate must meet the eligibility criteria in respect of its major public health interest and therapeutic innovation based on information that is capable of substantiating the claims.\nThe benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a CHMP rapporteur to provide continued support and help to build knowledge ahead of a marketing authorization application, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review, meaning reduction in the review time for an opinion on approvability to be issued earlier in the application process. PRIME enables an applicant to request parallel EMA scientific advice and health technology assessment advice to facilitate timely market access. Even if we receive PRIME designation for any of our product candidates, the designation may not result in a materially faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional EMA procedures. Further, obtaining PRIME designation does not assure or increase the likelihood of EMA\u2019s grant of a marketing authorization.\nWe may not be able to obtain orphan drug designation or orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates, and, even if we do, that exclusivity may not prevent the FDA or the EMA from approving other competing products.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including in the United States and EU, may designate drugs and biologics for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. Generally, a product with orphan drug designation only becomes entitled to orphan drug exclusivity if it receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, in which case the FDA or the EMA will be precluded from approving another marketing application for the same product for that indication for the applicable exclusivity period. The applicable exclusivity period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the EU. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the product is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.\nWe or our collaborators may seek orphan drug designations for our product candidates and may be unable to obtain such designations. Moreover, even if we do secure such designations and orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different products can be approved for the same condition. Further, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug or biologic for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later product is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, to be more effective or to make a major contribution to patient care. Finally, orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or the EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nThe FDA may further reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act and its regulations and policies. This may be particularly true in light of a decision from the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in September 2021 finding that, for the purpose of determining the scope of exclusivity, the term \u201csame disease or condition\u201d means the designated \u201crare disease or condition\u201d and could not be interpreted by the Agency to mean the \u201cindication or use.\u201d We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.\nInadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies, including from government shut downs, or other disruptions to these agencies\u2019 operations, could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and\nstatutory, regulatory and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nSeparately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA\u2019s inability to complete required inspections for their applications. As of May 26, 2021, the FDA noted it was continuing to ensure timely reviews of applications for medical products during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in line with its user fee performance goals and conducting mission critical domestic and foreign inspections to ensure compliance of manufacturing facilities with FDA quality standards. However, the FDA may not be able to continue its current pace and review timelines could be extended, including where a pre-approval inspection or an inspection of clinical sites is required and due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions, the FDA is unable to complete such required inspections during the review period. Regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may experience delays in their regulatory activities. If a prolonged government shutdown or other disruption occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Future shutdowns or other disruptions could also affect other government agencies such as the SEC, which may also impact our business by delaying review of our public filings, to the extent such review is necessary, and our ability to access the public markets.\nFOTIVDA and any product candidate for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval are subject to ongoing regulation and could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to substantial penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements.\nFOTIVDA and any product candidate for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval in the future will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control and manufacturing, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the medicine, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. For example, FDA approval of FOTIVDA is subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which FOTIVDA may be marketed, specifically the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory advanced RCC who have progressed following two or more systemic therapies. Accordingly, we expect to continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could have the marketing approval for FOTIVDA withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our ability to market any products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe and our collaborators must also comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for FOTIVDA or any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription products are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. Thus, we are restricted from promoting any products we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved. The FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the\npromotion and advertising of prescription products may lead to investigations and enforcement actions alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022restrictions on distribution or use of a product;\n\u2022requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022recall of products;\n\u2022damage to relationships with collaborators;\n\u2022unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;\n\u2022fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022product seizure;\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u2022litigation involving patients using our products.\nSimilar restrictions apply to the approval of our products in the EU. The holder of a marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include: compliance with the EU\u2019s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, which can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations; the manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer\u2019s license is mandatory; and the marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, which are strictly regulated in the EU and are also subject to EU Member State laws. Non-compliance with EU requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties.\nOur relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which, in the event of a violation, could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of FOTIVDA and any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval in the future. Our arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse laws and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute FOTIVDA and any products for which we may obtain marketing approval in the future. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. There are also analogous state and foreign laws and regulations that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by third-party payors, including private insurers. Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and may require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to other healthcare providers and healthcare entities, or marketing expenditures. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices\nmay not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our business practices or operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above, other or future healthcare laws or case law or any governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, integrity obligations, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any such penalties could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have implemented a corporate compliance program designed to ensure that we will market and sell FOTIVDA and any future products that we successfully develop from our product candidates in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot guarantee that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Further, if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, which could impact us.\nAny relationships we may have with customers, healthcare providers and professionals and third-party payors, among others, will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to penalties, including criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, curtailment or restricting of our operations and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we are able to obtain marketing approval. Any arrangements we have with healthcare providers, third-party payors and customers will subject us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. The laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct clinical research, market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. These include the following:\nAnti-Kickback Statute. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward or in return for, either the referral of an individual for or the purchase, lease or order of a good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nFalse Claims Laws. The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties.\nHIPAA. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme or making materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Additionally, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations on covered entities and their business associates that perform certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on their behalf, including mandatory contractual terms and technical safeguards, with respect to maintaining the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\nTransparency Requirements. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or transfers of value made to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians, other healthcare providers and their immediate family members.\nAnalogous State and Foreign Laws. Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, can apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors and are generally broad and are enforced by many different federal and state agencies as well as through private actions. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that any business arrangements we have with third parties and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. Further, if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nThe provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU member states. In addition, payments made to physicians in certain EU member states must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician\u2019s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU member states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU member states. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.\nReporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental drug pricing programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any failure to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and sanctions.\nAs a condition of reimbursement by various federal and state health insurance programs, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are required to calculate and report certain pricing information to federal and state agencies. The regulations governing the calculations, price reporting and payment obligations are complex and subject to interpretation by various government and regulatory agencies, as well as the courts. We have made reasonable assumptions where there is lack of regulations or clear guidance and such assumptions involve subjective decisions and estimates. We are required to report any revisions to our calculations, price reporting and payment obligations previously reported or paid. Such revisions could affect liability to federal and state payers and also adversely impact our reported financial results of operations in the period of such restatement.\nUncertainty exists as new laws, regulations, judicial decisions or new interpretations of existing laws, or regulations related to our calculations, price reporting or payments obligations increases the chances of a legal challenge, restatement or investigation. If we become subject to investigations, restatements or other inquiries concerning compliance with price reporting laws and regulations, we could be required to pay or be subject to additional reimbursements, penalties, sanctions or fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that future healthcare reform measures could be adopted, which could result in increased pressure on pricing and reimbursement of products and thus have an adverse impact on our financial position or business operations.\nFurther, state Medicaid programs may be slow to invoice pharmaceutical companies for calculated rebates resulting in a lag between the time a sale is recorded and the time the rebate is paid. This results in a company having to carry a liability on its consolidated balance sheets for the estimate of rebate claims expected for Medicaid patients. If actual claims are higher than our current estimates, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B Program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false price information related to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties. Such failure could also be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreements, federal payments may not be available under government programs, including Medicaid or Medicare Part B, for covered outpatient drugs.\nAdditionally, if we were found to have overcharged the government in connection with the FSS program or TriCare Retail Pharmacy Program, whether due to a misstated Federal Ceiling Price or otherwise, we would be required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges could result in allegations against us under the FCA and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur collaborators are also subject to similar requirements outside of the U.S. and thus the attendant risks and uncertainties. If our collaborators suffer material and adverse effects from such risks and uncertainties, our rights and benefits for our licensed products could be negatively impacted, which could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us and any collaborators to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we, or they, may obtain.\nIn the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell FOTIVDA or any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we or any collaborators may receive for FOTIVDA or any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval in the future.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA. Since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. Further, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this case on November 10, 2020 and on June 17, 2021, dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.\nThe prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. In 2020, President Trump issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to lower prices paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. The rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final\nrule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries' access to evidence-based care.\nIn addition, in October 2020, HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023.\nAt the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for FOTIVDA or our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nFinally, outside the United States, in some nations, including those of the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control and access. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we or our collaborators may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available therapies. If reimbursement of FOTIVDA is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed.\nCompliance with global privacy and data security requirements could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit our ability to collect and process data globally, and the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to significant fines and penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe regulatory framework for the collection, use, safeguarding, sharing, transfer and other processing of information worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy frameworks with which we must comply, with additional laws and amendments being passed on a regular basis. As one example, the collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which applies to all member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data. In addition, the GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the United States and, as a result, increases the scrutiny that clinical trial sites located in the EEA should apply to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States. The GDPR also permits data protection authorities to require destruction of improperly gathered or used personal information and/or impose substantial fines for violations of the GDPR and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of personal data, including genetic, biometric or health data. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous, expensive and time-consuming process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with any EU activities.\nGiven the breadth and depth of the GDPR and changes in data protection obligations, preparing for and complying with these requirements is rigorous, expensive and time-consuming and requires significant resources and a review of our technologies, systems and practices, as well as those of any third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants that process or transfer personal data collected in the EU and otherwise across the world. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personal information from our clinical trials participants, could require us to change our business practices and put in place additional compliance mechanisms, may interrupt or delay our development, regulatory and commercialization activities and increase our cost of doing business, and could lead to government enforcement actions, private litigation and significant fines and penalties against us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSimilar actions are either in place or under way in the United States. There are a broad variety of data protection laws that are applicable to our activities, and a wide range of enforcement agencies at both the state and federal levels that can review companies for privacy and data security concerns based on general consumer protection laws. The Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general all are aggressive in reviewing privacy and data security protections for consumers. New laws also are being considered at both the state and federal levels. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act-which went into effect on January 1, 2020-is creating similar risks and obligations as those created by GDPR, though the California Consumer Privacy Act does exempt certain information collected as part of a clinical trial subject to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (the Common Rule). Many other states are considering similar legislation. Accordingly, failure to comply with federal and state laws (both those currently in effect and future legislation) regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to fines and penalties under such laws. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our reputation and our business.\nLaws and regulations governing any international operations we may have in the future may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain products outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.\nIf we expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nVarious laws, regulations and Executive Orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, marketing or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the proper disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nWe maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us and we could incur significant costs associated with environmental liability or toxic tort claims for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Potential Growth\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management, we may be unable to successfully develop our product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management, as well as others on our management team. The loss of services of employees and, in particular, of a member of management could delay or prevent our ability to successfully commercialize FOTIVDA in the United States, our ability to successfully maintain or enter into new licensing arrangements or collaborations, the successful development of our product candidates, the completion of our planned clinical trials or the attainment of regulatory approvals and successful commercialization of our product candidates. We do not carry \u201ckey person\u201d insurance covering any members of our senior management. Our employment arrangements with all of these individuals are \u201cat will,\u201d meaning they or we can terminate their service at any time.\nWe face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and other research institutions, many of which have substantially greater resources with which to reward qualified individuals than we do. We may face challenges in retaining our existing senior management and key employees and recruiting new employees to join our company as our business needs change. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our ability to recruit and build out our organization as planned. We may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals, and our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our future business plans.\nOur employees or consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and/or insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee or consultant fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees or consultants could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with federal and state health-care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, marketing, sales and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee or consultant misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation.\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee or consultant misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nIn addition, during the course of our operations, our directors, executives, employees and consultants may have access to material nonpublic information regarding our business, our results of operations or potential transactions we are considering. Despite the adoption of an Insider Trading Policy, we may not be able to prevent a director, executive, employee or consultant from trading in our common stock on the basis of, or while having access to, material nonpublic information. If a director, executive, employee or consultant was to be investigated, or an action was to be brought against a director, executive, employee or consultant for insider trading, it could have a negative impact on our reputation and our stock price. Such a claim, with or without merit, could also result in substantial expenditures of time and money and divert attention of our management team from other tasks important to the success of our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to be, highly volatile, and could fall below the price you paid. A significant decline in the value of our stock price could also result in securities class-action litigation against us.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022announcements relating to our product, FOTIVDA, including as it relates to commercial performance, sales and any future regulatory matters;\n\u2022new products, product candidates or new uses for existing products introduced or announced by our strategic partners, or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\u2022actual or anticipated results from and any delays in our manufacturing or clinical trials;\n\u2022sales of common stock by us or our stockholders in the future, as well as the overall trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on the healthcare system and the economy generally and on our supply chain, manufacturing timelines, preclinical studies, clinical trials, commercial activities and other operations specifically;\n\u2022the results of regulatory reviews and other regulatory correspondence relating to our product, product candidates or our clinical trials;\n\u2022the results of our efforts to develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products;\n\u2022disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022announcements by us of material developments in our business, financial condition, partnerships and/or operations;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures and capital commitments;\n\u2022additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022conditions or trends in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, including the recent sell off in the stock market for many companies in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in revenue, expense or earnings estimates, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts; and\n\u2022general economic and market conditions on our industry and market conditions, and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the market for biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nPeriods of volatility in the market for a company\u2019s stock are often followed by litigation against the company. For example, following our failure to obtain FDA approval for tivozanib in 2013, we and certain of our former officers and directors were involved in several legal proceedings. Following our January 2019 announcement that the FDA did not recommend we file an NDA for tivozanib at that time, several lawsuits were filed against us, our directors, and certain of our current and former officers. While the 2019 Class Action was dismissed, any litigation instituted against us in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe and our collaborators may not achieve development and commercialization goals in the estimated time frames that we publicly announce, which could have an adverse impact on our business and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe set goals and make public statements regarding our expected timing for certain accomplishments, such as statements we have made about the initiation and completion of clinical trials, filing and approval of regulatory applications and other developments and milestones under our research and development programs and those of our partners and collaborators for tivozanib, ficlatuzumab, AV-380 and AV-203. The actual timing of these events can vary significantly due to a number of factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this section \u201cPart II, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d As a result, there can be no assurance that our preclinical studies and clinical trials will advance or be completed in the time frames we expect or announce, that we will make regulatory submissions or receive regulatory approvals as planned, that we will be successful in our commercial launch or that we will be able to adhere to our currently anticipated schedule for the achievement of key milestones under any of our programs. If we fail to achieve one or more of the events described above as planned, our business could be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock could decline.\nOur management has broad discretion over our use of available cash and cash equivalents and might not spend our available cash and cash equivalents in ways that increase the value of your investment.\nOur management has broad discretion on where and how to use our cash and cash equivalents and, as a stockholder, you rely on the judgment of our management regarding the application of our available cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations. Our management might not apply our cash and cash equivalents in ways that increase the value of your investment. We expect to use a substantial portion of our cash to fund existing and future research and development of our preclinical and clinical product candidates, with the balance, if any, to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may in the future include investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, partnerships, services or technologies. Our management might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on any investment of this cash. You will not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use our cash reserves.\nIf we fail to meet the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock could be delisted from trading, which would decrease the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq. We are required to meet specified requirements to maintain our listing on Nasdaq, including a minimum market value of listed securities of $35.0 million, a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for our common stock and other continued listing requirements.\nIn the past we have, from time to time, received deficiency letters from Nasdaq as a consequence of our failure to satisfy such requirements. Although we have been able to regain compliance with the listing requirements within the manner and time periods prescribed by Nasdaq in the past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements in the future or regain compliance with respect to any future deficiencies. If we fail to satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements, we may transfer to the OTC Bulletin Board, which generally has lower financial requirements for initial listing, to avoid delisting. However, we may not be able to satisfy the initial listing requirements for the OTC Bulletin Board. Having our common stock trade on the OTC Bulletin Board could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock. Any such event could make it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common stock, and there also would likely be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. We may\nalso face other material adverse consequences in such event, such as negative publicity, a decreased ability to obtain additional financing, diminished investor and/or employee confidence and the loss of business development opportunities, some or all of which may contribute to a further decline in our stock price.\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. Some of the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate on a period-to-period basis include:\n\u2022the level of net product revenues from the sales of FOTIVDA;\n\u2022the level of expenses incurred to commercialize FOTIVDA;\n\u2022the level of expenses incurred in connection with our clinical development programs, including development and manufacturing costs relating to our clinical development candidates;\n\u2022the implementation of restructuring and cost-savings strategies;\n\u2022the implementation or termination of collaboration, licensing, manufacturing or other material agreements with third parties, and non-recurring revenue or expenses under any such agreement;\n\u2022costs associated with litigation in which we may become involved;\n\u2022changes in our 2020 Loan Facility, including the existence of any event of default that may accelerate then remaining principal payments and fees due thereunder;\n\u2022non-cash changes in fair value related to re-valuations of our outstanding warrant liability as a result of fluctuations in our stock price; and\n\u2022compliance with regulatory requirements.\nPeriod-to-period comparisons of our historical and future financial results may not be meaningful, and investors should not rely on them as an indication of future performance. Our fluctuating results may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. Our failure to meet these expectations may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock price.\nGlobal credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions since 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the government measures taken in response to the pandemic. We expect that rapid or extended periods of deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will continue. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by external economic conditions and a volatile business environment or unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the equity and credit markets are not favorable at any time we seek to raise capital, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon clinical development plans. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers or other partners may not survive economically turbulent times, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $87.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities consisting of cash on deposit with banks and in a U.S. government money market fund, and high-grade debt securities, including commercial paper. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any downgrades, material losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or marketable securities. However, no assurance can be given that deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities or our ability to meet our financing objectives. Dislocations in the credit market may adversely impact the value and/or liquidity of cash equivalents and marketable securities owned by us.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of currently outstanding options, could negatively affect our stock price.\nA substantial portion of our outstanding common stock can be traded without restriction at any time. Some of these shares are currently restricted as a result of securities laws, but will be able to be sold, subject to any applicable\nvolume limitations under federal securities laws with respect to affiliate sales, in the near future. As such, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell such shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, we have a significant number of shares that are subject to outstanding options. The exercise of these options and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock could cause a further decline in our stock price. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us, or provide favorable coverage. A lack of research coverage may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. To the extent we do have analyst coverage, if one or more analysts downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price would likely decline. In addition, if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws or Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest. These provisions include:\n\u2022advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our by-laws; and\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a rights plan, or a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that a stockholder could receive a premium for shares of our common stock held by a stockholder in an acquisition.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\nProxy contests have been waged against companies in the biopharmaceutical industry over the last few years. If faced with a proxy contest, we may not be able to successfully respond to the contest, which would be disruptive to our business. Even if we are successful, our business could be adversely affected by a proxy contest because:\n\u2022responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders may be costly and time-consuming, and may disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees;\n\u2022perceived uncertainties as to the potential outcome of any proxy contest may result in our inability to consummate potential acquisitions, collaborations or in-licensing opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and\n\u2022if individuals that have a specific agenda different from that of our management or other members of our board of directors are elected to our board of directors as a result of any proxy contest, such an election may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce accurate financial statements and on our stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us, on an annual basis, to review and evaluate our internal controls. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm has attested to the effectiveness of our internal controls. Despite our efforts, we can provide no assurance as to our, or our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s, conclusions with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. There is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nIf we are unable to successfully remediate any material weaknesses in our internal control, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price may decline as a result. We also could become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nOur stockholders should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our existing operations. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends is currently prohibited by the terms of our debt financing arrangements and any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. In addition, the terms of the 2020 Loan Facility preclude, and any future debt agreements may preclude us from, paying dividends. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment. As a result, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nChanges in tax laws or in their implementation or interpretation may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. In recent years, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. For example, the TCJA was enacted in 2017 and significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. In addition, as part of Congress\u2019 response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, or FFCR Act, was enacted on March 18, 2020, and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, was enacted on March 27, 2020. Both contain numerous tax provisions.\nRegulatory guidance under the TCJA, the FFCR Act and the CARES Act is and continues to be forthcoming, and such guidance could ultimately increase or lessen impact of these laws on our business and financial condition. It is also possible that Congress will enact additional legislation in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which could have an impact on our company. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the TCJA, the FFCR Act or the CARES Act. We urge investors to consult with their legal and tax advisers regarding the implications of the TCJA, the FFCR Act and the CARES Act and other changes in tax laws on an investment in our common stock. Recent changes in tax law may adversely affect our business or financial condition.\nWe might not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $613.1 million, of which $502.6 million will, if not used, expire at various dates through 2037, and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $12.6 million, which will, if not used, expire at various dates through 2041. To the extent that they expire unused, these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will not be available to offset our future income tax liabilities. Federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such carryforwards is limited to 80% of our taxable income in the year in which such carryforwards are used. As of December 31, 2021, we have recorded a full valuation allowance to offset these deferred tax assets because the future realizability of such assets is uncertain.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Code and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss and credit carryforwards to reduce its tax liability for post-change periods may be limited. We have not determined if we have experienced Section 382 ownership changes in the past and if a portion of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. We also may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. In addition, we have not conducted a detailed study to document whether our historical activities qualify to support the research and development credits currently claimed as a carryforward. A detailed study could result in adjustment to our research and development credit carryforwards. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our historical net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is materially limited, or if our research and development carryforwards are adjusted, our use of those attributes to offset future income tax liabilities would be limited.", "PERMNO": 93301, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AVEO"}
