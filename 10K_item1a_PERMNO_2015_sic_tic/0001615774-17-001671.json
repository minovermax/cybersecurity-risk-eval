{"cik": "724571", "company": "FREDS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors are encouraged to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this document when considering an investment decision with respect to Fred's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management, or that management currently deems immaterial, may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that instance, the trading price of Fred's securities could decline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment.\nCompetitive and Strategic Risks\nWe operate in a competitive industry.\nThe retail pharmacy and discount retail industries in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete with respect to price, store location, in-stock consistency, merchandise quality, assortment and presentation, and customer service with many national, regional and local retailing establishments, including drug stores, independent pharmacies, department stores, discount stores, variety stores, dollar stores, discount clothing stores, grocery stores, outlet stores, convenience stores, warehouse stores and other stores. Our competitors range from smaller, growing companies to considerably larger retail businesses that have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. This competitive environment subjects us to various risks, including the ability to continue to provide competitively priced products to our customers that will allow us to maintain profitability and continue store growth. Some of our competitors utilize aggressive promotional activities, advertising programs, and pricing discounts and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not respond effectively to these efforts.\nOur plans depend significantly on strategies and initiatives designed to increase sales and improve the efficiencies, costs and effectiveness of our operations. Failure to achieve or sustain these plans could affect the Company\u2019s performance adversely.\nWe have strategies and initiatives (such as those relating to technology, inventory management, merchandising, pharmaceutical and front store product expansion, sourcing, shrink, private brand, distribution and transportation, store operations, store formats, budgeting and expense reduction, and real estate) in various stages of testing, evaluation, and implementation, upon which we expect to rely to continue to improve our results of operations and financial condition and to achieve our financial plans. These initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain, even when tested successfully, in their application to our business in general. It is possible that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation, particularly in light of the decentralized nature of our field management. General implementation also may be negatively affected by other risk factors described herein. Successful system-wide implementation relies on consistency of training, stability of workforce, ease of execution, and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely. Failure to achieve successful implementation of our initiatives, or the cost of these initiatives exceeding management\u2019s estimates, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of our merchandising initiatives, particularly those with respect to non-consumable merchandise such as pharmaceutical products, as well as store-specific allocations such as those made to Xpress stores, depends in part upon our ability to predict consistently and successfully the products that our customers will demand and to identify and timely respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences, expectations and needs. If we are unable to select products that are attractive to customers, in amounts that customers are likely to buy products, to timely obtain such products at costs that allow us to sell them at an acceptable profit, or to effectively market such products, then our sales, market share and profitability could be adversely affected. Further, if our merchandising efforts in the areas of general pharmaceutical products and higher margin consumables are unsuccessful, it could be further adversely affected by our inability to offset the lower margins associated with the Company\u2019s other lines of business, such as specialty pharmaceutical products.\nWe depend on successfully increasing the utilization of our existing stores as well as our new store opening program, including increasing our pharmacy department presence in new and existing stores, for a portion of our growth.\nOur growth is dependent on both increases in sales in existing stores and the ability to open new stores with pharmacy departments. Unavailability of store locations that we deem desirable, delays in the acquisition of pharmacies or opening of new stores, difficulties in staffing and operating new store locations and the lack of customer acceptance of stores in expanded market areas all may negatively impact our new store growth, the costs associated with new stores and/or the profitability of new stores. Our ability to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms could affect costs of operations or slow store expansions.\nUse of a single supplier of pharmaceutical products and our ability to negotiate satisfactory terms could adversely affect our business.\nWe have a long-term supply contract from a single supplier, Cardinal Health, for our pharmaceutical operations. Any significant disruption in our relationship with this supplier, deterioration in their financial condition, changes in terms, supplier increases in pharmaceutical costs or an industry-wide change in wholesale business practices, including those of our supplier or the manufacturers with whom our supplier transacts business, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n- 11 -\nWe could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs.\nNew brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales, but relatively higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced, or delays in their introduction, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. Any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections.\nWe derive a significant portion of our sales from prescription drug sales reimbursed by pharmacy benefit management companies.\nWe derive a significant portion of our sales from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by pharmacy benefit management (\u201cPBM\u201d) companies. PBM companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. There can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular PBM company\u2019s pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period. If our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large PBM companies is restricted or terminated, we expect that our sales would be adversely affected, at least in the short-term. If we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. If we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace, or that all clients of the PBM company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans, initially or at all. In addition, in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally.\nIt is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace Average Wholesale Price (\u201cAWP\u201d) or Wholesale Acquisition Cost (\u201cWAC\u201d), which are the pricing references used for many of our PBM contracts, pharmaceutical purchase agreements, retail network contracts, specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments. In addition, many state Medicaid fee-for-service programs (\u201cFFS Medicaid\u201d) may be required to establish pharmacy network payments on the basis of Actual Acquisition Cost (\u201cAAC\u201d). This move to an AAC basis in FFS Medicaid could have an impact in reimbursement practices in other commercial and government segments. Future changes to the use of AWP, WAC or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs and/or other payors, could impact the reimbursement we receive from Medicare and Medicaid programs, the reimbursement we receive from PBM clients and other payors and/or our ability to negotiate rebates and/or discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, PBMs and retail pharmacies. A failure or inability to fully offset any increased prices or costs or to modify our operations to mitigate the impact of such increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections. The effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time.\nOur ability to achieve the results of store closures under our strategic plan initiatives could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our continuing operations, we perform research and analysis to identify underperforming stores and to determine if store closure is necessary. For example, in fiscal 2016 the decision was made to close approximately 40 underperforming stores in fiscal 2017, for which we could no longer foresee a path to profitability. The estimated costs and charges associated with these and future store closures may vary materially and adversely based upon various factors, including the timing of execution, the outcome of negotiations with landlords and other third parties, or unexpected costs, any of which could result in our not realizing the anticipated benefits from the strategic plan.\nOur private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks.\nIn addition to brand name products, we offer our customers private brand products that are not available from other retailers. We seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy, including through the expanded offerings of brands we own or license on an exclusive basis, as well as through selective acquisitions. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers, as well as the timely development and introduction of new products, is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty. Although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers and typically provide us with higher gross margins than comparable national brand products we sell, the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks, such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. An increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors\u2019 products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business operations, results of operations and financial condition.\n- 12 -\nOperational Risks\nOur business is somewhat seasonal.\nWe typically realize a significant portion of our net sales during the holiday selling season in the first and fourth quarters in addition to the heavier sales volume we experience around the first day of each calendar month. Our inventories and short-term borrowings, if required, increase in anticipation of this holiday season. A seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could occur if, for any reason, our net sales during the holiday selling season were to fall below seasonal norms. If for any reason our first and fourth quarter results were substantially below expectations, our profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns, especially in seasonal merchandise.\nNatural disasters or unusually adverse weather conditions could affect our business.\nUnusually adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or similar disruptions, could significantly reduce our net sales. In addition, these disruptions could also adversely affect our supply chain efficiency and make it more difficult for us to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from suppliers. A number of our stores are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes and tornadoes and other adverse weather conditions.\nOperational difficulties could disrupt our business.\nOur stores are managed through a network of geographically dispersed management personnel. Our inability to effectively and efficiently operate our stores, including the ability to control losses resulting from inventory shrinkage, may negatively impact our sales and/or margin. In addition, we rely upon our distribution and logistics network to provide goods to stores in a timely and cost-effective manner; any disruption, unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process such as a decrease in the capacity of carriers and strikes could negatively impact the timely receipt of merchandise and increase transportation costs disrupting our store operations. Our operation depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business. We rely on certain software vendors to maintain and upgrade these systems as needed. We rely on telecommunications carriers to gather and disseminate our operations information. The disruption or failure of these systems or carriers could negatively impact our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nMerchandise supply and pricing and the interruption of and dependence on imports could adversely affect our business.\nWe have maintained good relations with our vendors and believe that we are generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors. We purchase a portion of our inventory from foreign suppliers, principally in China. As a result, political instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from other countries or the imposition of additional regulations relating to duties on imports could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs. Also, our cost of goods is affected by the fluctuation of local currencies against the dollar in countries where these goods are produced. Accordingly, changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold and, if we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers, decrease our gross margins and ultimately our earnings. We purchase a significant amount of goods from Cardinal Health, Procter and Gamble and several large domestic and import vendors and any disruption in that supply and or pricing of such merchandise could negatively impact our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in consumer demand and product mix and changes in overall economic conditions could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demands and preferences for product mix. A general slowdown in the United States economy, rising personal debt levels, rising foreclosure rates, rising fuel prices, or changes in government aid, social security, and other means that many of our customers rely upon may adversely affect the spending of our consumers, which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, changes in the types of products available for sale and the selection of products by our customers affect sales, product mix and margins. Future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, business conditions, fuel and energy costs, inflation, interest rates, and tax rates, could also adversely affect our business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products. We might be unable to anticipate these buying patterns and implement appropriate inventory strategies, which would adversely affect our sales and gross profit performance. In addition, increases in fuel and energy costs would increase our transportation costs and overall cost of doing business and could adversely affect our financial statements as a whole.\n- 13 -\nDelays in openings and costs of operating new stores and distribution facilities could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe maintain two distribution facilities, and plan on constructing new facilities as needed to support our growth. One of our key business strategies is to expand our base of retail stores. We plan to expand and refresh our network of stores through new store openings and by remodeling existing stores each year. Delays in opening, refreshing or remodeling stores or delays in opening distribution facilities to service those new stores could adversely affect our future operations by slowing growth, which may in turn reduce revenue and margin growth. Adverse changes in the cost to operate distribution facilities and stores, such as changes in labor, utilities, fuel and transportation, and other operating costs, could have an adverse impact on us.\nChanges in our ability to attract and retain employees, and changes in health care and other insurance costs could adversely affect our business.\nOur growth could be adversely impacted by our inability to attract and retain employees at the store operations level, in distribution facilities, and at the corporate level, including our senior management team. The retail industry has a high turnover rate; therefore, there is a continuous need to recruit and train new store managers and employees. Our failure to retain or successfully replace key personnel at the corporate level may have an adverse effect on our business. Other factors that impact our ability to maintain sufficient levels of qualified employees in all areas of the business include, but are not limited to, our reputation, employee morale, the current macroeconomic environment, competition from other employers, and our ability to offer adequate compensation packages. Adverse changes in health care costs could also adversely impact our ability to achieve our operational and financial goals and to offer attractive benefit programs to our employees.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, gift cards and mobile payment technologies, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements and related interpretations may change over time, which could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements, or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired. In addition, our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which could result in higher costs and/or reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nA significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process customer transactions and record results. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and natural disasters. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customer, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt of personal information about our customers. If we experience a data security breach, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions, credit card brand assessments and fines and private litigation. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could cause them to discontinue usage of credit cards in our stores, decline to use our pharmacy department services, or stop shopping at our stores altogether. Such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations.\nCyber-attacks could affect our business\nIf our information technology (\"IT\") systems are breached due to a cyber-attack, we could experience a material disruption to our IT systems as well as data loss that could have an adverse effect on our business. We could experience operational delays due to the disruption of our IT systems. Future results could be negatively impacted by data theft, destruction or loss, or unplanned release of confidential information. In addition to the operational and data losses we could experience from a cyber-attack, the Company's reputation with our customers, vendors or other third-party affiliates could be damaged.\n- 14 -\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe are subject to a broad and complex regulatory framework and may be unable to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable government regulation may result in fines and/or penalties, a loss of licensure, registration, and approval or other government enforcement action.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, during the past several years, the United States health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and enforcement activity at both the federal and state levels. Further, uncertainties exist regarding the application of many of these legal requirements to our business. In addition, it is possible that all, or certain provision of the current health care reform legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated. Changes in these laws and regulations and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business, including, but not limited to: imposition of civil or criminal penalties; significant fines or monetary penalties; suspension or disgorgement of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications or approvals; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; or loss of registrations or licensure.\nThe regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: the laws and regulations described in the Government Regulation section of Item 1 of this Form 10-K; accounting standards; financial disclosure; securities laws and regulations; federal and state laws and regulations relating to our employees, including those relating to wages, benefits or workplace requirements; federal laws relating to trade, including tariffs and quotas; federal anti-trust laws; tax laws and regulations and their possible reform; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous materials and wastes; and laws and regulations of the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the sale, advertisement and promotion of products that we sell, such as state boards of pharmacy. The Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), DEA and various states regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various states\u2019 controlled substances acts and their accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend our registrations and licenses, seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also subject to the terms of various government agreements and mandates, including those described in the Government Regulation section. In that regard, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by existing and new government legislative, regulatory action and enforcement activity, including, without limitation, any one or more of the following:\n\u00b7 federal and state laws and regulations concerning the submission of claims for reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs;\n\u00b7 federal and state laws and regulations governing the purchase, distribution, tracking, management, compounding, dispensing and reimbursement of prescription drugs and related services, and applicable registration or licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 heighted enforcement of controlled substances regulations;\n\u00b7 the effect of the expiration of patents covering brand name drugs and the introduction of generic products;\n\u00b7 the frequency and rate of approvals by the FDA of new brand name and generic drugs, or of over-the-counter status for brand name drugs;\n\u00b7 rules and regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA and the HITECH Act; and other federal and state laws affecting the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of health or other personal information, such as federal laws on information privacy precipitated by concerns about information collection through the Internet, state security breach laws and state laws limiting the use and disclosure of prescriber information;\n- 15 -\n\u00b7 health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 consumer protection laws affecting our health care services, the products we sell, the informational calls we make and/or the marketing of our goods and services;\n\u00b7 federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business, including the management of hazardous substances, storage and transportation of hazardous materials, and various recordkeeping disclosure and procedure requirements promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that may apply to our operations;\n\u00b7 health care reform, managed care reform and plan design legislation;\n\u00b7 laws against the corporate practice of medicine;\n\u00b7 government regulation of the development, administration, review and updating of formularies and drug lists including requirements and/or limitations around formulary tiering and patient cost sharing;\n\u00b7 drug pricing legislation, including \u201cmost favored nation\u201d pricing;\n\u00b7 federal and state laws and regulations establishing or changing prompt payment requirements for payments to retail pharmacies;\n\u00b7 impact of network access legislation or regulations, including \u201cany willing provider\u201d laws, on our ability to manage pharmacy networks;\n\u00b7 ERISA and related regulations;\n\u00b7 administration of Medicare Part D, including legislative changes and/or CMS rulemaking and interpretation;\n\u00b7 Medicare and Medicaid regulations applicable to our business;\n\u00b7 ongoing compliance with consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, corrective action plans and other agreements with government agencies;\n\u00b7 insurance licensing and other insurance regulatory requirements applicable to offering Medicare Part D programs and services or other health care services; and direct regulation of pharmacies by regulatory and quasi-regulatory bodies.\nAdverse impacts associated with legal proceedings and claims could affect our business.\nWe operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the course of our businesses, including those contained in Note 10, Other Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities and class action litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. In addition, under the qui tam or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of \u201cfalse\u201d claims to federal and/or state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. From time to time, we may also be involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims.\nDespite our best efforts to ensure the quality and safety of the products we sell, we may be subject to product liability claims from customers or penalties from government agencies relating to products, including food products that are recalled, defective or otherwise alleged to be harmful. Such claims may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling and transportation of products the Company sells. All of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product and food safety laws. We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers. However, if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturers' lack of understanding of U.S. product liability or other laws, which may make it more likely that we be required to respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, such claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products. Our litigation expenses could increase as well, which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations, even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.\n- 16 -\nIncreases in our insurance-related costs could significantly affect our business.\nThe costs of many types of insurance and self-insurance, especially workers\u2019 compensation and employee health care, have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, economic conditions, terrorism and heightened scrutiny of insurance brokers and insurance providers. Our pharmacy departments are also exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, including with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions and adequacy of warnings, and are significantly dependent upon suppliers to provide safe, government-approved and non-counterfeit products. We also sell a variety of products that we purchase from a large number of suppliers, including some who operate in foreign countries, which could become subject to contamination, product tampering, mislabeling or other damage. While we maintain reasonable quality assurance practices, no program can provide complete assurance that a product liability issue will not arise. Should a product liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs may not be adequate to protect us against future claims. In addition, we may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. Damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability issue could have an adverse effect on our business. If our insurance-related costs increase significantly, or we are unable to renew our insurance policies or protect against all the business risks facing us, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn 2010, Congress passed PPACA, which continues to result in significant structural changes to the health insurance system. Many of these changes were implemented prior to the end of fiscal 2014, and several of the resulting regulations and sub-regulatory guidance have yet to be issued and/or finalized. As a result, uncertainties exist regarding the full impact of PPACA on our business. While the reforms affected the healthcare coverage and plans of Fred's employees as well as our pharmacy department customers, overall, our benefit plan designs already met the affordable and minimum coverage standards PPACA required. We cannot predict what, if any, further effect the PPACA may have on our pharmacy department business, insurance costs or labor. We also cannot predict other legislative or market-driven changes within the health care system that could affect our business.\n- 17 -\nIn January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In March 2017, following the passage of the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation known as the American Health Care Act, which, if enacted, would have amended or repealed significant portions of the PPACA. However, consensus over the scope and content of the American Health Care Act could not be reached by its proponents in the U.S. House of Representatives. Thus, the proposed legislation has been withdrawn and the prospects for legislative action on this bill are uncertain. Congress could consider other legislation to repeal or replace certain elements of the PPACA. At this time, we continue to evaluate what effect, if any, the PPACA\u2019s possible repeal and replacement may have on our business.\nTax assessments and unclaimed property audits by governmental authorities could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe remit a variety of taxes and fees to various governmental authorities, including federal and state income taxes, excise taxes, property taxes, sales and use taxes and payroll taxes. The taxes and fees remitted by us are subject to review and audit by the applicable governmental authorities which could result in liability for additional assessments. In addition, we are subject to unclaimed property (escheat) laws which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time. We may be subject to audit by individual U.S. states with regard to our escheatment practices. The legislation and regulations related to tax and unclaimed property matters tend to be complex and subject to varying interpretations by both government authorities and taxpayers. Although management believes that the positions we have taken are reasonable, various taxing authorities may challenge certain of the positions we have taken, which may also potentially result in additional liabilities for taxes, unclaimed property, interest and penalties in excess of accrued liabilities. Our positions are reviewed as events occur such as the availability of new information, the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, the conclusion of tax audits, the measurement of additional estimated liabilities based on current calculations, the identification of new tax contingencies or the rendering of relevant court decisions. An unfavorable resolution of assessments by a governmental authority could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nFinancial and Economic Risks\nCurrent economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nThe United States economy is continuing to feel the impact of the economic downturn that began in late 2007, and the future economic environment may not fully recover to levels prior to the downturn. This economic uncertainty has and could further lead to reduced consumer spending. If consumer spending decreases or does not grow, we may not be able to sustain or grow sales. In addition, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on our gross profit. We operate a number of stores in areas that are experiencing a lower or slower recovery than the economy on a national level. A continued softening or slow recovery in consumer spending may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Reduced revenues as a result of decreased consumer spending may also reduce our liquidity and otherwise hinder our ability to implement our long term strategy.\nChanges in third-party reimbursements, including government programs, could adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our sales are funded by federal and state governments and private insurance plans. For the years ended January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, pharmaceutical sales were 51.4% and 50.2% of total sales, respectively. The healthcare industry is experiencing a trend toward cost-containment with governments and private insurance plans seeking to impose lower reimbursements and utilization restrictions while also moving to a more outcomes based payment model. Payments made under such programs may not remain at levels comparable to present levels or be sufficient to cover our cost. Private insurance plans may base their reimbursement rates on government rates. Accordingly, reimbursements may be limited or reduced, thereby adversely affecting our revenues and cash flows. Also, access to existing and/or new patients may be hindered or prevented through the implementation of preferred or restricted pharmacy provider networks ultimately impacting the financial results of the pharmacy department. Additionally, and in light of the current macroeconomic environment and recent healthcare legislation such as the PPACA, which includes provisions that are specific to our pharmacy department, government or private insurance plans may adjust scheduled reimbursement payments to us in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial condition.\nOur ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by volatility in the capital markets.\nWe obtain and manage liquidity from cash flows we generate from our operating activities as well as our access to capital markets, including our credit facilities. Changes in the macroeconomic environment could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed. Contraction in the credit markets, volatility and low liquidity in the capital markets could result in reduced availability of credit and a higher cost of borrowing, making it more difficult to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to the Company.\n- 18 -\nMerger and Acquisition Related Risk\nCompletion of the proposed acquisition of divested Rite Aid assets is subject to the satisfaction of numerous conditions, and the proposed acquisition may not be completed on the proposed terms, within the expected timeframe, or at all.\nOur ability to consummate the proposed acquisition of divested Rite Aid assets remains subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, the following: (i) our receipt of preliminary approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) as a purchaser of the divested assets, (ii) the closing of the proposed acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens, (iii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in the asset purchase agreement, (iv) the performance of covenants, (v) filings with or the receipt of regulatory approvals from certain state boards of pharmacy, and (vi) the absence of a material adverse effect.\nThere is no assurance that all of the conditions will be satisfied, or that the proposed acquisition will be completed on the proposed terms, within the expected timeframe, or at all. Any delay in completing the proposed acquisition could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the proposed acquisition is successfully completed within its expected timeframe. Further, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the proposed acquisition will be satisfied or waived, or that the proposed acquisition will be completed at all.\nIf the proposed acquisition is not completed for any reason, we will have incurred expenses related to the acquisition, devoted company resources without realizing the expected benefits of the proposed acquisition, and may receive negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, vendors and employees. This could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and financial condition.\nIn order to complete the proposed acquisition of divested Rite Aid assets, we must make certain governmental filings and obtain certain governmental authorizations, and if such filings and authorizations are not made or granted or are granted with conditions, completion of the proposed acquisition may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition could be reduced.\nWe have agreed in the asset purchase agreement to (i) use our reasonable best efforts to obtain all authorizations and approvals from governmental authorities, (ii) prepare and furnish all necessary information and documents reasonably requested by the FTC, (iii) use reasonable best efforts to demonstrate to the FTC that we are an acceptable purchaser of, and will compete effectively using, the divested assets, and (iv) reasonably cooperate with Walgreens and Rite Aid in obtaining all FTC approvals. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy these obligations or obtain the authorizations and approvals necessary to complete the proposed acquisition. There can be no assurance that the FTC will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the proposed acquisition or imposing additional material costs on us, or otherwise adversely affecting our business and results of operations after completion of the proposed acquisition. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the proposed acquisition by us, Walgreens or Rite Aid.\nIf we are able to complete the proposed acquisition of divested Rite Aid assets, the anticipated benefits, synergies and cost savings of the proposed acquisition may not be realized as quickly or as fully as anticipated, or at all.\nThe success of the proposed acquisition, including anticipated benefits, synergies and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of our Company and the assets to be acquired. Such integration requires significant efforts and will result in the Company incurring non-recurring costs, including legal, accounting and advisory fees. If financial projections related to the acquisition are not realized, or if the integration of the acquired assets proves to be more difficult than expected, the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may be delayed.\nWe expect to finance the proposed acquisition of divested Rite Aid assets with debt.\nTo finance the proposed acquisition, we expect to incur debt consisting of a $1.2 billion senior secured asset-based loan facility and a $450 million secured term loan. The agreements that will govern our indebtedness will include restrictions on our operations or our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing, and will impact our ability to obtain additional capital, which may adversely affect our stock price. Incurring additional debt beyond the indebtedness needed to complete the proposed acquisition could create additional risk. Additionally, our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations will depend on our financial condition and operating performance, which will be subject to prevailing financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control.\n- 19 -\nStock Ownership Risk\nChanges to current dividend payments could adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nOur ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the success of our operations and the management of our cash flows. We cannot provide assurance that the Company will continue to pay dividends at our current levels. If we fail to maintain dividends at the current levels, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 77420, "SIC": 5331, "TIC": "FREDQ"}
