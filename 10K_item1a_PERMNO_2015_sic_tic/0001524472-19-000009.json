RISK FACTORS\nIn evaluating our business, each of the following risks should be carefully considered, along with all of the other information in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC. Should any of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties we face and therefore may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business, economic and geopolitical environment and as a result new risk factors may emerge from time to time. We can neither predict with certainty these new risk factors nor assess the extent to which any new factor, or combination of factors, may adversely impact our business or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Operational and External Factors\nFailure to compete successfully in our markets and disruptive technologies could adversely affect our business.\nWe offer our products and services in competitive markets. We believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product and service performance, quality and reliability, innovation, speed to market with new or disruptive technologies, application expertise, brand reputation, energy efficiency, product life cycle cost, timeliness of delivery, proximity of service centers, effectiveness of our distribution channels and price. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require successful management of these factors, including continued investment by us in manufacturing, technology and innovation, research and development, engineering, marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, services and business models and defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors including many new and non-traditional competitors, (iii) enhance our products and services offerings by adding innovative features or disruptive technologies that differentiate them from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products and services to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers\u2019 needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products and services.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors or third parties from outside of our industry may develop disruptive technologies or products and services that are superior to ours, may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new or disruptive technologies or evolving customer requirements. The failure of our technologies, products or services to maintain and gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings could significantly reduce our revenues or market share and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive, which could adversely affect our market share and financial performance. Failure to continue competing successfully or to win large contracts could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global economic and financial market conditions.\nWe compete around the world in various geographic and product markets. In 2018, 47%, 25% and 20% of our total revenue was from customers located in the United States, western Europe and emerging markets, respectively. We expect revenue from these markets to be significant for the foreseeable future. Important factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of these economies and our customers\u2019 confidence in both local and global macro-economic conditions; industrial and private sector spending, federal, state, local and municipal governmental fiscal and trade policies; the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets; interest rates; availability of commercial financing for our customers and end-users; the availability of funding for our public sector customers; and unemployment rates. A slowdown or prolonged downturn in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business.\nIn 2018, 53% of our total revenue was from customers outside the United States, with 20% of total revenue generated in emerging markets. We expect our sales from international operations and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue. We have placed a particular emphasis on increasing our growth and presence in emerging markets. Many of our manufacturing operations, employees and suppliers are located\noutside of the United States. Both our international operations and sales are subject, in varying degrees, to risks inherent in doing business outside the United States. These risks include the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in trade protection measures, including embargoes, tariffs and other trade barriers, and import and export regulations and licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ninstability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, such as economic nationalism, populism, protectionism and anti-global sentiment;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws and potential negative consequences from the interpretation, application and enforcement by governmental tax authorities of tax laws and policies;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in other laws and regulations or in how such provisions are interpreted or administered;\n\u2022\npotential disruptions in our global supply chain;\n\u2022\npossibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, including those related to infrastructure and data transmission, security and privacy;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;\n\u2022\ndisruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;\n\u2022\nregional safety and security considerations;\n\u2022\nincreased costs and risks in developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a number of global operations as a result of distance as well as language and cultural differences; and\n\u2022\noutbreak or escalation of insurrection, armed conflict, terrorism or war.\nChanges in the geopolitical or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For example, changes in U.S. policy regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, could also negatively impact our business. In 2018, the U.S. imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from China and certain other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs imposed by the U.S. on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we may not be able to offset or may otherwise adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we continue to monitor Brexit and its potential impacts on our results of operations and financial condition. Volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the United Kingdom executes its exit from the European Union. If the United Kingdom's membership in the European Union terminates without an agreement (referred to as a \u201chard Brexit\u201d), there could be increased costs from re-imposition of tariffs on trade between the United Kingdom and European Union, increased transportation costs, shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures and shortages of certain goods. The United Kingdom will also need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world, which could take years to complete. In the case of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, our exposure to disruptions to our supply chain, increased costs, the imposition of tariffs and currency devaluation in the United Kingdom could result in a material impact to our consolidated revenue, earnings and cash flow.\nFurther, any payment of distributions, loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on, or taxation of, dividends on repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. In addition to the general risks that we face outside the United States, our operations in emerging markets could involve additional uncertainties for us, including risks that governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us, or the amount of any such taxes may increase; governments may seek to nationalize our assets; or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business. In addition, emerging markets pose other uncertainties, including the difficulty of enforcing agreements, challenges collecting receivables, protection of our intellectual property and other assets, pressure on the pricing of our products and services, higher business conduct risks, ability to hire and retain qualified talent and risks of political instability. We cannot predict the impact such events might have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by cyber threats or other interruptions in information technology, communications networks and operations.\nOur business operations rely on information technology and communications networks, including those operated by third parties, to process, transmit and store our electronic information or our customers\u2019 electronic information, and manage or support a variety of business processes or activities. Regardless of protection measures, essentially all systems are susceptible to disruption due to cybersecurity attacks including denial-of-service, computer viruses and security breaches, insider risk, equipment or system failure, vandalism, natural disasters, power outages, shutdown, telecommunication or utility failure and other events. In addition, we have designed products and services that connect to and are part of the \u201cInternet of Things.\u201d While we attempt to provide adequate security measures to safeguard our products from cyber threats, the potential for an attack remains. A successful attack may result in inappropriate access to our or our customers' information or an inability for our products and services to function properly.\nWe, and some of our third party vendors, have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience them in the future, likely with more frequency and involving a broader range of devices. To date, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations. We have adopted measures designed to mitigate potential risks associated with information technology disruptions and cybersecurity threats, however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromise of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, liability to others, regulatory enforcement actions, and/or damage to our reputation. We also have or operate through a concentration of operations on certain sites, such as production and shared services centers, where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs. Transport of goods from suppliers and to customers could also be hampered for the reasons stated above. Disruption to any of the information technology and communications networks on which we rely, or an attack on our IoT products and services, could interfere with our operations, disrupt service to our customers, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer relationships and negatively impact our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nAlthough we continue to assess these risks, implement controls and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning, we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur.\nA material disruption to any of our facilities or operations, or that of third parties upon which we rely, may adversely affect our business.\nIf our facilities or operations, or that of third parties upon which we rely in our supply chain and critical business operations, were to be disrupted as a result of a significant equipment or system failure, natural disaster, power, water or communications outage, fire, explosion, critical supply failure, terrorism, cyber-based attack, political disruption, labor dispute, work stoppage or slowdown, adverse weather conditions or other reason, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Interruptions could cause an inability to meet customer demand, increase our costs, reduce our sales, and impact our business processes and activities. We also have or operate through a concentration of operations on certain sites, such as production and shared services centers, where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs. Any interruption in capability may be lengthy and have lasting effects, require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, and require us to make substantial expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition. Any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring and transformation plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business.\nIn recent fiscal years, we have initiated restructuring, realignment and transformation plans in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness. In 2017, we undertook steps to advance a multi-year effort to transform many of our support functions and related technologies, including Finance, Human Resources and Procurement. We may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring and transformation plans. Implementing planned restructuring\nactivities could be delayed resulting in delayed realization of the operational and financial benefits from such actions. Additionally, as a result of these plans, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge or inefficiency during transitional periods. Transformation, realignment and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business.\nThe successful implementation and execution of our restructuring, realignment and transformation actions are critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace and positioning us for future growth. Factors that may impede a successful implementation include the retention of key employees, the impact of regulatory matters including tax, matters involving certain third party service providers selected to assist us including their compliance with the Company's internal controls over financial reporting, and adverse economic market conditions. If our restructuring actions are not executed successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur strategy includes acquisitions, and we may not be able to execute acquisitions of suitable candidates or integrate acquisitions successfully.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we plan to pursue the acquisition of other companies, assets, technologies and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business. We may not be able to identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets. In addition, we cannot make assurances that any acquisition, once integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to our operations or cash flow.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: diversion of management attention from existing businesses and operations; integration of technology, operations personnel, and financial and other systems; potentially insufficient cybersecurity controls or insufficient internal controls over financial or compliance activities or financial reporting at an acquired entity that could impact us on a combined basis; the failure to realize expected synergies; the possibility that we become exposed to substantial undisclosed liabilities or new material risks associated with the acquired businesses; and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses. Failure to successfully execute our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our competitive position, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations and policies, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other applicable anti-corruption legislation and data privacy and security laws, could result in fines, criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including laws related to anti-corruption, trade regulations, including export and import compliance, anti-trust and money laundering, due to our global operations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from improper conduct of our employees or business partners. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or business partners have or may have violated applicable laws, regulations or policies, including anti-corruption laws, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business.\nAdditionally, to conduct our operations, we regularly move data across national borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches. Other countries, such as China, have enacted or are\nenacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs of compliance that are likely to increase over time. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions or civil penalties, damage to our reputation and might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe conduct approximately 53% of our business in various locations outside the United States. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency transaction exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Swedish Krona, Polish Zloty, Canadian Dollar, British Pound and Australian Dollar. Any significant change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the U.S. Dollar or Euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. The translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, Chinese Yuan, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Australian Dollar. As the U.S. Dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact business, revenue and income can be impacted. For instance, our 2018 revenue increased by 0.5% due to favorable foreign currency impacts. Strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we do business, could materially and adversely affect our sales growth in future periods. Refer to Item 7A \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" for additional information on foreign exchange risk.\nFailure to retain our existing senior management, engineering, technology, sales and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business.\nOur success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain or attract a significant number of employees in senior management, engineering, technology, sales and other key personnel. The ability to attract or retain employees will depend on our ability to offer competitive compensation, benefits, training and development and an attractive culture. We will need to continue to develop a roster of qualified talent to support business growth and replace departing employees. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. A failure to retain or attract highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our operating results or ability to operate or grow our business.\nProduct defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.\nManufacturing or design defects in (including in products or components that we source from third parties), unanticipated use of, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products could create product safety, regulatory or environmental risks, including personal injury, death or property damage. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products, result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us. Although we have liability insurance, we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any product liability claims. Manufacturing, design, software or service defects or inadequacies may also result in contractual damages or credits being issued, which could impact our profitability. Recalls, removals and product liability and quality claims can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial results can be difficult to predict.\nOur business is impacted by a substantial amount of short cycle, and book-and-bill business, which we have limited insight into, particularly for the business that we transact through our distributors. We are also impacted by large projects, whose timing can change based upon customer requirements due to a number of factors affecting the project beyond our knowledge or control, such as funding, readiness of the project and regulatory approvals. Accordingly, our financial results for any given period can be difficult to predict.\nChanges in our effective tax rates and tax expenses may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe sell our products in approximately 150 countries and 53% of our revenue was generated outside the United States in 2018. Given the global nature of our business, a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates and tax expense, including:\n\u2022\nthe geographic mix of jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed;\n\u2022\nthe statutory tax rates and tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;\n\u2022\nthe resolution of tax issues arising from tax examinations by various tax authorities; and\n\u2022\nthe valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nXylem is regularly examined by various tax authorities throughout the world and the resolutions of these examinations do not typically have a significant impact on our effective tax rates and tax expenses but they could. Additionally, in December 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation (\u201cTax Act\u201d). The legislation implements many new U.S. domestic and international tax provisions. Many aspects of the Tax Act remain unclear, and although additional clarifying guidance is expected to be issued (by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), the U.S. Treasury Department or via a technical correction law change), it may not be clarified for some time. In addition, many U.S. states have not yet updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation. As a result, there may be further impacts of the new law on our results of operations and financial condition. It is possible that the Tax Act, or interpretations under it, could change and could have an adverse effect on us, and such effect could be material.\nOur business could be adversely affected by inflation, tariffs and other manufacturing and operating cost increases.\nOur operating costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in prices for commodities, parts, raw materials, energy and related utilities, freight, and cost of labor which may be driven by prevailing price levels, exchange rates, changes in trade protection measures including tariffs, and other economic factors. In order to remain competitive, we may not be able to recuperate all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases. Further, in a declining price environment, our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the first-in, first- out method. Actions we take to mitigate volatility in manufacturing and operating costs may not be successful and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the availability of parts and raw materials or the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements.\nOur business relies on third-party suppliers, contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts and components used in our products, and we expect that reliance to increase. Parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors, fabricated parts, castings, bearings, seals, batteries, PCBs and electronic components, as well as steel, brass, nickel, copper, aluminum and plastics. We are exposed to the availability of these materials, which may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, interruptions in production by suppliers, labor disputes, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, changes in trade protection measures including tariffs, exchange rates and prevailing price levels, ability to meet regulatory requirements, weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism. Any delay in our suppliers\u2019 abilities to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operational flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our total outstanding indebtedness was $2,308 million as described under \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources.\" Our indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing or borrow additional funds;\n\u2022\ncreate uncertainty and complexity in managing debt that uses LIBOR as a reference rate, including as a result of the planned transition away from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d);\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to pay future dividends;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrequire that a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest on our\nindebtedness instead of funding working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022\nincrease the amount of interest expense that we must pay because some of our borrowings are at variable interest rates, which, as interest rates increase, would result in higher interest expense.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock, the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have.\nOur ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be negatively impacted by legal and regulatory proceedings.\nWe are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in foreign countries and in the United States, any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and damage our reputation. Changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other government policies, the nature, timing, and effect of which are uncertain, may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.\nFrom time to time we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses (or the business operations of previously owned entities). These proceedings may seek remedies relating to environmental matters, tax, intellectual property, acquisitions or divestitures, product liability and personal injury claims, privacy, employment, labor and pension matters, government contract issues and commercial or contractual disputes. Our continuing transition to connected or digital technologies and solutions has increased our exposure to intellectual property litigation and we expect that this risk will continue to increase as we execute on our innovation and technology priorities.\nIt is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations, regulatory proceedings and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period. Additionally, we may be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws, regulations or orders applicable to our business.\nThe global and diverse nature of our operations, coupled with the increase in regulation and enforcement in many regions of the globe, means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal and regulatory proceedings may affect our assessments and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWeather conditions and climate changes may adversely affect, or cause volatility in, our financial results.\nWeather conditions, including heavy flooding, droughts and fluctuations in temperatures or weather patterns, including as a result of climate change, can positively or negatively impact portions of our business. Within the dewatering space, pumps provided through our Godwin and Flygt brands are used to remove excess or unwanted water. Heavy flooding due to weather conditions drives increased demand for these applications. On the other hand, drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agricultural and turf irrigation applications, such as those provided by our Goulds Water Technology and Lowara brands. Fluctuations to warmer and cooler temperatures result in varying levels of demand for products used in residential and commercial applications where homes and buildings are heated and cooled with HVAC units such as those provided by our B&G brand. The unpredictable nature of weather conditions and climate change may result in volatility for certain portions of our business, as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers.\nIf we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, or if third parties claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury, expend significant resources enforcing our rights or defending against such claims, or be prevented from selling products or services.\nWe own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in the aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage because they may not be sufficiently broad or may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, independently developed, or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights laws are not highly developed, protected or enforced. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our products and offerings in our Measurement & Control Solutions segment are affected by the availability and regulation of radio spectrum and could be affected by interference with the radio spectrum that we use.\nA significant portion of the offering in our Measurement & Control Solutions segment use radio spectrum, which is subject to government regulation. To the extent we introduce new products designed for use in the United States or another country into a new market, such products may require significant modification or redesign in order to meet frequency requirements and other regulatory specifications. In some countries, limitations on frequency availability or the cost of making necessary modifications may preclude us from selling our products in those countries. The regulations that govern our use of the radio spectrum may change and the changes may require us to modify our products or seek new partnerships, either directly or due to interference caused by new consumer products allowed under the regulations. The inability to modify our products to meet such requirements, the possible delays in completing such modifications, and the cost of such modifications all could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, suitable partners for co-development may not be able to be secured by us.\nIn the United States, our products are primarily designed to use licensed spectrum in the 900MHz range. If the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) did not renew our existing spectrum licenses, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, there may be insufficient available frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations at a commercially feasible price or at all.\nOutside of the United States, certain of our products require the use of radio frequency and are subject to regulations. In some jurisdictions, radio station licenses may be granted for a fixed term and must be periodically renewed. Our advanced and smart metering systems offering transmits to (and receives information from, if applicable) handheld, mobile, or fixed network reading devices in licensed bands made available to us through strategic partnerships and are reliant to some extent on the licensed spectrum continuing to be available through our partners or our customers. We may be unable to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations or to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in the relevant markets at a commercially feasible price or at all.\nWe may incur impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed. As of December 31, 2018, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled approximately $3 billion. The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair\nvalue of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets represents the fair value of trademarks, trade names and FCC licenses as of the acquisition date. We do not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that we expect to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, but instead we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if interim indicators suggest that a potential impairment could exist. A goodwill impairment charge will be recognized if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, failure of the FCC to renew licenses, divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot make assurances that we will pay dividends on our common stock or continue to repurchase our common stock under Board approved share repurchase plans, and likewise our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases.\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay dividends.\nFurther, the timing and amount of the repurchase of our common stock under Board approved share repurchase plans has similar dependencies as the payment of dividends and accordingly, there can be no assurances that we will repurchase our common stock.\nAdditionally, if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations, then our ability to pay dividends, if so determined by the Board of Directors, or make share repurchases will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt, raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, reducing our dividend or delaying or curtailing share repurchases. There can be no assurance, however, that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements.\nDevelopments in environmental laws and regulations could impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations, product and service offerings are subject to and affected by many federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. In addition, we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations, including, for example, those imposed in response to climate change concerns. Compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations currently requires and is expected to continue to require operating and capital expenditures.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. We also incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations.\nDevelopments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, violations by us of such laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments, or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe level of returns on postretirement benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods.\nCertain members of our current and retired employee population are covered by pension and other employee-related defined benefit plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). We may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to our postretirement benefit plans as a result of macro-economic factors, such as interest rates, that are beyond our control. The cost of our postretirement plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors and uncertainties during those periods which can be volatile and unpredictable, including rates of return on postretirement benefit plan assets, discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses and rates of future compensation increases. Management develops each assumption using relevant plan and Company experience and expectations in conjunction with market-related data. Our liquidity, financial position (including shareholders\u2019\nequity) and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators, actuarial experience, financial market volatility, future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions.\nWe make contributions to fund our postretirement benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so. The macro-economic factors discussed above, including the return on postretirement benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by local government funding or taxing authorities, or established by other agreement, may influence future funding requirements. A significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets, or other adverse changes to our overall pension and other employee-related benefit plans, could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategy;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nstock repurchases or dividends;\n\u2022\nacquisitions and divestitures;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant new business awards;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute transformation, restructuring and realignment actions;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\nnatural or environmental disasters that investors believe may affect us;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency impacts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the budgets of federal, state and local governmental entities around the world;\n\u2022\nresults from any material litigation, governmental or regulatory body investigation, or tax examination;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022\nimpact of trade protection measures including tariffs; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our fourth amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of part or all of our business operations. For example, our articles of incorporation and our by-laws, among other things, require advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals of our business operations or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock and us.\nIn connection with our Spin-off, ITT (now ITT LLC) and Exelis, acquired by Harris Inc., will indemnify us for certain liabilities and we will indemnify ITT (now ITT LLC) or Exelis for certain liabilities. If we are required to indemnify ITT (now ITT LLC) or Exelis, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted. In the case of ITT's or Exelis' indemnity, there can be no assurance that those indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or as to ITT's or Exelis' ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements with ITT (now ITT LLC) and Exelis, ITT (now ITT LLC) and Exelis agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify ITT (now ITT LLC) and Exelis for certain liabilities. Indemnities that we may be required to provide ITT (now ITT LLC) and Exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that ITT (now ITT LLC) or Exelis has agreed to retain. Further, there can be no assurance that the indemnities from ITT (now ITT LLC) and Exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that ITT (now ITT LLC) and Exelis will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately were to succeed in recovering from ITT (now ITT LLC) and Exelis any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 13035, "SIC": 3561, "TIC": "XYL"}
