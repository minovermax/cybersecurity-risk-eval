{"cik": "1052100", "company": "WADDELL & REED FINANCIAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other risks and uncertainties contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other SEC filings. The occurrence of one or more of these risks or uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context expressly requires a different reading, when we state that a factor could \u201cadversely affect us,\u201d have a \u201cmaterial adverse effect on our business,\u201d \u201cadversely affect our business\u201d and similar expressions, we mean that the factor could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Information contained in this section may be considered \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d See \u201cPart I-Forward Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED MERGER\nRegulatory Approvals May Not Be Received, May Take Longer Than Expected Or May Impose Conditions That Are Not Presently Anticipated Or Cannot Be Met. Before the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement may be completed, various approvals must be obtained from regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or of imposing additional costs or limitations on the combined company following the merger. The regulatory approvals may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion, or may contain conditions on the completion of the merger that are not anticipated or cannot be met. If the consummation of the merger is delayed, including by a delay in receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be materially and adversely affected. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\u201d in our definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on February 17, 2021 (the \u201cProxy Statement\u201d).\nFailure Of The Merger To Be Completed, The Termination Of The Merger Agreement Or A Significant Delay In The Consummation Of The Merger Could Negatively Impact Us. The Merger Agreement is subject to a number of conditions, which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger. Please see the section entitled \u201cThe Agreement and Plan of Merger-Conditions to the Merger\u201d in the Proxy Statement. These conditions to the consummation of the merger may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the merger may not be completed or significantly delayed. In addition, if the merger is not completed by December 2, 2021, either Macquarie or we may choose to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time after that date if the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is not caused by a breach in any material respect of the Merger Agreement by the party electing to terminate the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, the consummation of the merger may be significantly delayed due to various factors, including potential litigation related to the merger.\nIf the merger is not consummated or is significantly delayed, our ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock may decline significantly, particularly to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be consummated. If the consummation of the merger is delayed, including by the receipt of a competing acquisition proposal, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we have incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. If the merger is not completed or is significantly delayed, we would have to recognize many of these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger. Any\nof the foregoing, or other risks arising in connection with the failure of or delay in consummating the merger, including the diversion of management attention from pursuing other opportunities and the constraints in the Merger Agreement on our ability to make significant changes to our ongoing business during the pendency of the merger, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger, and the market price of our common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and our board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to engage in a transaction on more attractive terms than the merger.\nWe Will Be Subject To Business Uncertainties And Contractual Restrictions While The Merger Is Pending. Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, clients, Advisors or vendors may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate employees and Advisors and attract and retain clients pending the consummation of the merger. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause our vendors and others with whom we deal to seek to change, or fail to extend, existing business relationships with us. In addition, competitors may target our existing clients by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the merger.\nThe pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration may place a burden on our management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking certain actions without Macquarie\u2019s consent while the merger is pending. If the merger is not completed, these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please see the section entitled \u201cThe Agreement and Plan of Merger-Covenants Regarding Conduct of Business by the Company and its Subsidiaries Prior to the Merger\u201d in the Proxy Statement for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable to us. Certain of the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could be heightened by these Merger Agreement restrictions resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nLitigation Against Us Or The Members Of Our Board of Directors Could Prevent Or Delay The Completion Of The Merger. While we believe that any claims asserted by purported stockholder plaintiffs related to the merger are without merit, the results of any such legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the merger from being competed in a timely manner. Moreover, any litigation could be time consuming and expensive and could divert our management\u2019s attention away from their regular business, and any lawsuit adversely resolved against us or members of our board of directors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe conditions to the consummation of the merger include the absence of any law, injunction or governmental order restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the absence of any law, injunction or governmental order initiated by a governmental entity restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of Macquarie\u2019s sale of our wealth management business to LPL Holdings, Inc. Consequently, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in any lawsuit that is filed or any regulatory proceeding and a claimant secures injunctive or other relief or a regulatory authority issues an order or other directive having the effect of making the merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the merger, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the merger from becoming effective in a timely manner or at all.\nMARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS\nWe Could Experience Adverse Effects On Our Market Share Due To Competition.\u2003The investment management industry is highly competitive. We compete with investment management firms, wealth management\ncompanies, investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, internet investment sites, mobile investment products, automated financial advisors, registered investment advisers, and other financial institutions and individuals based on a number of factors, including investment performance, the level of fees charged, the quality and diversity of products and services offered, name recognition and reputation, and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. Many of these competitors not only offer mutual fund investments and services, but also offer an ever-increasing number of other financial products and services and have better brand recognition. See Item 1 - \u201cBusiness - Competition.\u201d If existing or potential clients decide to invest with our competitors instead of with us, our market share could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere are a number of asset classes and product types that are not well covered by our current products and services. When these asset classes or products are in favor with investors, our competitors may receive outsized flows compared to others in the industry. As a result, we may miss the opportunity to gain the AUM that are being invested in these assets and face the risk of our managed assets being withdrawn in favor of competitors who offer these classes or products. For example, the trend in recent years in the asset management business in favor of lower fee, passive investment strategies, such as index and certain types of exchange-traded funds, favors our competitors who provide those products over active managers like us. In addition, we are not typically the lowest cost provider of asset management services. To the extent that we compete on the basis of price, we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure, which could adversely affect our operating revenues.\nOur Business And Prospects Could Be Adversely Affected If The Securities Markets Decline Or Are Volatile.\u2003Our results of operations are affected by certain economic factors, including the success of the securities markets. Substantial fluctuations in the securities markets can occur on a daily basis and over longer periods as a result of a variety of factors, including national and international economic and political events, broad trends in business and finance, and interest rate movements. Adverse market conditions, particularly in the U.S. domestic stock market due to our high concentration of AUM in that market, and lack of investor confidence could result in investors further withdrawing from the markets or decreasing their rate of investment, either of which could adversely affect our revenues, earnings and growth prospects.\nOur revenues are based on the market value of AUM and AUA. A decline in the securities markets may cause the value of our AUM and/or AUA to decline or cause investors to redeem or sell assets in favor of investments they perceive offer greater opportunity or lower risk, both of which decrease investment management and other fees and could significantly reduce our revenues and earnings. We do not hedge our revenue stream from this risk through derivatives or other financial contracts. Our growth is dependent to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain mutual fund assets and advisory assets, and, in an adverse economic environment, this may prove more difficult. The combination of adverse market conditions reducing both sales and investment management fees could compound one another and adversely affect our business.\nThere May Be Adverse Effects On Our Business If Our Funds\u2019 Performance Declines.\u2003 Success in the investment management and mutual fund businesses, including the growth and retention of AUM, is dependent on the investment performance of client accounts relative to market conditions and the performance of competing funds. From time to time, we may experience poor investment performance, on a relative or absolute basis, in certain products or accounts that we manage, which may contribute to a significant reduction in our AUM and revenues. A Fund\u2019s performance record is calculated over various trailing periods and, therefore, the Fund\u2019s underperformance may continue to be reflected in a particular trailing period long after the Fund\u2019s performance has improved. Accordingly, the Fund may experience delays in realizing, or may not realize, any increase in asset flows from improved performance. Good relative performance stimulates sales of the Funds\u2019 shares and tends to keep redemptions low. Sales of the Funds\u2019 shares in turn generate higher management fees and distribution revenues. Good relative performance may also attract institutional accounts and may result in higher ratings or rankings by research services such as Morningstar, Lipper or eVestment Alliance, which may compound the foregoing effects. Conversely, poor relative performance results in decreased sales, increased redemptions of the Funds\u2019 shares and the loss of institutional accounts, resulting in decreases in our AUM and revenues. Poor investment performance also may adversely affect our ability to expand the distribution of our products through unaffiliated third parties. Further, any drop in market share of mutual fund sales in our wealth management channel may further reduce profits, as sales of unaffiliated mutual funds are less profitable than sales of our Funds.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 42% our AUM were concentrated in five Funds. As a result, our operating results are significantly affected by the performance of those Funds and our ability to minimize redemptions from and maintain AUM in those Funds. If we experienced a significant amount of redemptions of those Funds for any reason, our revenues would\ndecline, and our operating results would be adversely affected. Further, any adverse performance of those Funds may also indirectly affect the net sales and redemptions in our other products, which in turn, may adversely affect our business.\nChanges In The Distribution Channels In Which We Operate Could Reduce Our Net Revenues and Adversely Affect Our AUM, Revenues and Growth Prospects. Our ability to market and distribute the Funds and other investment products we manage is significantly dependent on access to third party financial intermediaries that distribute these products. We sell a significant portion of our investment products through a variety of such intermediaries, including major wire houses, national and regional broker-dealers, defined contribution plan administrators, retirement platforms and registered investment advisers. AUM in our unaffiliated channel at December 31, 2020 were $28.0 billion, or 37% of total AUM. It would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries. As third-party intermediaries rationalize and reduce the number of product offerings on their platforms, including in response to new best interest and fiduciary standards, we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of investment product offerings, or access to these intermediaries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Relying on third party intermediaries also exposes us to the risk of increasing costs of distribution, as certain intermediaries with which we conduct business charge fees (largely determined by the distributor) to maintain access to their distribution networks. If we choose not to pay such fees, our ability to distribute through those intermediaries would be limited; significant increases in such fees will cause our distribution costs to increase, which could lower our profitability. In addition, over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become considerably more concentrated, as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms.\nOver half of our AUM, $43.3 billion, or 58%, as of December 31, 2020 are held in our wealth management channel. The investment products distributed in our wealth management channel include our Funds and other products, as well as products issued by unaffiliated mutual fund companies. A significant portion of the sales in this channel are sales of Funds, upon which we earn higher revenues from asset management fees as compared to the sale of unaffiliated funds. Sales of affiliated investment products in our wealth management channel may decrease (and redemptions increase) materially with the introduction of additional unaffiliated investment products in our advisory programs. Further, qualified accounts, particularly IRAs, make up a significant portion of our AUM and AUA in this channel, and a significant portion of those retirement assets are invested in our affiliated products. The introduction of additional unaffiliated products in this channel, sustained underperformance of key investment products, and the implementation of best interest and fiduciary standards could cause us to experience lower sales of our affiliated investment products, increased redemptions, or other developments that may not be fully offset by higher distribution revenues or other benefits. As a result, our AUM, AUA, revenues and earnings may decline. See \u201cLegal, Regulatory and Tax Risks\u201d below for the impact that changes to standards of conduct applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisers and potential fiduciary standards may have on our business, including our distribution activities.\nIncreasingly, investors, particularly in the institutional market, rely on external consultants and other third-party financial professionals for advice on the choice of an investment adviser and investment portfolio. Further, the institutional account business uses referrals from investment consultants, investment advisers and other professionals. These consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients\u2019 choices, and they may favor a competitor of ours. We cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future. The Company cannot be certain that it will continue to have access to these third-party distribution channels or have an opportunity to offer some or all of its investment products through these channels. Further, their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their client assets under our management. Any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources and the consultant community could impair our ability to sell our products, which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability.\nA Significant Percentage Of Our AUM Are Distributed Through Our Unaffiliated Channel, Which Has Higher Redemption Rates Than Our Wealth Management Channel.\u2003 The percentage of our AUM in the unaffiliated channel was 37% at December 31, 2020, and the percentage of our total sales represented by the unaffiliated channel was 64% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The success of sales in our unaffiliated channel depends upon our maintaining strong relationships with certain strategic partners, third party distributors and institutional accounts, as well as on the performance of our investment products marketed through this channel. Many of those distribution sources also offer investors competing funds that are internally or externally managed or may reduce the number of competing products on their platforms through systemic rationalization and reduction, which could limit the distribution of our products. The loss of any of these distribution channels and the inability to continue to access new distribution channels could decrease our AUM and adversely affect our results of operations and growth. There are no assurances that these channels and their\nclient bases will continue to be accessible to us. The loss or diminution of the level of business we do with those providers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Compared to the industry average redemption rate of 28.8% and 21.7% for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, the unaffiliated channel had redemption rates of 37.9% and 38.1% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Redemption rates were 13.4% and 13.8% for our wealth management channel in the same periods, reflecting the higher rate of transferability of investment assets in the unaffiliated channel. However, the modernization of our wealth management platforms and products and the introduction of additional unaffiliated investment products in our advisory programs, as well as changes resulting from the implementation of new best interest and fiduciary standards, may result in a higher redemption rate in our wealth management channel, as Advisors may move to sell more unaffiliated products. An increase in the sale of unaffiliated mutual funds compared to sales of the Funds in our wealth management channel may reduce profits, as sales of unaffiliated mutual funds are less profitable than sales of our Funds. See \u201cLegal, Regulatory and Tax Risks.\u201d\nFee Pressures Could Reduce Our Revenues And Profitability.\u2003There is an accelerating trend toward lower fees in some segments of the investment management business. The SEC has adopted rules that are designed to alter mutual fund corporate governance, which could result in further downward pressure on investment advisory fees in the mutual fund industry. Investors and clients are increasingly fee sensitive. Active management continues to experience pressure by increased flows to lower fee passive products. This trend has resulted in pressure on active management firms to reduce fees to compete with passive products. New best interest and fiduciary standards could increase fee pressure as financial advisors may have more fee sensitivity given their higher standard of conduct. In addition, competition could cause us to reduce the fees we charge for products and services. In the event that competitors charge lower fees for substantially similar products, we may be forced to compete on the basis of price in order to attract and retain clients. In the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase AUM. The investment management agreements with the Funds continue in effect from year to year only if approved by the Funds\u2019 board of trustees. Periodic review of these advisory agreements could result in a reduction in investment management fee revenues received from the Funds. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could reduce our operating revenues and may adversely affect our business, future revenue and profitability.\nThe fees we earn vary depending on the type of asset managed, the type of client, the type of asset management product or service provided and whether the product is sub-advised. A shift in the mix of our AUM from higher revenue-generating assets to lower revenue-generating assets may result in a decrease in our operating revenues even if our aggregate AUM do not change. There can be no assurance that we will achieve a more favorable product mix in the future.\nOur Ability To Attract And Retain Key Personnel And Advisors Is Significant To Our Success.\u2003Our success is largely dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, including our corporate officers, portfolio managers, investment analysts, and sales and client relationship personnel, many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry. The market for experienced asset management personnel is extremely competitive. Most of our employees do not have employment agreements, and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time. Those employees who are subject to employment agreements are generally eligible to terminate their employment at any time upon written notice. Due to the competitive market for these professionals and the success of our highly skilled employees, our costs to attract and retain key personnel are significant. If we are unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals, the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic objectives, compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted. Because the investment track record of many of our products and services is often attributed to a small number of individual employees, the departure of one or more of these employees could damage our reputation and result in the loss of assets or client accounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, it could damage our reputation, make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees, cause our retention costs to increase significantly, and materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, a significant portion of the sales of our mutual funds, investment products, annuities and insurance products are sold in our wealth management channel. Our success is directly affected by the quality, quantity and productivity of Advisors who continue to manage their independent practices through their association with us. The market for experienced and productive Advisors is highly competitive, and we devote significant resources to attracting and retaining Advisors. If we are unable to attract new Advisors or to retain existing Advisors, our business may be adversely impacted.\nThere May Be An Adverse Effect On Our Business If Our Investors Redeem The Assets We Manage On Short Notice.\u2003 Our investment management agreements with institutions and other non-mutual fund accounts are generally terminable upon relatively short notice, and investors in the Funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the Funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce the aggregate amount of AUM, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment trends, investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in investment preferences of clients, changes in our reputation in the marketplace, changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships, loss of key investment management or other personnel, and financial market performance. In addition, in a declining securities market, the pace of mutual fund redemptions and withdrawal of assets from other accounts could accelerate. Poor investment performance generally or relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased purchases of Fund shares, increased redemptions of Fund shares, and the loss of institutional or individual accounts. Historically, the risk of our investors redeeming their investments in the Funds on short notice has been greater for assets in our unaffiliated channel. Additionally, redemptions in our wealth management channel may increase materially with the introduction of additional unaffiliated investment products in our advisory programs. The implementation of new best interest and fiduciary standards could also result in increased redemptions. An increase in redemptions and the corresponding decrease in our AUM may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere May Be Adverse Effects On Our Business Upon The Termination Of, Or Failure To Renew, Certain Agreements. A majority of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements with the Funds that, as required by law, are terminable on 60 days\u2019 notice. Each investment management agreement must be approved and renewed annually by the disinterested members of each Fund\u2019s board of trustees or its shareholders, as required by law. Additionally, our investment management agreements provide for automatic termination in the event of assignment, which includes a change of control, without the consent of our clients and, in the case of the Funds, approval of the Funds\u2019 board of trustees and shareholders to continue the agreements. There can be no assurances that our clients will consent to any assignment of our investment management agreements, or that those and other contracts will not be terminated or will be renewed on favorable terms, if at all, at their expiration and new agreements may not be available. The decrease in revenues that could result from any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe May Be Unable To Develop New Products And Support Provided To New Products May Reduce Fee Revenue, Increase Expenses And Expose Us To Potential Loss On Invested Capital. Our financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to develop, market and manage new investment products and services, which may require significant time and resources, as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services, and compliance with regulatory requirements. A failure to continue to innovate to introduce new products and services, or to manage successfully the risks associated with such products and services, may impact our market share relevance and may cause our AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, changes to the standards of conduct applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisers could require modifications to our distribution activities and impact our ability to engage in certain types of distribution or other business activities.\nAdditionally, we may support the development of new investment products by waiving a portion of the fees we usually receive for managing such products, by subsidizing expenses, or by making seed capital investments. There can be no assurance that new investment products we develop will be successful, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support new products could have an adverse impact on our future growth. Seed capital investments in new products utilize capital that would otherwise be available for general corporate purposes and expose us to capital losses due to investment market risk. Our non-operating investment and other income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant other-than-temporary impairments in the case of our available-for-sale portfolio and the recognition of unrealized losses related to our sponsored investment portfolios that are held as trading and accounted for under the equity method. We may use various derivative instruments to mitigate the risk of our seed capital investments, although some market risk would remain. The risk of loss may be greater for seed capital investments that are not hedged, or if an intended hedge does not perform as expected. Our use of derivatives would result in counterparty risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these derivative instruments, regulatory risk and the risk that the underlying positions do not move in relation to the related derivative instruments. As a result, volatility in the capital markets may affect the value of our seed capital investments, which may increase the volatility of our earnings and adversely affect our business.\nThe Failure Or Negative Performance Of Products Offered By Competitors May Cause AUM In Our Similar Products To Decline Irrespective Of The Performance Of Our Products. Many competitors offer similar products to those offered by us and the failure or negative performance of competitors\u2019 products or the loss of confidence in a product type could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products offered by us, irrespective of the performance of our products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to redemptions in such products, which may cause the Company\u2019s AUM to decline and materially affect our business.\nThe Impairment Or Failure Of Other Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect Our Business. We routinely execute transactions with counterparties, including brokers-dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients that expose us or the Funds or accounts we manage to operational, credit or other risks in the event that a counterparty with whom the Company transacts defaults on its obligations or if there are other unrelated systemic failures in the markets. Although we regularly assess risks posed by counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may otherwise fail to meet their obligations. Any such impairment failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts we manage, which could lead to the loss of clients and may cause our AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nRestrictions On Our Ability To Use \u201cSoft Dollars\u201d Could Result In An Increase In Our Expenses.\u2003On behalf of our mutual fund and investment advisory clients, we make decisions to buy and sell securities for each portfolio, select broker-dealers to execute trades, and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with these transactions, we receive \u201csoft dollar credits\u201d from broker-dealers that we use to defray certain of our research and brokerage expenses consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. If our use of \u201csoft-dollars\u201d decreases or is eliminated, including due to the adoption of regulations or changes to market practice, or if the \u201csoft dollars\u201d we generate decrease because of reductions to our AUM or commission rates, our operating expenses could increase.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND TAX RISKS\nRegulatory Risk Is Substantial In Our Business And Regulatory Reforms Could Have A Material Adverse Effect On Our Business. Virtually all aspects of our business, including the activities of our parent company and our investment advisory and wealth management subsidiaries, are heavily regulated, primarily at the federal level. The regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen a significant increase in regulation in recent years, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For a discussion of laws, regulations (including certain pending regulatory reforms) and regulators to which we are subject, see Item 1 - \u201cBusiness - Regulation.\u201d\nAt this time, we cannot predict the nature or full impact of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, nor the extent to which current or future proposals, or possible enforcement proceedings, will impact our business. Any new and developing laws and regulations are likely to result in greater compliance and administrative burdens, including the investment of significant management time and resources in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment, and the imposition of new compliance costs and/or capital requirements, including costs related to information technology systems. Changes to legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business may require changes to the way we conduct business, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. There are no assurances that we will be able to successfully execute changes and enhancements to our business model, operations, technology and compliance policies and procedures required by changing legal and regulatory requirements, which could materially and adversely affect our business. New legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business could also create additional liability exposure to regulatory enforcement. The evolving regulatory environment may impact a number of our service providers and, to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees, it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer. Changes in current rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes in current legal, regulatory, accounting or compliance requirements, including state and federal taxation, or in governmental policies, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nCompliance Within A Complex Regulatory Environment Imposes Significant Financial And Strategic Costs On Our Business, and Non-Compliance Could Result in Fines And Penalties. Non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in criminal and civil liability, the suspension of our employees, sanctions being levied against us, including fines, penalties and censures, injunctive relief, suspension or expulsion from a certain jurisdiction or market, or the temporary or permanent revocation of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business. A regulatory proceeding, even one that does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions, could consume substantial expenditures\nof time and capital. Any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business and prospects.\nOur Business Is Subject To Substantial Risk From Litigation, Regulatory Investigations And Potential Securities Laws Liability.\u2003Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of litigation, regulatory investigations and/or arbitration, and from time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings in the course of operating our business. See Item 3 - \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d We are exposed to liability under federal and state securities laws, other federal and state laws and court decisions, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, FINRA and other regulatory bodies. These regulatory bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices, and those of our employees and the Advisors, and to bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our employees or the Advisors, are improper. Actions brought against us may result in awards, settlements, penalties, injunctions or other adverse results, including reputational damage. In addition, we may incur significant expenses in connection with our defense against such actions regardless of their outcome. We, our subsidiaries, and/or certain of our past and present directors and officers, have been named as parties in legal actions, regulatory investigations and proceedings, and/or securities arbitrations in the past, and have been subject to claims alleging violation of such laws, rules and regulations, which have resulted in the payment of fines and settlements. From time to time, we receive subpoenas or other requests for information from governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations or proceedings. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings, have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant regulator to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in the Funds, other clients or by our stockholders, which could harm the Company\u2019s reputation, potentially harm the investment returns of the Funds, or result in the Company being liable for damages.\nIn addition, the Funds to which we provide investment advisory and management services are subject to litigation and governmental and self-regulatory organization investigations and proceedings, any of which could harm the investment returns or reputation of the applicable Fund or result in our investment adviser subsidiaries being liable to the Funds for any resulting damages.\nThere has been an increase in litigation and regulatory investigations in the asset management and financial services industries in recent years, including client claims, class action suits and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties. An adverse resolution of any lawsuit, legal or regulatory proceeding or claim against us could result in substantial costs or reputational harm to us and have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition to these financial costs and risks, the defense of litigation, regulatory investigations or arbitration may divert resources and management\u2019s attention from operations.\nInsurance May Not Be Available On A Cost Effective Basis And Insurance Coverage May Not Protect Us From Liability. We face inherent liability risk related to litigation from mutual fund investors, clients, third party vendors and others, and actions taken by regulatory agencies. To help protect against these potential liabilities, we purchase insurance in amounts, and against risks, that we consider appropriate and commercially reasonable, where such insurance is available at prices we deem acceptable. There can be no assurance, however, that a claim or claims will be covered by insurance or, if covered, will not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage, that any insurer will remain solvent and will meet its obligations to provide us with coverage, or that insurance coverage will continue to be available with sufficient limits at a reasonable cost. Insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and the risk profile of the insured, including prior claims, and may increase significantly over relatively short periods. In addition, certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs. Renewals of insurance policies may expose us to additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or co-insurance liability.\nFinancial Advisors Associated With Our Wealth Management Business Are Classified As Independent Contractors, And Changes To Their Classification May Increase Our Operating Expenses. From time to time, various legislative or regulatory proposals are introduced at the federal or state levels addressing the criteria for determining the status of independent contractors\u2019 classification as employees for either employment tax purposes (withholding, social security, Medicare and unemployment taxes) or other employment benefits. Currently, most individuals are classified as employees or independent contractors for employment tax purposes based on relevant statutory, regulatory and common law tests, including the multi-factor test utilized by the Internal Revenue Service. We classify Advisors as independent contractors for all purposes, including employment tax. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial or regulatory (including tax) authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change the independent contractor classification of those Advisors or that private litigants might file actions seeking to\nchange such classification. The costs associated with potential changes, if any, with respect to these independent contractor classifications could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMisconduct By Our Employees And/Or By Advisors Could Result In Liability, Subject Us To Regulatory Sanctions Or Otherwise Adversely Affect Our Business, Results of Operations or Financial Condition.\u2003Our business is based on the trust and confidence of our clients, for whom Advisors handle a significant amount of funds, as well as financial and personal information. Misconduct by our employees or by Advisors could result in violations of law, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm. Misconduct that could occur includes: (i) binding us to transactions that exceed authorized limits; (ii) hiding unauthorized or unsuccessful activities resulting in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses; (iii) improperly using, disclosing or otherwise compromising confidential information; (iv) recommending transactions that are not suitable; (v) engaging in fraudulent or otherwise improper activity, including the misappropriation of funds; (vi) engaging in unauthorized or excessive trading to the detriment of clients; or (vii) otherwise not complying with laws, regulations or our control procedures. Although we have implemented a system of internal controls to minimize the risk of misconduct, there can be no assurance that our controls or precautions to detect and prevent misconduct will be effective in all cases. Preventing and detecting misconduct among Advisors, who are not employees, presents additional challenges. We could be liable in the event of misconduct by employees or Advisors and we could also be subject to regulatory sanctions. Although we believe that we have adequately insured against these risks, there can be no assurance that our insurance will be maintained or that it will be adequate to meet any liability resulting from these activities. Any damage to the trust and confidence placed in us by our clients may cause our AUM and/or AUA to decline, which could adversely affect our reputation, business and prospects and lead to a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Application Of Tax Laws And Regulations And Challenges To Our Tax Positions May Adversely Affect Our Effective Tax Rate And Business. The application of complex tax laws and regulations involves numerous uncertainties. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax positions that we have taken, as we are periodically under audit by various state and federal jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our financial statements. Tax authorities may assess additional taxes, which could result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, and may adversely affect our effective tax rate and business.\nOPERATIONAL AND TECHNOLOGY RISKS\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic Could Have A Material Adverse Effect On Our Business, Results Of Operations Or Financial Condition. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption in global financial markets, including significant volatility in the securities markets. Declines in our AUM and AUA negatively impact our future revenues, earnings and growth prospects. In addition, certain of the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could be heightened by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic conditions resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, including due to:\n\u25cf declines in the securities markets or our Funds\u2019 performance, which could result in decreased sales and increased redemptions;\n\u25cf unprecedented market dislocation and disparate impact on particular businesses and industries;\n\u25cf availability of financing capital;\n\u25cf disruption of worldwide supply chains;\n\u25cf negative impacts to our distribution channels or other financial institutions with which we do business;\n\u25cf a work-from-home environment, which could result in reductions in our operating effectiveness or efficiency, increased operational, compliance and cybersecurity risks, the failure of controls and risk management policies to identify and manage risks, or the failure or breach of our operational or security systems or our technology infrastructure;\n\u25cf the unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities and operational challenges and costs associated with the return of employees from their remote working environments to the workplace;\n\u25cf travel and visitation restrictions that limit our ability to engage with management of businesses in which we invest or may invest and with clients and business partners;\n\u25cf the ability of Advisors to interact with clients and access their leased office spaces;\n\u25cf actions and recommendations of federal, state and local governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; or\n\u25cf our inability to reduce the level of our expenses to align with decreases in our revenues.\nWe are unable to accurately predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to various uncertainties, including the duration of the outbreak and length of time it will take for the financial markets and economy to recover and for our employees to safely return to the workplace. We closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, continually assessing its potential effects on our business and on the businesses in which we invest. The extent to which our business and financial results are affected by COVID-19 will largely depend on future developments, which cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain.\nFor additional discussion regarding the impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition due to COVID-19 and the related economic conditions, please see Part II - Item 7 - \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Impact of COVID-19\u201d.\nOur Business Is Subject to Numerous Operational Risks. Sustained Interruptions In Our Operating Systems, Technology Systems, Or Other Failure In Operational Execution, Could Materially And Adversely Affect Our Business. We face numerous and complex operational risks related to our business on a day-to-day basis. Operating risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf failure to properly perform or oversee mutual fund or portfolio recordkeeping responsibilities, including portfolio accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, investment restrictions compliance, daily NAV computations, account reconciliations, and required distributions to Fund shareholders to comply with tax regulations;\n\u25cf failure to properly oversee transfer agent and participant recordkeeping responsibilities, including transaction processing, supervision of staff, tax reporting, and record retention;\n\u25cf sales and marketing risks, including the intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of products and services in advertising materials, public relations information, or other external communications, and failure to properly calculate and present investment performance data accurately and in accordance with established guidelines and regulations;\n\u25cf failure to properly perform brokerage business responsibilities, including processing trades and client information timely and accurately, maintenance of books and records, execution of financial planning activities, and supervisory and compliance activities; and\n\u25cf our reliance on third party vendors who, now or in the future, may perform or support important parts of our operations as there can be no assurance that they will perform properly or that our processes and plans to execute, transition or delegate these functions to others will be successful or that there will not be interruptions in services from these third parties.\nThe systems upon which we rely to conduct our business may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other third party service providers that we use to facilitate, or are component providers to, our brokerage operations, securities transactions and other product manufacturing and distribution activities. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely\nimpact our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk, or otherwise achieve desired outcomes. Failure to keep current and accurate books and records can render us subject to disciplinary action by governmental and self-regulatory authorities, as well as to claims by our clients. In connection with the modernization of our wealth management platforms and products, a significant portion of our software is licensed from and supported by third party vendors upon whom we rely to prevent operating system failure. A suspension or termination of these licenses or the related support, upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption. If any of our financial, portfolio accounting, brokerage or other data processing systems, or the systems of third parties on whom we rely, do not operate properly or are disabled, or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, or those of third parties on whom we rely, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory problems or damage to our reputation.\nInterruptions could be caused by operational failures arising from service provider, employee or Advisor error or malfeasance, interference by third parties, including hackers, our implementation of new technology, as well as from our maintenance of existing technology. Our financial, accounting, brokerage, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate or report data properly, experience connectivity disruptions or otherwise become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, adversely affecting our ability to process transactions or provide products and services to our clients. Although we have developed and maintain a comprehensive business continuity plan, and require our key technology vendors and service providers to do the same, there are inherent limitations in such plans and they might not, despite testing and monitoring, operate as designed. Further, we cannot control the execution of any business continuity plans implemented by our service providers.\nFailure To Implement New Information Technology Systems Successfully Could Materially And Adversely Affect Our Business. We are in the process of continuing to modernize our wealth management platforms and products and implementing new information technology systems, including a new business administration platform and integrated data repository that we believe will facilitate and improve our core businesses and our productivity, and position our wealth management channel for long-term competitiveness. We may be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure. Our technology infrastructure is vital to the competitiveness of our business. We depend on specialized technology to operate our business and a number of our key information technology systems were developed solely to handle our particular information technology infrastructure. Our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate necessary technology systems across our organization, and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client, industry, and regulatory demands. There can be no assurance that we will successfully implement new information technology systems, that our existing technology infrastructure can support new systems or changes to existing systems, that their implementation will be completed in a timely or cost effective manner, or that we will derive the expected benefits from these new systems. Failure to implement or maintain adequate information technology infrastructure may cause us to lose investors, clients, Advisors and fail to maintain regulatory compliance, which could severely damage our reputation, impede our ability to support business growth, and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nA Failure In Or Breach Of Our Operational Or Security Systems Or Our Technology Infrastructure, Or Those Of Third Parties, Or Failure To Maintain Adequate Business Continuity Plans, Could Result In A Material Adverse Effect On Our Business And Reputation. We are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and third party software applications and other technology systems to operate our business. As part of our normal operations, we process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and maintain and transmit confidential client and employee information, the safety and security of which is dependent upon the effectiveness of our information security policies, procedures, capabilities and employees to protect such systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, technology is subject to rapid change and the nature of the threats continue to evolve. As a result, our operating and technology systems, software and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled, or may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, inadvertent disclosure, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events that could materially damage our operations, have an adverse security impact, or cause the disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information. Further, a cybersecurity intrusion could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection, and any investigation of a cybersecurity intrusion could require a substantial amount of time. During all this time we might not know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and errors or omissions could be repeated or compounded before being discovered and remediated, all of which could aggravate the costs and consequences of the intrusion. Most of the software applications that we use in our business are licensed from, and are supported, upgraded and maintained by, third party vendors. A suspension or termination of certain of these licenses or the related support, upgrades and maintenance could cause temporary system\ndelays or interruptions. We also take precautions to password protect and/or encrypt our laptops and other mobile electronic hardware; however, if such hardware is stolen, misplaced or left unattended, it may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk and resulting in potentially costly actions against us. While we collaborate with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and otherwise protect against cyber-attacks, we cannot ensure that we or any third parties haves all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality and integrity of such information. Further, while we have in place a disaster recovery plan to ensure we can recover from and continue our business upon the occurrence of catastrophic and unpredictable events, there is no guarantee that this plan will be sufficient in responding to or ameliorating the effects of all disaster scenarios, and we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters, power failures, acts of war, and third party failures. In addition, we rely to varying degrees on third party vendors for disaster contingency support, and we cannot be assured that these vendors will always be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner.\nThe breach of our operational or information security systems or our technology infrastructure, or those of third parties, due to one or more of these events could cause interruptions, malfunctions or failures in our operations and/or the loss or inadvertent disclosure of confidential client information could result in substantial financial loss or costs, liability for stolen assets or information, breach of client contracts, client dissatisfaction and/or other reputational loss, regulatory actions, remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach, additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents, costs to provide notice to and credit monitoring for affected clients, and litigation costs resulting from the incident. Although we seek to assess regularly and improve our existing disaster recovery plans, a major disaster, or one that affected certain important operating areas, or our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability. These events, and those discussed above, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe remain subject to various state and federal laws and regulations related to the privacy, integrity and security of nonpublic personal information we create, collect and maintain in the conduct of our business concerning individuals, including Fund trustees and shareholders, our directors and shareholders, our clients, Advisors\u2019 clients and our employees and independent contractors. For example, the State of California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which was effective January 1, 2020 and, among other things, created detailed notice, opt-out/opt-in, access and erasure rights for consumers vis-\u00e0-vis businesses that collect their personal information, and provides a new private cause of action for data breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act, which was approved by ballot in November 2020 and will be effective in January 2023, augments and expands the CCPA. Other states have enacted or proposed, or in the future may enact, similar privacy and data security legislation. Privacy and data security laws and regulations, particularly when enacted on a state by state basis rather than at the federal level, could impose significant limitations, require changes to our business, restrict our collection, use or storage of nonpublic personal information and subject us to legal liability or regulatory action, which may result in increased compliance expenses, fines or penalties, the termination of client contracts, costly mitigation activities and harm to our reputation.\nFailure To Establish Adequate Controls And Risk Management Policies, The Circumvention Of Controls And Risk Management Policies, Or Fraud Could Have An Adverse Effect On Our Reputation And Financial Position. We have established a comprehensive risk management process and continue to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks; however, we cannot assure that such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to our business. We are subject to the risk that our employees, Advisors, contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud or act in ways that are inconsistent with our controls, policies and procedures. Persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls, or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interest or transgressions of policies and controls, could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation and lead to costly regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions.\nOur Own Operational Failures Or Those Of Third Parties We Rely On, Including Failures Arising Out Of Human Error, Could Disrupt Our Business And Damage Our Reputation. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, large numbers of transactions. These transactions generally must comply with client investment guidelines, as well as stringent legal and regulatory standards. Despite our employees being highly trained and skilled, due to the large number of transactions we process, errors may occur. If we make mistakes in performing our services that cause financial harm to our clients, our clients may seek to recover their losses. The occurrence of mistakes, particularly significant ones, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nA Failure To Protect Our Reputation Could Adversely Affect Our Businesses. Our reputation is one of our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain clients, investors, employees and Advisors is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our Company. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, any perceived or actual weakness in our financial strength or liquidity, technological, cybersecurity, or other security breaches (including attempted breaches) resulting in improper disclosure of client or employee personal information, unethical behavior, and the misconduct of employees, Advisors and counterparties. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters, even if they are baseless or eventually satisfactorily addressed, could damage our reputation among existing and potential clients, investors, employees and Advisors. Reputations may take decades to re-build, and negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.\nOur reputation is also dependent on our continued identification of and mitigation against conflicts of interest, including those relating to our proprietary activities. For example, conflicts may arise between our position as a provider of financial planning services and as an investment adviser to Funds that an Advisor may recommend to a financial planning client. We have procedures and controls that are designed to identify, address and appropriately disclose perceived conflicts of interest. However, identifying and appropriately addressing conflicts of interest is complex, and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to address conflicts of interest appropriately.\nIn addition, the SEC and other federal and state regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest, including through the implementation of new best interest and fiduciary standards. It is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions. It is possible also that the regulatory scrutiny of, and litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest will make our clients less willing to enter into transactions in which such a conflict may occur, and may materially affect our business.\nOur Expenses Are Subject To Fluctuations That Could Materially Affect Our Operating Results. Our results of operations are dependent, in part, on the level of our expenses, which can vary significantly from period to period.\nIncreases in the level of our expenses, or our inability to reduce the level of our expenses, could materially affect our operating results. If we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner to align with decreases in our revenue due to, among other things, a decline in the level of our AUM or AUA, or our current business environment, through operational changes or performance improvement, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe Have Significant Goodwill and Intangibles On Our Balance Sheet, And Any Impairment Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations. At December 31, 2020, our total assets were approximately $1.15 billion, of which approximately $145.9 million, or 13%, consisted of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. See Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d We complete an ongoing review of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or a change in circumstances warrant. Important factors in determining whether an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets might exist include significant continued underperformance compared to peers, the likelihood of termination or non-renewal of a mutual fund advisory or sub-advisory contract or substantial changes in revenues earned from such contracts, significant changes in our business and products, material and ongoing negative industry or economic trends, or other factors specific to each asset or subsidiary being tested. Because of the significance of goodwill and other intangibles to our consolidated balance sheets, the impairment analysis is critical. Any changes in key assumptions about our business and our prospects, or changes in market conditions or other externalities, could result in an impairment charge. Any such charge could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nThe Terms Of Our Credit Facility Impose Restrictions On Our Operations That May Adversely Impact Our Prospects And The Operations Of Our Business.\u2003 On October 20, 2020, we entered into a 364-day revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with various lenders providing for total availability of $100 million. Under the Credit Facility, the lenders may, at their option upon our request, expand the Credit Facility to $200 million. At February 5, 2021, there was no balance outstanding under the Credit Facility. The terms and conditions of the Credit Facility impose restrictions that affect, among other things, our ability to incur additional debt, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, merge, sell assets, pay dividends and create or incur liens. Our ability to comply with the financial covenants set forth in\nthe Credit Facility could be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve operating results that will comply with such terms and conditions, a breach of which could result in a default under the Credit Facility. In the event of a default under the Credit Facility, the lenders could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of the Credit Facility, all interest thereon, and all other amounts payable under the Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable.\nOur ability to meet our cash needs will depend upon our future operating performance, asset values, the perception of our creditworthiness and, indirectly, the market value of our common stock. These factors may be affected by prevailing economic, financial and business conditions and other circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. We anticipate that available cash, marketable securities, cash flow from operations and any funds generated by any borrowings from the Credit Facility will provide sufficient funds to finance our operating and capital requirements. However, in the event that we require additional capital, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or refinance the Credit Facility upon their maturity or on favorable terms. If we are unable to raise capital or obtain financing, we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plan.\nNet Capital Requirements May Impede The Business Operations Of Our Subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal, state, and foreign authorities. Each of our subsidiaries\u2019 net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements; however, a significant change in the required net capital, an operating loss, or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur Holding Company Structure Results In Structural Subordination And May Affect Our Ability To Fund Our Operations And Make Payments On Our Debt.\u2003We are a holding company and, accordingly, substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As a result, our cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of earnings, loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. Payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and business considerations. Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization, and therefore the right of the holders of our debt to participate in those assets, would be effectively subordinated to the claims of those subsidiaries\u2019 creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us.\nThere Are No Assurances That We Will Pay Future Dividends On, Or Repurchase Shares Of, Our Class A Common Stock, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Stock Price.\u2003The Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d) currently intends to continue to declare quarterly dividends on, and to authorize the repurchase of shares of, our Class A common stock. However, the declaration and payment of dividends and the repurchase of common stock is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and the terms of the Merger Agreement limit our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock while the merger is pending. Any determination as to the payment of dividends or repurchase of common stock, as well as the level of such dividends and stock repurchases, will depend on, among other things, general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans, our financial results and condition, and contractual, legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us or our subsidiaries and our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. If the effective time of the merger occurs prior to the ex-dividend date with respect to a dividend that has been declared by our Board of Directors, then our stockholders immediately prior to the effective time of the merger would not be entitled to receive the previously declared dividend. We are a holding company and, as such, our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock is subject to the ability of our subsidiaries to provide us with cash. There can be no assurance that the current quarterly dividend level or the level of stock repurchases will be maintained or that we will pay any dividends or repurchase shares of common stock in any future period. Any change in the level of our dividends or stock repurchases or the suspension of the payment of dividends or stock repurchases could adversely affect our stock price.
