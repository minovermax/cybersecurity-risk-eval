If we are unable to mitigate and/or are exposed to any of the following risks in the future, then there could be a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nStrategic Risk\nThe truckload industry is affected by economic and business risks that are largely beyond our control.\nThe truckload industry is highly cyclical, and our business is dependent on a number of factors that may have a negative impact on our results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that some of the most significant of these factors are economic changes that affect supply and demand in transportation markets, such as:\n\u2022\nrecessionary economic cycles, such as the period from 2007 to 2009;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 inventory levels, including shrinking product/package sizes, and in the availability of funding for their working capital;\n\u2022\nexcess tractor capacity in comparison with shipping demand; and\n\u2022\ndownturns in customers\u2019 business cycles.\nThe risks associated with these factors are heightened when the United States economy is weakened. Some of the principal risks during such times, which we experienced during the recent recession, are as follows:\n\u2022\nlow overall freight levels, which may impair our asset utilization;\n\u2022\ncustomers with credit issues and cash flow problems;\n\u2022\nchanging freight patterns from redesigned supply chains, resulting in an imbalance between our capacity and customer demand;\n\u2022\ncustomers bidding out freight or selecting competitors that offer lower rates, in an attempt to lower their costs, forcing us to lower our rates or lose freight; and\n\u2022\nmore deadhead miles incurred to obtain loads.\nWe also are subject to cost increases outside our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently.\nIn addition, events outside our control, such as strikes or other work stoppages at our facilities or at customer, port, border, or other shipping locations, actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state, or heightened security requirements could lead to reduced economic demand, reduced availability of credit, or temporary closing of shipping locations or United States borders.\nThe truckload industry is highly competitive and fragmented, which subjects us to competitive pressures pertaining to pricing, capacity, and service.\nOur operating segments compete with many truckload carriers, and some LTL carriers, railroads, logistics, brokerage, freight forwarding, and other transportation companies. Additionally, some of our customers may utilize their own private fleets rather than outsourcing loads to us. Some of our competitors may have greater access to equipment, a wider range of services, greater capital resources, less indebtedness, or other competitive advantages. Numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain or improve our profitability. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nMany of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth in the economy. This may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase freight rates, or may require us to reduce our freight rates, or lose freight. Additionally, it may limit our ability to maintain or expand our business.\n\u2022\nSince some of our customers also operate their own private trucking fleets, they may decide to transport more of their own freight.\n\u2022\nSome shippers have selected core carriers for their shipping needs, for which we may not be selected.\n\u2022\nMany customers periodically solicit bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, which may depress freight rates or result in a loss of business to competitors.\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nSWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY\n\u2022\nThe continuing trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may result in more large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages, with which we may have difficulty competing.\n\u2022\nHigher fuel prices and higher fuel surcharges to our customers may cause some of our customers to consider freight transportation alternatives, including rail transportation.\n\u2022\nCompetition from freight logistics and brokerage companies may negatively impact our customer relationships and freight rates.\n\u2022\nSmaller carriers may build economies of scale with procurement aggregation providers, which may improve the smaller carriers\u2019 abilities to compete with us.\nOur company strategy includes pursuing selected acquisitions; however, we may not be able to execute or integrate future acquisitions successfully.\nHistorically, a key component of our growth strategy has been to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, for example, the Central Acquisition. Although we currently do not have any additional acquisition plans, we expect to consider acquisitions in the future. Current or future acquisition and integration of target companies may negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations because:\n\u2022\nThe business may not achieve anticipated revenue, earnings, or cash flows.\n\u2022\nWe may assume liabilities beyond our estimates or what was disclosed to us.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to integrate successfully and realize the anticipated economic, operational, and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical, or financial problems.\n\u2022\nThe acquisition could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management, and divert our resources.\n\u2022\nWe may have limited experience in the acquiree's market and may experience difficulties operating in its market.\n\u2022\nThere is a potential for loss of customers, employees, and drivers of the acquired company.\n\u2022\nWe may incur indebtedness or issue additional shares of stock.\nOperational Risk\nConsistent with industry trends, we face challenges with attracting and retaining qualified company drivers and owner-operators.\nRecent driver shortages have required, and could continue to require, us to spend more for hiring, including recruiting and advertising. Our challenge with attracting and retaining qualified drivers stems from intense market competition, which subjects us to increased payments for driver compensation and owner-operator contracted rates. In 2014 and 2015, we increased these rates to better attract and retain drivers. To the extent that the economy improves, we expect that we would need to continue to increase driver compensation and owner-operator contracted rates in order to remain competitive. Our high driver turnover rate (especially within 90 days of hire) requires us to continually recruit a substantial number of drivers in order to operate existing revenue equipment. If we do not attract and retain enough drivers, we could be forced to operate with fewer trucks. This would likely erode our size and profitability.\nOur contractual agreements with owner-operators expose us to risks that we do not face with our company drivers.\nOur financing subsidiaries offer financing to some of the owner-operators we contract with to purchase tractors from us. If these owner-operators default or experience a lease termination in conjunction with these agreements and we cannot replace them, we may incur losses on amounts owed to us. Also, if liquidity constraints or other restrictions prevent us from providing financing to the owner-operators we contract with in the future, then we could experience a shortage of owner-operators. This would be detrimental to our efforts to maximize our capacity contracted out to owner-operators.\nPursuant to our fuel reimbursement program with owner-operators, when fuel prices increase above a certain level, we share the cost with the owner-operators we contract with in order to mute the impact that increasing fuel prices may have on their business operations. A significant increase or rapid fluctuation in fuel prices could cause our reimbursement costs under this program to be higher than the revenue we receive under our customer fuel surcharge programs.\nOwner-operators are third-party service providers, as compared to company drivers, who are employed by Swift. As independent business owners, the owner-operators we contract with may make business or personal decisions that conflict with the best interests of Swift. For example, if a load is unprofitable, route distance is too far from home, personal scheduling conflicts arise, or for other reasons, owner-operators may deny loads of freight from time to time. In these circumstances, Swift must be able to timely deliver the freight in order to maintain relationships with customers.\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nSWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY\nWe depend on key personnel to manage our business and operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our executive officers, including Jerry Moyes (our founder and CEO), Richard Stocking (our President and COO), and Virginia Henkels (our CFO). Inadequate succession planning or unexpected departure of key executive officers could cause substantial disruption to our business operations, deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage. We do not currently have employment agreements with any of our management, including Mr. Moyes. We believe that the executive officers identified above possess valuable knowledge about the trucking industry and that their knowledge and relationships with our key customers and vendors would be very difficult to replicate. Although we believe we could replace key personnel, we may not be able to do so without incurring substantial costs.\nOur ability to offer intermodal and brokerage services could be limited if we experience performance instability from third parties we use in those businesses.\nOur intermodal business utilizes railroads and some third-party drayage carriers to transport freight for our customers. In most markets, rail service is limited to a few railroads or even a single railroad. Our ability to provide intermodal services in certain traffic lanes would be reduced or eliminated if the railroads' services became unstable. The cost of our rail-based services would likely increase, and the reliability, timeliness and overall attractiveness of these services would likely decrease. Furthermore, railroads increase shipping rates as market conditions permit. Price increases could result in higher costs to our customers and negatively impact the demand for our intermodal services. In addition, we may not be able to negotiate additional contracts with railroads to expand our capacity, add additional routes, or obtain multiple providers, which could limit our ability to provide this service.\nOur brokerage business is dependent upon the services of third-party capacity providers, including other truckload carriers. These third-party providers seek other freight opportunities and may require increased compensation in times of improved freight demand or tight trucking capacity. Our inability to secure the services of these third parties, or increases in the prices we must pay to secure such services, could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nWe are dependent on computer and communications systems; and a systems failure or data breach could cause a significant disruption to our business.\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems and infrastructure. We currently maintain our computer system at our Phoenix, Arizona headquarters, along with computer equipment at each of our terminals. Our operations and those of our technology and communications service providers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, Internet failures, computer viruses, data breaches (including cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware and the like) and other events generally beyond our control. We mitigate the risk of business interruption by maintaining redundant computer systems, redundant networks, and backup systems at alternative locations. However, these alternative locations are subject to some of the same interruptions that may affect the Phoenix headquarters. In the event of a significant system failure, our business could experience significant disruption.\nSeasonality, weather and other catastrophic events affect our operations and profitability.\nWe discuss seasonality and weather events that affect our business in Part I, Item 1, under \"Seasonality.\" These events and other catastrophic events may disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, damage or destroy our assets, or adversely affect the business or financial condition of our customers, any of which could harm our results or make our results more volatile.\nCompliance Risk\nSince our industry is highly regulated, we may inadvertently violate existing or future regulations or be adversely affected by changes to existing regulations.\nWe have the authority to operate in the continental United States (as granted by the DOT), Mexico (as granted by the Secretar\u00eda de Comunicaciones y Transportes), and various Canadian provinces (as granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications in such provinces). Our company, as well as our drivers and contracted owner-operators, must comply with enacted governmental regulations regarding safety, equipment, environmental protection, and operating methods. Examples include regulation of equipment weight, equipment dimensions, fuel emissions, driver hours-of-service, driver eligibility requirements, on-board reporting of operations, and ergonomics. We may also become subject to new or more restrictive regulations related to safety or operating methods. We discuss several proposed and pending regulations that could impact our operations in Part I, Item 1, under \"Environmental Regulation,\" \"Industry Regulation\" and \"Other Regulation.\"\nAdditionally, our lease contracts with owner-operators are governed by the federal leasing regulations, which impose specific requirements on us and the owner-operators. In the past, we have been the subject of lawsuits, alleging the violation of lease agreements or failure to follow the contractual terms. It is possible that we could be subjected to similar lawsuits in the future, which could result in added liability.\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nSWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY\nIf current or future legislation deems that owner-operators are equivalent to employees, we would incur more employee-related expenses.\nTax, federal, and other regulatory authorities have argued that owner-operators in the trucking industry are employees, rather than independent contractors. In April 2010, federal legislation was proposed that increased the recordkeeping requirements for companies that engage independent contractors and heightened the penalties to employers that misclassified individuals and violated overtime and/or wage requirements. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers\u2019 compensation, and income taxes, and a reclassification of owner-operators as employees would help states achieve this objective. Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against us and others in our industry seeking to reclassify owner-operators as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers\u2019 compensation and health care coverage. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. If the owner-operators we contract with are deemed employees, we would incur additional exposure under laws for federal and state tax, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort. The exposure could include prior period compensation, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.\nChanges in rules or legislation by the NLRB or Congress and/or organizing efforts by labor unions could result in litigation, divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAlthough our only collective bargaining agreement exists at our Mexican subsidiary, Trans-Mex, we always face the risk that our employees will try to unionize. If the owner-operators we contract with were ever re-classified as employees, the magnitude of this risk would increase. The NLRB, Congress or states could impose rules or legislation significantly affecting our business and our relationship with our employees. On December 12, 2014, the NLRB implemented a final rule amending the agency's representation-case proceedings which govern the procedures for union representation. Pursuant to this amendment, union elections can now be held within 10-21 days after the union requests a vote. These new rules make it easier for unions to successfully organize all employers, in all industries. Any attempt to organize by our employees could result in increased legal and other associated costs. In addition, if we entered into a collective bargaining agreement, the terms could negatively affect our costs, efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns on the affected operations.\nIn May of 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to grant certiorari to Appellees in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit case, Dilts, et al. v. Penske Logistics, LLC, et al. Consequently, the Appeals Court decision stands, holding that California state wage and hour laws are not preempted by federal law. As a result, the trucking industry has been confronted with a continuous patchwork of laws at the state and local levels, related to employee rest and meal breaks. Further, driver piece rate compensation, which is an industry standard, has been attacked as not being compliant with state minimum wage laws. Both of these issues are adversely impacting the Company and the motor carrier industry as a whole, with respect to the practical application of the laws; thereby resulting in additional cost. In its individual capacity, as well as participating with industry trade organizations, the Company supports and is actively pursuing legislative relief through Congress. The Company believes enacting legislation clarifying the preemptive scope of federal transportation law and regulations, as originally contemplated by Congress, would eliminate much of the current wage and hour confusion along with lessening the burden on interstate commerce. The passage of federal legislation involves the political process and is uncertain. Existing state and local laws, as well as new laws adopted in the future, which are not preempted by federal law, may result in increased labor costs, driver turnover, reduced operational efficiencies and amplified legal exposure.\nCSA rulemaking could adversely affect us, including our ability to maintain or grow our fleet, as well as our customer relationships.\nUnder CSA, drivers and fleets are evaluated and ranked based on certain safety-related standards. The current methodology for determining a carrier\u2019s DOT safety rating has been expanded, and as a result, certain current and potential drivers may no longer be eligible to drive for us. Additionally, our safety rating could be adversely affected. We recruit and retain a substantial number of first-time drivers. These drivers may have a higher likelihood of creating adverse safety events under CSA. A reduction in eligible drivers or a poor fleet ranking may result in difficulty attracting and retaining qualified drivers. This could cause our customers to transition to carriers with higher fleet rankings, and away from us.\nOur captive insurance companies are subject to substantial government regulation.\nOur captive insurance companies are regulated by state authorities. State regulations generally provide protection to policy holders, rather than stockholders, and generally involve:\n\u2022\napproval of premium rates for insurance;\n\u2022\nstandards of solvency;\n\u2022\nminimum amounts of statutory capital surplus that must be maintained;\n\u2022\nlimitations on types and amounts of investments;\n\u2022\nregulation of dividend payments and other transactions between affiliates;\n\u2022\nregulation of reinsurance;\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nSWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY\n\u2022\nregulation of underwriting and marketing practices;\n\u2022\napproval of policy forms;\n\u2022\nmethods of accounting; and\n\u2022\nfiling of annual and other reports with respect to financial condition and other matters.\nThese regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance, limit our ability to change premiums, restrict our ability to access cash held in our captive insurance companies, and otherwise impede our ability to take actions we deem advisable.\nWe are subject to certain risks arising from doing business in Mexico.\nWe have a growing operation in Mexico, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Trans-Mex, which subjects us to general international business risks, including:\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the economic strength of Mexico;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with a wide variety of international and Unites States export, import and business procurement laws; and\n\u2022\nsocial, political and economic instability.\nIn addition, if we are unable to maintain our C-TPAT status, we may have significant border delays. This could cause our Mexican operations to be less efficient than those of competitor truckload carriers that have C-TPAT status and operate in Mexico. We also face additional risks associated with our foreign operations, including restrictive trade policies and imposition of duties, taxes, or government royalties imposed by the Mexican government, to the extent not preempted by the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nFinancial Risk\nA material portion of our revenue is concentrated in a group of major customers. As such, we would be adversely affected if we lost one or more of these major customers.\nOur revenue is concentrated in a group of major customers, as discussed in Part I, Item 1, under \"Customers and Marketing.\" Retail and discount retail customers account for a substantial portion of our freight, creating a dependency on consumer spending and retail sales for us. Given this, our results may be more susceptible to trends in unemployment and retail sales than carriers that do not have this concentration.\nEconomic conditions and capital markets may adversely affect our customers and their ability to remain solvent. Our customers\u2019 financial difficulties can negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition if they were to curtail their operations or delay or default on their payments to us. Aside from our Dedicated segment, we generally do not have contractual relationships that guarantee any minimum volumes with our customers, and we cannot provide assurance that our customer relationships will continue. Our Dedicated segment is generally subject to longer-term written contracts than our Truckload segment business; however, certain of these contracts contain cancellation clauses. There is no assurance that any of our customers will continue to utilize our services, renew our existing contracts, or continue at the same volume levels.\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements that necessitate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtaining financing on favorable terms.\nThe truckload industry is capital intensive. Historically, we have depended on cash from operations, borrowings from banks and finance companies, issuances of notes, and leasing activities to expand the size of our terminal network and upgrade and expand the size of our revenue equipment fleet.\nCredit markets are likely to weaken again at some point in the future, which would make it difficult for us to access our current sources of credit and difficult for our lenders to find the capital to fund us. We may need to incur additional debt, or issue debt or equity securities in the future, to refinance existing debt, fund working capital requirements, make investments, or support other business activities. Declines in consumer confidence, decreases in domestic spending, economic contractions and other trends in the credit market may impair our future ability to secure financing on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nIn the future, we could face inabilities with generating sufficient cash from operations, obtaining sufficient financing on favorable terms, or maintaining compliance with financial and other covenants in our financing agreements. If any of these events occur, then we may face liquidity constraints, be forced to enter into less favorable financing arrangements, or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods of time. Additionally, such events could adversely impact our ability to provide services to our customers.\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nSWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY\nBecause our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel, fluctuations in price or availability, volume and terms of purchase commitments, and surcharge collection could materially increase our costs of operation.\nAlthough fuel prices have recently decreased, fuel is one of our largest operating expenses. Diesel fuel prices greatly fluctuate due to factors entirely beyond our control, such as political events, terrorist activities, armed conflicts, and depreciation of the dollar against other currencies. Hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters, such as the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, tend to lead to an increase in the cost of fuel. Rising demand, matched with falling supply of fuel, adversely impacts the price. Examples include rising demand in developing countries like China, diminishing supply from less drilling activity, and sharing supply with industries using crude oil and oil reserves for other purposes. These events may lead to fuel shortages and disruptions in the fuel supply chain.\nFuel is also subject to regional pricing differences and often costs more on the West Coast and in the Northeast, where we have significant operations. Increases in fuel costs, to the extent not offset by rate-per-mile increases or fuel surcharges, have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability. We obtain some protection against fuel cost increases by maintaining a fuel-efficient fleet and compensatory fuel surcharge programs with the vast majority of our customers. These fuel surcharge programs have historically helped us offset the majority of any negative impacts of rising fuel prices associated with loaded or billed miles. Our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices. As such, it may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially when prices are rising. This leads to fluctuation in our levels of reimbursement, which has occurred in the past. During periods of low freight volumes, shippers can use their negotiating leverage to impose less robust fuel surcharge policies. We cannot ensure that such fuel surcharges will be indefinitely maintained or sufficiently effective. Additionally, there are certain fuel costs that we cannot recover, despite our fuel surcharge programs, such as those associated with deadhead miles and engine idling time.\nWe have not historically used derivatives to mitigate volatility in our fuel costs, but periodically evaluate the benefits of employing this strategy. To mitigate the impact of rising fuel costs, we contract with some of our fuel suppliers to buy fuel at a fixed price or within banded pricing for a specified period, usually not exceeding twelve months. However, these purchase commitments only cover a small portion of our fuel consumption. Accordingly, fuel price fluctuations may still negatively impact us.\nWe operate a modern fleet of tractors, some of which are leased or financed. This subjects us to costs associated with increasing equipment prices, new engine design changes, volatility in the used equipment sales market, and the failure of manufacturers to meet their sale or trade-back obligations.\nOur modern fleet of tractors gives us a competitive advantage in many ways. However, there are also disadvantages we face from obtaining newer equipment. For example, engines used in tractors manufactured in 2010 and after are subject to more stringent emissions control regulations issued by the EPA. We have paid higher prices for new tractors over the past few years as a result of complying with these regulations, while the resale and residual values have not increased to the same extent. Accordingly, our equipment costs, including depreciation expense per tractor, are expected to increase in future periods. To comply with the EPA\u2019s 2010 diesel engine emissions standards, many engine manufacturers are using special equipment that needs diesel exhaust fluid. If we purchase new tractors that have this special equipment, we will be exposed to additional costs associated with price and availability of diesel exhaust fluid, the weight of the equipment, maintenance, and training our drivers to use the equipment.\nWe have certain revenue equipment leases and financing arrangements with balloon payments at the end of the lease term equal to the residual value the Company is contracted to receive from certain equipment manufacturers upon sale or trade back to the manufacturers. If we do not purchase new equipment that triggers the trade-back obligation, or the equipment manufacturers do not pay the contracted value at the end of the lease term, we could be exposed to losses equal to the excess of the balloon payment owed to the lease or finance company over the proceeds from selling the equipment on the open market. In addition, if we purchase equipment subject to a buy-back agreement and the manufacturer refuses to honor the agreement, or we are unable to replace equipment at a reasonable price, we may be forced to sell the equipment at a loss.\nUsed equipment prices are subject to substantial fluctuations based on freight demand, supply of used trucks, availability of financing, presence of buyers for export to countries such as Russia and Brazil, and commodity prices for scrap metal. These and any impacts of a depressed market for used equipment could require us to trade our revenue equipment below the carrying value. This leads to losses on disposal or impairments of revenue equipment, when not otherwise protected by residual value arrangements. Deteriorations of resale prices or trades at depressed values could cause more losses on disposal or impairment charges in future periods.\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total outstanding long-term debt, including outstanding borrowings on the New Revolver and 2015 RSA, but excluding capital lease obligations was $1.1 billion. Since we are substantially leveraged, we could be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged. This could have negative consequences that include:\n\u2022\nincreased vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments;\n\u2022\ncash flows from operations that are committed to payment of principal and interest, thereby reducing our ability to use cash for our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nSWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY\n\u2022\nincreased interest rates that would affect our variable rate debt;\n\u2022\nnoncompliance with restrictive covenants, borrowing conditions, and other debt obligations, which could result in an event of default;\n\u2022\nnon-strategic divestitures or inability to make strategic acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlack of financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimits on our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business, market conditions, or in the economy.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nAs detailed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, our senior secured credit facility agreement requires compliance with various affirmative, negative, and financial covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in default or (when applicable) cross-default. Upon default under our senior secured credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all outstanding amounts to be immediately due and payable, as well as terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such actions by those lenders could cause cross defaults with our other debt agreements. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could secure the debt with the collateral granted to them. If the lenders accelerated our debt repayments, we might not have sufficient assets to repay all amounts borrowed.\nIn addition, our 2015 RSA includes certain restrictive covenants and cross default provisions with respect to our senior secured credit facility. Failure to comply with these covenants and provisions may jeopardize our ability to continue to sell receivables under the facility and could negatively impact our liquidity.\nInsuring risk through our captive insurance companies could adversely impact our operations.\nWe insure a significant portion of our risk through our captive insurance companies, Mohave and Red Rock. In addition to insuring portions of our own risk, Mohave provides reinsurance coverage to third-party insurance companies associated with our affiliated companies' owner-operators. Red Rock insures a share of our automobile liability risk. The insurance and reinsurance markets are subject to market pressures. Our captive insurance companies\u2019 abilities or needs to access the reinsurance markets may involve the retention of additional risk, which could expose us to volatility in claims expenses.\nTo comply with certain state insurance regulatory requirements, cash and cash equivalents must be paid to Red Rock and Mohave as capital investments and insurance premiums, to be restricted as collateral for anticipated losses. The restricted cash is used for payment of insured claims. In the future, we may continue to insure our automobile liability risk through our captive insurance subsidiaries, which will cause increases in the required amount of our restricted cash or other collateral, such as letters of credit. Significant increases in the amount of collateral required by third-party insurance carriers and regulators would reduce our liquidity.\nWe face risks related to self-insurance and third-party insurance that can be volatile to our earnings.\nWe self-insure a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses for cargo loss, bodily injury, workers\u2019 compensation and property damage, and maintain insurance with insurance companies above our limits of self-insurance. Self-insurance retention and other limitations are detailed in Part I, Item 1, under \"Safety and Insurance.\" Our large self-insured retention limits can make our insurance and claims expense higher or more volatile. Additionally, if our third-party insurance carriers or underwriters leave the trucking sector, it could materially increase our insurance costs or collateral requirements, or create difficulties in finding insurance in excess of our self-insured retention limits.\nWe accrue for the costs of the uninsured portion of pending claims, based on the nature and severity of individual claims and historical claims development trends. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts is inherently difficult. This, along with legal expenses, incurred but not reported claims, and other uncertainties can cause unfavorable differences between actual self-insurance costs and our reserve estimates. We try to limit our exposure to claims that ultimately prove to be more severe than originally assessed. However, this may not be possible if carrier subcontractors under our brokerage operations are inadequately insured for any accident.\nAlthough we believe our aggregate insurance limits are sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed those limits. In this case, we would bear the excess expense, in addition to the amount of self-insurance. Our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we could find it necessary to raise our self-insured retention or decrease our aggregate coverage limits when our policies are renewed or replaced.\nOur stock price has recently declined and could continue to decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. These sales also could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity- related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nSWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have approximately 87.8 million outstanding shares of Class A common stock, assuming no exercise of options outstanding as of the date of this report and approximately 51.0 million outstanding shares of Class B common stock that are convertible into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock. All of the Class A shares are freely tradable, except that any shares owned by \"affiliates\" (as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) may only be sold in compliance with the limitations described in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nIn addition, we have an aggregate of 4.9 million shares and 1.8 million shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuances under our 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan and our 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, respectively. Issuances of Class A common stock to our directors, executive officers and employees through exercise of stock options under our stock plans, or purchases by our executive officers and employees through our 2012 ESPP, dilute a stockholder's interest in Swift.\nWe could determine that our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles are impaired, thus recognizing a related loss.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had goodwill of $253.3 million and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $181.0 million primarily from the 2007 Transactions. We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with the accounting policies discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Our evaluations in 2015, 2014 and 2013 produced no indication of impairment. We could recognize impairments in the future, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. If these events occur, our profitability and financial condition will suffer.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our Class A common stock or Class B common stock.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our Class A common stock or Class B common stock in the near future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings, if any, for use in the development and expansion of our business, the repayment of debt, our repurchase of our Class A common stock, and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends and other distributions in cash, stock, or property by Swift in the future will be at the discretion of our Board and will be dependent on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition and results of operations, contractual restrictions, such as restrictive covenants contained in our senior secured credit facility, capital requirements, and other factors.\nConflict of Interest Risk\nOur controlling shareholder and CEO, along with the Moyes Affiliates, control a large portion of our stock and have substantial control over us, which could limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including changes of control.\nOur CEO, Mr. Moyes, and the Moyes Affiliates beneficially own approximately 39% of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Moyes and the Moyes Affiliates beneficially own 100% of our Class B common stock and approximately 3% of our Class A common stock. On all matters with respect to which our stockholders have a right to vote, including the election of directors, the holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share, and the holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to two votes per share. All outstanding shares of Class B common stock are convertible to Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis at the election of the holders thereof, or automatically upon transfer to someone other than Mr. Moyes or the Moyes Affiliates.\nThis voting structure gives Mr. Moyes and the Moyes Affiliates approximately 55% of the voting power of all of our outstanding stock as of December 31, 2015. Furthermore, due to our dual class structure, Mr. Moyes and the Moyes Affiliates are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval even though they own less than 50% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our Class A common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Also, these stockholders can exert significant influence over our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations, or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation, or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if other stockholders perceived that change of control to be beneficial.\nBecause Mr. Moyes and the Moyes Affiliates control a majority of the voting power of our common stock, we qualify as a \"controlled company\" as defined by the NYSE and as such, we may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of this stock exchange. We do not currently intend to utilize these exemptions, but may choose to do so in the future.\nMr. Moyes has borrowed against and pledged a portion of his Class B common stock, which may cause a conflict of interests between him and our other stockholders, and adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nCactus II Pledging - In July 2011 and December 2011, Cactus Holding Company II, LLC (\"Cactus II\"), an entity controlled by Mr. Moyes, pledged 12,023,343 shares of Class B common stock on margin as collateral for personal loan arrangements entered into by Cactus II and relating to Mr. Moyes. In connection with these December 2011 transactions, Cactus II converted 6,553,253 of the 12,023,343 pledged shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. During\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nSWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY\n2012, the Moyes Affiliates converted an additional 1,068,224 shares of Class B common stock to Class A common stock and sold 4,831,878 of these pledged Class A shares to a counter-party pursuant to a sale and repurchase agreement with a full recourse obligation to repurchase the securities at the same price on the fourth anniversary of sale. As of December 31, 2015, the Moyes Affiliates had pledged on margin 9,140,167 shares, of which 6,550,090 were Class B and 2,590,077 were Class A common stock. These pledged shares could cause Mr. Moyes\u2019 interest to conflict with the interests of our other stockholders and could result in the future sale of such shares. Such sales could adversely affect the trading price or otherwise disrupt the market for our Class A common stock.\nM Capital II VPF - In addition to the shares that were allowed to be pledged on margin pursuant to our second amended and restated securities trading policy, on October 29, 2013, an affiliate of Mr. Moyes (\"M Capital II\") entered into a VPF contract with Citibank, N.A. that was intended to facilitate settlement of the 2010 METS, issued in 2010 by an unaffiliated trust concurrently with the Company\u2019s IPO, which was required to be settled with shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock, or cash, on December 31, 2013. This transaction effectively replaced the 2010 METS with the VPF contract and allowed the parties to the 2010 METS transaction to satisfy their obligations under the 2010 METS (as contemplated by their terms) without reducing the number of shares owned by these parties. The VPF transaction allowed Mr. Moyes and certain of his affiliates, through their ownership of M Capital II, to participate in future price appreciation of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, and retain the voting power of the shares collateralized to secure the VPF contract. Under the VPF contract, M Capital II was obligated to deliver to Citibank a variable amount of stock or cash during two twenty trading day periods beginning on January 4, 2016, and July 5, 2016, respectively.\nAmended M Capital II VPF and Cactus VPF - On October 30, 2015, M Capital II and another Moyes Affiliate, Cactus Holding I, entered into the Amended M Capital II VPF and the Cactus VPF, respectively. The purposes of these two VPF contracts were to (i) extend the maturity date of M Capital II\u2019s then-existing VPF with Citibank N.A. (discussed above) and (ii) generate cash proceeds for the repayment of certain stock-secured obligations of Cactus Holding II, a Moyes Affiliate, and thereby effect the release of certain shares of Class B Common Stock pledged in connection with the same.\nCactus Holding I entered into the Cactus VPF contract in respect of 3,300,000 shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock, which were pledged by Cactus Holding I as security for its obligations under the Cactus VPF contract. Under the Cactus VPF contract, Cactus Holding I is required to deliver to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (\"CGMI\") a variable amount of stock or cash during a three trading day period at the maturity of the contract on November 21, 2016 through November 24, 2016. In connection with the Cactus VPF contract, Cactus Holding I received $48.3 million from CGMI.\nIn connection with the Amended M Capital II VPF, M Capital II paid Citibank N.A $18.5 million. The source of these funds was a cash payment from CGMI in connection with the Cactus VPF Contract. Under the Amended M Capital II VPF contract, M Capital II is required to deliver to Citibank N.A. a variable amount of stock or cash during a three trading day period at the maturity of the contract on November 21, 2016 through November 24, 2016. The number of shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock subject to the Amended M Capital VPF remains unchanged at 13,700,000.\nThe Amended M Capital II VPF and the Cactus VPF contracts allow Mr. Moyes and the Moyes Affiliates to retain the same number of shares and voting percentage as they had prior to these VPF contracts. In addition, Mr. Moyes and the Moyes Affiliates are able to participate in any price appreciation of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Amended M Capital II VPF Contract generally permits M Capital II to participate in any price appreciation in the Company\u2019s common stock between $22.00 and $26.40 per share. Under the then-existing VPF, M Capital II was generally permitted to participate in any price appreciation in the Company's common stock between $22.54 and $34.00 per share. The Cactus VPF Contract generally permits Cactus Holding I to participate in any price appreciation in the Company's common stock between $22.00 and $26.40 per share.\nIn connection with the Amended M Capital II VPF transaction, 25,994,016 shares of Class B Common Stock are collateralized by Citibank, N.A. to secure M Capital II\u2019s obligations under the VPF Contract. As these shares are not pledged to secure a loan on margin, they are not subject to the securities trading policy limitation discussed below. Although M Capital II may settle its obligations to Citibank N.A. in cash, any or all of the collateralized shares could be converted into Class A common stock and delivered on such dates to settle such obligations. Such transfers of our common stock, or the perception that they may occur, may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock and may create conflicts of interest for Mr. Moyes.\nMargin Pledging Limitations - The Company has a securities trading policy (\"STP\") that includes, among other things, limitations on the pledging of Company stock on margin. As disclosed at the time of our IPO, under the STP, directors, senior executive officers (including the CEO) and compliance officers were not permitted to pledge more than 20% of their family stock holdings for margin loans. In July 2013, the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board approved revisions to the STP to further limit pledging of stock on margin, under which, effective July 1, 2014, the limitation was reduced to 15% of family stock holdings and was scheduled to be reduced to 10% of family stock holdings as of July 1, 2015.\nIn June 2015, our CEO reported to the independent chairman of the board that he was in compliance with the limitation on pledging stock on margin and was working to reduce the amount pledged on margin to below the 10% limit scheduled to take effect, but needed until November 2015 to do so in an orderly fashion. Following Board discussion of these circumstances, the Board amended the STP so that the 15% limit would remain in effect through November 30, 2015 and the 10% limit would take effect on December 1, 2015.\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nSWIFT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY\nIn October 2015, our CEO informed the Company that due to the drop in the stock price he had pledged additional shares of Company stock on margin in August and September 2015, in contravention of the STP, and that the percentage of family stock holdings pledged on margin was in excess of the 15% limit. He was precluded from selling shares during this time since he was in possession of material non-public information.\nThe independent members of the Board met and considered these events in light of competing concerns. On the one hand, the policy and limitations on pledging stock on margin were intended to avoid the risks of stock being sold to satisfy a margin call at a time when Company insiders might have material nonpublic information. On the other hand, unwinding margin positions in significant amounts in a short period could generate adverse market perceptions concerning the Company and the stock. In addition, the Board sought additional information regarding the CEO\u2019s plans to reduce the level of stock pledged on margin.\nIn response to these developments and the competing concerns identified, the Board directed the CEO to reduce the level of stock pledged on margin to 15% or less of family holdings no later than November 4, 2015 and determined to waive compliance with the 10% limit (but not the 15% limit) through December 31, 2016 so that the margin positions could be reduced in an orderly fashion. In addition, the Board formally reprimanded the CEO and imposed sanctions.\nThe Company's recent stock volatility has necessitated Mr. Moyes to increase the level of Company stock pledged on margin; thereby exceeding the 15% limit. Taking into account various competing concerns, on December 18, 2015, the Board determined to waive compliance with the 15% limit (but not the 20% limit) through December 31, 2016 to allow Mr. Moyes to reduce the margin position in an orderly manner.\nWe engage in transactions with other businesses controlled by our CEO, Jerry Moyes. This could create conflicts of interest between Mr. Moyes and our other stockholders.\nWe engage in various transactions with companies controlled by and/or affiliated with related parties. These transactions include freight services, facility leasing, air transportation, and other services provided by and/or received by Swift with entities affiliated with Mr. Moyes. Because certain entities controlled by Mr. Moyes and certain members of his family operate in the transportation industry, Mr. Moyes\u2019 ownership may create conflicts of interest or require judgments that are disadvantageous to our stockholders in the event we compete for the same freight or other business opportunities. As a result, Mr. Moyes may have interests that conflict with our stockholders.\nWe have adopted a policy that requires prior approval of related party transactions. Additionally, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that specifically relate to prior approval of related party transactions with Mr. Moyes, the Moyes Affiliates, and any Moyes affiliated entities. However, we cannot provide assurance that the policy or these provisions will be successful in eliminating conflicts of interest. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that in the event that any Swift officer or director is also an officer, director or employee of an entity owned by (or affiliated with) Mr. Moyes (or any Moyes Affiliate) and acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or other corporate opportunity not involving the transportation industry or involving refrigerated or LTL transportation, then, subject to certain exceptions, we shall not be entitled to such transaction or corporate opportunity and there should be no expectancy that such transaction or corporate opportunity will be available to us.\nMr. Moyes, our CEO, has substantial ownership interests in and guarantees related to several other businesses and real estate investments, which may expose Mr. Moyes to significant lawsuits or liabilities.\nIn addition to being our CEO and principal stockholder, Mr. Moyes is the principal stakeholder of, and serves as chairman of the board of directors of SME Industries, Inc., a steel erection and fabrication company, Southwest Premier Properties, LLC, a real estate management company, and is involved in other business endeavors in a variety of industries and has made substantial real estate investments. Although Mr. Moyes devotes the substantial majority of his time to his role as CEO of Swift, the breadth of Mr. Moyes\u2019 other interests may place competing demands on his time and attention.\nIn addition, in one instance of litigation arising from another business owned by Mr. Moyes, Swift was named as a defendant even though Swift was not a party to the transactions that were the subject of the litigation. It is possible that litigation relating to other businesses owned by Mr. Moyes in the future may result in Swift being named as a defendant and, even if such claims are without merit, that we will be required to incur the expense of defending such matters. In many instances, Mr. Moyes has given personal guarantees to lenders to the various businesses and real estate investments in which he has an ownership interest and, in certain cases, the underlying loans are in default and are in the process of being restructured and/or settled. If Mr. Moyes is otherwise unable to settle or raise the necessary amount of proceeds to satisfy his obligations to such lenders, he may be subject to significant lawsuits, and expose his shares of stock to creditors.", "PERMNO": 80987, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "KNX"}
