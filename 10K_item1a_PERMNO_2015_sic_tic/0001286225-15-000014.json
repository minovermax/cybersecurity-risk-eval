Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may be due to a number of factors, including the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this filing. Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n\u2022\nthe extent to which on demand software solutions maintain current and achieve broader market acceptance;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in leasing activity by our customers;\n\u2022\nincrease in the number or severity of insurance claims on policies sold by us;\n\u2022\nour ability to timely introduce enhancements to our existing solutions and new solutions;\n\u2022\nour ability to renew the use of our on demand products and services by units managed by our existing customers and to increase the use of our on demand products and services for the management of units by our existing and new customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors or new competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in local economic, political and regulatory environments of our international operations;\n\u2022\nthe variable nature of our sales and implementation cycles;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions in the rental housing industry that impact our current and potential customers;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of our investment in research and development activities;\n\u2022\ntechnical difficulties, service interruptions, data or document losses or security breaches;\n\u2022\nInternet usage trends among consumers and the methodologies Internet search engines utilize to direct those consumers to websites such as our LeaseStar product family;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire and retain qualified key personnel, including the rate of expansion of our sales force and IT department;\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate and adapt to external forces and emergence of new technologies and products;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into new markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in the legal, regulatory or compliance environment related to the rental housing industry or the markets in which we operate, including without limitation fair credit reporting, payment processing, data protection and privacy, social media, utility billing, insurance, the Internet and e-commerce, licensing, telemarketing, electronic communications, the Health Insurance Portability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and the Health Information Technology Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d);\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue and expenses related to recent and potential acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or technologies;\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate acquisition operations in a cost-effective and timely manner;\n\u2022\nlitigation and settlement costs, including unforeseen costs;\n\u2022\npublic company reporting requirements; and\n\u2022\nnew accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting standards or practices, particularly any affecting the recognition of subscription revenue or accounting for mergers and acquisitions.\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results or guidance that we provide may lead analysts to change their long-term model for valuing our common stock, cause us to face short-term liquidity issues, impact our ability to retain or attract key personnel or cause other unanticipated issues, all of which could cause our stock price to decline. As a result of the potential\nvariations in our quarterly revenue and operating results, we believe that quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date period comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have not been consistently profitable on a quarterly or annual basis and may not be able to continue our revenue growth or increase our profitability in the future. We expect to make significant future expenditures related to the development and expansion of our business. As a result of increased general and administrative expenses due to the additional operational and reporting costs associated with being a public company, we need to generate and sustain increased revenue to achieve future profitability expectations. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks and uncertainties described in this filing. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If these losses exceed our expectations or our growth expectations are not met in future periods, our financial performance will be affected adversely.\nIf we are unable to manage the growth of our diverse and complex operations, our financial performance may suffer.\nThe growth in the size, dispersed geographic locations, complexity and diversity of our business and the expansion of our product lines and customer base has placed, and our anticipated growth may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We increased our number of employees from 922 as of December 31, 2008 to 3,875 as of December 31, 2014. We increased our number of on demand customers from 2,669 as of December 31, 2008 to approximately 10,700 as of December 31, 2014. In addition, we have grown and expect to continue to grow through acquisitions. Our ability to effectively manage our anticipated future growth will depend on, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully supporting and maintaining a broad range of current and emerging solutions;\n\u2022\nmaintaining continuity in our senior management and key personnel;\n\u2022\nattracting, retaining, training and motivating our employees, particularly technical, customer service and sales personnel;\n\u2022\nenhancing our financial and accounting systems and controls;\n\u2022\nenhancing our information technology infrastructure, processes and controls;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully completing system upgrades and enhancements; and\n\u2022\nmanaging expanded operations in geographically dispersed locations.\nIf we do not manage the size, complexity and diverse nature of our business effectively, we could experience product performance issues, delayed software releases and longer response times for assisting our customers with implementation of our solutions and could lack adequate resources to support our customers on an ongoing basis, any of which could adversely affect our reputation in the market and our ability to generate revenue from new or existing customers.\nThe nature of our platform is complex and highly integrated, and if we fail to successfully manage releases or integrate new solutions, it could harm our revenues, operating income and reputation.\nWe manage a complex platform of solutions that consists of our property management solutions, integrated software-enabled value-added services and web-based advertising and lease generation services. Many of our solutions include a large number of product centers that are highly integrated and require interoperability with other RealPage products, as well as products and services of third-party service providers. Additionally, we typically deploy new releases of the software underlying our on demand software solutions on a bi-weekly, monthly or quarterly schedule, depending on the solution. Due to this complexity and the condensed development cycles under which we operate, we may experience errors in our software, corruption or loss of our data or unexpected performance issues from time to time. For example, our solutions may face interoperability difficulties with software operating systems or programs being used by our customers, or new releases, upgrades, fixes or the integration of acquired technologies may have unanticipated consequences on the operation and performance of our other solutions. If we encounter integration challenges or discover errors in our solutions late in our development cycle, it may cause us to delay our launch dates. Any major integration or interoperability issues or launch delays could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income and reputation.\nOur business depends substantially on the renewal of our products and services for on demand units managed by our customers and the increase in the use of our on demand products and services for on demand units.\nWith the exception of some of our LeaseStar and Propertyware solutions, which are typically month-to-month, we generally license our solutions pursuant to customer agreements with a term of one year. The pricing of the agreements is typically based on a price per unit basis. Our customers have no obligation to renew these agreements after their term expires, or to renew these agreements at the same or higher annual contract value. In addition, under specific circumstances, our\ncustomers have the right to cancel their customer agreements before they expire, for example, in the event of an uncured breach by us, or in some circumstances, by giving 30 days\u2019 notice or paying a cancellation fee. In addition, customers often purchase a higher level of professional services in the initial term than they do in renewal terms to ensure successful activation. As a result, our ability to grow is dependent in part on customers purchasing additional solutions or professional services for their on demand units after the initial term of their customer agreement. Though we maintain and analyze historical data with respect to rates of customer renewals, upgrades and expansions, those rates may not accurately predict future trends in renewal of on demand units. Our customers\u2019 on demand unit renewal rates may decline or fluctuate for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, their level of satisfaction with our solutions, our pricing, our competitors\u2019 pricing, reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels or reductions in the number of on demand units managed by our customers. If our customers cancel or amend their agreements with us during their term, do not renew their agreements, renew on less favorable terms or do not purchase additional solutions or professional services in renewal periods, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our profitability may be harmed.\nAdditionally, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, some level of on demand unit attrition as properties are sold and the new owners and managers of properties previously owned or managed by our customers do not continue to use our solutions. We cannot predict the amount of on demand unit turnover we will experience in the future. However, we have experienced higher rates of on demand unit attrition with our Propertyware property management system, primarily because it serves smaller properties than our OneSite property management system, and we may experience higher levels of on demand unit attrition to the extent Propertyware grows as a percentage of our revenues. If we experience increased on demand unit turnover, our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOn demand revenue that is derived from products that help owners and managers lease and market apartments, such as certain products in LeaseStar and LeasingDesk, may decrease as occupancy rates rise. We have also experienced, and expect to continue to experience, some number of consolidations of our customers with other parties. If one of our customers consolidates with a party who is not a customer, our customer may decide not to continue to use our solutions for its on demand units. In addition, if one of our customers is consolidated with another customer, the acquiring customer may have negotiated lower prices for our solutions or may use fewer of our solutions than the acquired customer. In each case, the consolidated entity may attempt to negotiate lower prices for using our solutions as a result of the entity\u2019s increased size. These consolidations may cause us to lose on demand units or require us to reduce prices as a result of enhanced customer leverage, which could cause our financial performance and operating results to be adversely affected.\nHistorically, our on demand units managed by our customers have renewed at a rate of 95.3% based on an average of the last two years ending December 31, 2014.\nBecause we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the applicable customer agreement, a decline in subscription renewals or new service agreements may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their customer agreements which, with the exception of our month-to-month advertising, lease generation and Propertyware agreements, are typically one year. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from customer agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed customer agreements in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue or our results of operations until future periods. Accordingly, this revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nWe may not be able to continue to add new customers and retain and increase sales to our existing customers, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur revenue growth is dependent on our ability to continually attract new customers while retaining and expanding our service offerings to existing customers. Growth in the demand for our solutions may be inhibited and we may be unable to sustain growth in our sales for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour failure to develop new or additional solutions;\n\u2022\nour inability to market our solutions in a cost-effective manner to new customers or in new vertical or geographic markets;\n\u2022\nour inability to expand our sales to existing customers;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our LeaseStar product family to grow traffic to its websites, resulting in lower levels of lead and lease/move-in traffic to customers;\n\u2022\nour inability to build and promote our brand; and\n\u2022\nperceived or actual security, integrity, reliability, quality or compatibility problems with our solutions.\nA substantial amount of our past revenue growth was derived from purchases of upgrades and additional solutions by existing customers. Our costs associated with increasing revenue from existing customers are generally lower than costs associated with generating revenue from new customers. Therefore, a reduction in the rate of revenue increase from our existing customers, even if offset by an increase in revenue from new customers, could reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we are not able to integrate past or future acquisitions successfully, our operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nWe have acquired new technology and domain expertise through multiple acquisitions, including our most recent acquisitions of Seniors for Living, Inc. in February 2013; RentSentinel and RentSocial in March 2013; Windsor Compliance Services, Inc., MyBuilding Inc., and Active Building, LLC in October 2013; Bookt, LLC in January 2014; Virtual Maintenance Manager in March 2014; Notivus Multi-Family LLC in May 2014; and Kigo, Inc. in June 2014. We expect to continue making acquisitions. The success of our future acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and any acquisitions we complete may not be successful. Any acquisitions we pursue would involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating and managing the operations and technologies of the companies we acquire;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our business;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain the customers, the key employees, the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nour inability to generate sufficient revenue from acquisitions to offset our increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, including, without limitation, liabilities arising out of their failure to maintain effective data security, data integrity, disaster recovery and privacy controls prior to the acquisition, or their infringement or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property, contract or data access rights prior to the acquisition;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in complying with new markets or regulatory standards to which we were not previously subject;\n\u2022\ndelays in our ability to implement internal standards, controls, procedures and policies in the businesses we acquire; and\n\u2022\nadverse effects of acquisition activity on the key performance indicators we use to monitor our performance as a business.\nOur current acquisition strategy includes the acquisition of companies that offer property management systems or other systems that may not inter-operate with our software-enabled value-added services. In order to integrate and fully realize the benefits of such acquisitions, we expect to build application interfaces that enable such customers to use a wide range of our solutions while they continue to use their legacy management systems. In addition, over time we expect to migrate each acquired company\u2019s customers to our on demand property management solutions to retain them as customers and to be in a position to offer them our solutions on a cost-effective basis. These efforts may be unsuccessful or entail costs that result in losses or reduced profitability.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances occurring in future periods may affect the realizability of our intangible assets recognized through acquisitions. The events and circumstances that we consider include significant under-performance relative to projected future operating results and significant changes in our overall business or product strategies. These events and circumstances may cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and any such revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results.\nWe may be unable to secure the equity or debt funding necessary to finance future acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders will likely experience ownership dilution, and if we finance future acquisitions with debt funding, we will incur interest expense and may have to comply with additional financing covenants or secure that debt obligation with our assets.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop or acquire and sell enhancements and new solutions, our revenue growth will be harmed and we may not be able to meet profitability expectations.\nThe industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing customer requirements, technological developments and evolving industry standards. Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend in large part on our ability to successfully develop, bring to market and sell enhancements to our existing solutions and new solutions that effectively respond to the rapid changes in our industry. Any enhancements or new solutions that we develop or acquire may not be introduced to the market in a timely or cost-effective manner and may not\nachieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate the revenue required to offset the operating expenses and capital expenditures related to development or acquisition. If we are unable to timely develop or acquire and sell enhancements and new solutions that keep pace with the rapid changes in our industry, our revenue will not grow as expected and we may not be able to maintain or meet profitability expectations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of our solutions and failure to maintain demand for these solutions or diversify our revenue base through increasing demand for our other solutions could negatively affect our operating results.\nHistorically, a majority of our revenue was derived from sales of our OneSite property management system and our LeasingDesk software-enabled value-added service. If we are unable to develop enhancements to these solutions to maintain demand for these solutions or to diversify our revenue base by increasing demand for our other solutions, our operating results could be negatively impacted. If there is inadequate demand for these new products, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nWe use a small number of data centers to deliver our solutions. Any disruption of service at our data centers or other facilities could interrupt or delay our customers\u2019 access to our solutions, which could harm our operating results.\nThe ability of our customers to access our service is critical to our business. We host our products and services, support our operations and service our customers primarily from our data centers in the Dallas, Texas area.\nWe may fail to provide such service as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: mechanical failure, power outage, human error, physical or electronic security breaches, war, terrorism and related conflicts or similar events worldwide, fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood and other natural disasters, sabotage and vandalism. We attempt to mitigate these risks at our Texas-based data centers or other facilities through various business continuity efforts, including: redundant infrastructure, 24 x 7 x 365 system activity monitoring, backup and recovery procedures, use of a secure off-site storage facility for backup media, separate test systems and rotation of management and system security measures, but our precautions may not protect against all potential problems. Disaster recovery procedures are in place to facilitate the recovery of our operations, products and services within the stated service level goals. Our secondary data center is equipped with physical space, power, storage and networking infrastructure and Internet connectivity to support the solutions we provide in the event of the interruption of services at our primary data center. Even with this secondary data center, however, our operations would be interrupted during the transition process should our primary data center experience a failure. Moreover, both our primary and secondary data centers are located in the greater metropolitan Dallas area. As a result, any regional disaster could affect both data centers and result in a material disruption of our services. Furthermore, these business continuity efforts do not support our data centers outside of Texas or any centers operated by third-party providers.\nProblems at one or more of our data centers, whether or not within our control, could result in service disruptions or delays or loss or corruption of data or documents. This could damage our reputation, cause us to issue credits to customers, subject us to potential liability or costs related to defending against claims, cause customers to terminate or elect not to renew their agreements, any of which could negatively impact our revenues and harm our operating results.\nInterruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center providers could impair our ability to deliver certain of our products to our customers, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, limited growth and reduction in revenue.\nSome of our products and services derived from recent acquisitions are hosted and supported from data centers in other geographic locations within the continental United States and Europe, many of which are operated by third-party providers. Unless and until these acquired products and services are migrated to our Texas-based data centers, we will not have sole control over the operations of all data center facilities used in our business. Our operations depend, in part, on our third-party data center providers\u2019 abilities to protect these facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts and similar events. In the event that any of our third-party hosting or facilities arrangements is terminated, or if there is a lapse of service or damage to a facility, we could experience interruptions in the availability of our on-demand software as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services.\nDespite precautions taken at our controlled and third-party data centers, the occurrence of spikes in usage volume, a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, adverse changes in United States or foreign laws and regulations, vandalism or sabotage, a decision to close a third-party facility without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at a facility could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our on-demand software. Even with current and planned disaster recovery arrangements, our business could be harmed. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause us to issue credits or cause customers to fail to renew their subscriptions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe provide service level commitments to our customers, and our failure to meet the stated service levels could significantly harm our revenue and our reputation.\nOur customer agreements provide that we maintain certain service level commitments to our customers relating primarily to product functionality, network uptime, critical infrastructure availability and hardware replacement. For example, our service level agreements generally require that our solutions are available 98% of the time during coverage hours (normally 6:00 a.m. though 10:00 p.m. Central time daily) 365 days per year (other than certain permitted exceptions such as maintenance). If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments, we may be contractually obligated to provide customers with refunds or credits. Additionally, if we fail to meet our service level commitments a specified number of times within a given time frame or for a specified duration, our customers may terminate their agreements with us or extend the term of their agreements at no additional fee. As a result, a failure to deliver services for a relatively short duration could cause us to issue credits or refunds to a large number of affected customers or result in the loss of customers. In addition, we cannot assure you that our customers will accept these credits, refunds, termination or extension rights in lieu of other legal remedies that may be available to them. Our failure to meet our commitments could also result in substantial customer dissatisfaction or loss. Because of the loss of future revenues through the issuance of credits or the loss of customers or other potential liabilities, our revenue could be significantly impacted if we cannot meet our service level commitments to our customers.\nWe face intense competitive pressures and our failure to compete successfully could harm our operating results.\nThe market for many of our solutions is intensely competitive, fragmented and rapidly changing. Some of these markets have relatively low barriers to entry. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. Increased competition generally could result in pricing pressures, reduced sales and reduced margins. Often we compete to sell our solutions against existing systems that our potential customers have already made significant expenditures to install.\nOur competitors vary depending on our product and service. In the market for accounting software we compete with Yardi Systems, Inc. (\"Yardi\"), MRI Software LLC, Property Solutions International, Inc. (\u201cProperty Solutions\u201d), AMSI Property Management (owned by Infor Global Solutions, Inc.), Intacct Corp, NetSuite Inc., Intuit Inc., Oracle Corporation, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards (each owned by Oracle Corporation), SAP AG, Microsoft Corporation, AppFolio Inc. and various smaller providers of accounting software. High costs are typically associated with switching an organization\u2019s accounting software. In the market for property management software, we face competitive pressure from Yardi and its Voyager products, AMSI Property Management (owned by Infor Global Solutions, Inc.), Boston Post (acquired by MRI Software LLC), Jenark (owned by CoreLogic), Entrata (a division of Property Solutions), ResMan and MRI Software LLC. In the single family market, our accounting and property management systems primarily compete with Yardi, AppFolio Inc., Intuit Inc., DIY Real Estate Solutions (acquired by Yardi), Buildium, LLC, Rent Manager (owned by London Computer Systems, Inc.), and Property Boss Solutions, LLC.\nIn the market for vertically-integrated cloud computing for multifamily real estate owners and property managers, our only substantial competition is from Yardi. We also compete with cloud computing service providers such as Amazon.com Inc., Rackspace Hosting Inc., International Business Machines Corp. and many others.\nWe offer a number of software-enabled value-added services that compete with a disparate and large group of competitors. In the applicant screening market, our principal competitors are LexisNexis (a subsidiary of Reed Elsevier Group plc), CoreLogic, Inc. (formerly First Advantage Corporation, an affiliate of The First American Corporation), Property Solutions, TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions, Inc. (a subsidiary of TransUnion LLC), Resident Check, Inc., Yardi, On-Site.com and many other smaller regional and local screening companies.\nIn the insurance market, our principal competitors are Assurant, Inc., Bader Company, CoreLogic, Inc., Property Solutions, Yardi and a number of national insurance underwriters (including GEICO Corporation, The Allstate Corporation, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, Farmers Insurance Exchange, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and United Services Automobile Association) that market renter's insurance. There are many smaller screening and insurance providers in the risk mitigation area that we encounter less frequently, but they nevertheless present a competitive presence in the market.\nIn the customer relationship management (\u201cCRM\u201d) market, we compete with providers of contact center and call tracking services, including LeaseHawk LLC, Yardi, Property Solutions International, Inc., and numerous regional and local contact centers. In addition, we compete with lead tracking solution providers, including LeaseHawk LLC, Lead Tracking Solutions (acquired by Yardi) and Who\u2019s Calling, Inc. In addition, we compete with content syndication providers VaultWare (owned by MRI Software LLC) and rentbits.com, Inc. Finally, we compete with companies providing web portal services, including Apartments24-7.com, Inc., Ellipse Communications, Inc., Property Solutions, G5 Search Marketing, Inc., Spherexx.com and Yardi. Certain Internet listing services also offer websites for their customers, usually as a free value add to their listing service.\nIn the marketing and web portal services market, we compete with G5 Search Marketing, Inc., Spherexx LLC, ReachLocal, Inc., Property Solutions, On-Site.com, Yodle, Inc., Yardi and many local or regional advertising agencies.\nIn the Internet listing service market, we compete with ForRent (a division of Dominium Enterprises), Apartment Guide (a division of RentPath, Inc.), Rent.com (owned by RentPath, Inc.), RentPath, Inc., Apartments.com (a division of CoStar Group, Inc.), Apartment Finder (a division of Network Communications, Inc.), Move, Inc., Property Solutions, Rent Caf\u00e9 (a division of Yardi), Zillow (and Trulia, Inc.) and many other companies in regional areas.\nIn the Senior Living market, we compete against A Place for Mom, Inc., Care.com, Inc., Caring, Inc., Eldermark, Care Patrol Franchise Systems, LLC, Yardi, Aging with Grace, LLC, SeniorHousingNet.com (owned by Move, Inc.), G5 Search Marketing Inc., SeniorHomes.com (owned by Moseo, Corp.), The Right Click LLC, ALMSA Corporation and many other regionally focused companies.\nIn the utility billing and energy management market, we compete at a national level with American Utility Management, Inc., Conservice, LLC, Yardi (following its acquisitions of ista North America and Energy Billing Systems, Inc.), Property Solutions, Ocius LLC, NWP Services Corporation and Minol USA, L.P. Many other smaller utility billing companies compete for smaller rental properties or in regional areas.\nIn the revenue management market, we compete with Property Solutions, The Rainmaker Group, Inc. and Yardi.\nIn the market for multifamily housing market research, we compete with Reis, Inc., Axiometrics, Inc., Pierce-Eislen, Inc. (owned by Yardi), CoStar Group, Inc. and Portfolio Research, Inc.\nIn the spend management market, we compete with Yardi, AvidXchange, Inc., Nexus Systems, Inc., Ariba, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Buyers Access LLC, PAS Purchasing Solutions and ESS Technologies LLC.\nIn the payment processing market, we compete with Chase Paymentech Solutions, LLC (a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co.), First Data Corporation, Fiserv, Inc., MoneyGram International, Inc., NWP Services Corporation, On-Site.com, Property Solutions, PayLease LLC, RentPayment.com (a subsidiary of Yapstone, Inc.), Yardi, a number of national banking institutions and those that take payments directly from tenants.\nIn the affordable housing compliance and audit services market, we compete with Zeffert and Associates, Inc., Preferred Compliance Solutions, Inc., Spectrum Enterprises, Inc. and many other smaller local and regional compliance and audit services.\nIn the vacation rental market, we compete with LiveRez, Inc., HomeAway Software, Inc., and many other smaller local and regional companies.\nIn addition, many of our existing or potential customers have developed or may develop their own solutions that may be competitive with our solutions. We also may face competition for potential acquisition targets from our competitors who are seeking to expand their offerings.\nWith respect to all of our competitors, we compete based on a number of factors, including: total cost of ownership, level of integration with property management systems, ease of implementation, product functionality and scope, performance, security, scalability and reliability of service, brand and reputation, sales and marketing capabilities and financial resources. Some of our existing competitors and new market entrants may enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger installed customer bases and larger sales and marketing budgets, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, any number of our existing competitors or new market entrants could combine or consolidate to become a more formidable competitor with greater resources. As a result of such competitive advantages, our existing and future competitors may be able to:\n\u2022\ndevelop superior products or services, gain greater market acceptance and expand their offerings more efficiently or more rapidly;\n\u2022\nadapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly;\n\u2022\ntake advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily;\n\u2022\nadopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the promotion of their brand and marketing and sales of their products and services; and\n\u2022\ndevote greater resources to the research and development of their products and services.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our operating results will be harmed.\nWe integrate our software-enabled value-added services with competitive property management software for some of our customers. Our application infrastructure, marketed to our customers as the RealPage Cloud, is based on an open architecture that enables third-party applications to access and interface with applications hosted in the RealPage Cloud through our RealPage Exchange platform. Likewise, through this platform our RealPage Cloud services are able to access and interface with other third-party applications, including third-party property management systems. We also provide services to assist in the implementation, training, support and hosting with respect to the integration of some of our competitors\u2019 applications with our solutions. We sometimes rely on the cooperation of our competitors to implement solutions for our customers. However,\nfrequently our reliance on the cooperation of our competitors can result in delays in integration. There is no assurance that our competitors, even if contractually obligated to do so, will continue to cooperate with us or will not prospectively alter their obligations to do so. We also occasionally develop interfaces between our software-enabled value-added services and competitor property management software without their cooperation or consent. There is no assurance that our competitors will not alter their applications in ways that inhibit or prevent integration or assert that their intellectual property rights restrict our ability to integrate our solutions with their applications. Moreover, regardless of merit, such interface-related activity may result in costly litigation.\nWe face competition to attract consumers to our LeaseStar product websites and mobile applications, which could impair our ability to continue to grow the number of users who use our websites and mobile applications, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of our LeaseStar product family depends in part on our ability to continue to attract additional consumers to our websites and mobile applications. Our existing and potential competitors include companies that could devote greater technical and other resources than we have available, have a more accelerated time frame for deployment and leverage their existing user bases and proprietary technologies to provide products and services that consumers might view as superior to our offerings. Any of our future or existing competitors may introduce different solutions that attract consumers or provide solutions similar to our own but with better branding or marketing resources. If we are unable to continue to grow the number of consumers who use our website and mobile applications, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.\nWe operate in a business environment in which social media integration is playing a significantly increasing role. Social media is a new and rapidly changing industry wherein the rules and regulations related to use and disclosure of personal information is unclear and evolving.\nThe operation and marketing of multi-tenant real estate developments is likely to become more dependent upon the use of and integration with social media platforms as communities attempt to reach their current and target customers through social applications such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Tumblr, Google+ and other current and emerging social applications. The use of these applications necessarily involves the disclosure of personal information by individuals participating in social media, and the corresponding utilization of such personal information by our products and services via integration programs and data exchanges. The regulatory framework for social media privacy and security issues is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies on social media platforms have recently come under increased public scrutiny as various government agencies and consumer groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. We are also subject to each social media platform\u2019s terms and conditions for use, application development and integration, which may be modified, restricted or otherwise changed, affecting and possibly curtailing our ability to offer products and services.\nThese factors, many of which are beyond our control, present a high degree of uncertainty for the future of social media integration. As such, there is no assurance that our participation in social media integration will be risk free, as contractual, statutory or other legal restrictions may be created that limit or otherwise impede our participation in or leverage of social media integration.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors in attracting advertisers, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn our LeaseStar product family, we compete to attract advertisers with media sites, including websites dedicated to providing real estate listings and other rental housing related services to real estate professionals and consumers, major Internet portals, general search engines and social media sites as well as other online companies. We also compete for a share of advertisers\u2019 overall marketing budgets with traditional media such as television, magazines, newspapers and home/apartment guide publications, particularly with respect to advertising dollars spent at the local level by real estate professionals to advertise their qualifications and listings. Large companies with significant brand recognition have large numbers of direct sales personnel and substantial proprietary advertising inventory and web traffic, which may provide a competitive advantage. To compete successfully for advertisers against future and existing competitors, we must continue to invest resources in developing our advertising platform and proving the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products and services. Pressure from competitors seeking to acquire a greater share of our advertisers\u2019 overall marketing budget could adversely affect our pricing and margins, lower our revenue and increase our research and development and marketing expenses. If we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors, our business, financial condition or results of operations would be harmed.\nVariability in our sales and activation cycles could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nThe sales and activation cycles for our solutions, from initial contact with a prospective customer to contract execution and activation, vary widely by customer and solution. We do not recognize revenue until the solution is activated. While most\nof our activations follow a set of standard procedures, a customer\u2019s priorities may delay activation and our ability to recognize revenue, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Additionally, certain of our products are offered in suites containing multiple solutions, resulting in additional fluctuation in activations depending on each customer\u2019s priorities with respect to solutions included in the suite.\nMany of our customers are price sensitive, and if market dynamics require us to change our pricing model or reduce prices, our operating results will be harmed.\nMany of our existing and potential customers are price sensitive, and recent adverse global economic conditions, as well as decreased leasing velocity, have contributed to increased price sensitivity in the multifamily housing market and the other markets that we serve. As market dynamics change, or as new and existing competitors introduce more competitive pricing or pricing models, we may be unable to renew our agreements with existing customers or customers of the businesses we acquire or attract new customers at the same price or based on the same pricing model as previously used. As a result, it is possible that we may be required to change our pricing model, offer price incentives or reduce our prices, which could harm our revenue, profitability and operating results.\nIf we do not effectively expand and train our sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers and our business will be harmed.\nWe continue to be substantially dependent on our sales force to obtain new customers and to sell additional solutions to our existing customers. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business will be harmed.\nMaterial defects or errors in the software we use to deliver our solutions could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our solutions.\nThe software applications underlying our solutions are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have, from time to time, found defects in the software applications underlying our solutions, and new errors in our existing solutions may be detected in the future. Any errors or defects that cause performance problems or service interruptions could result in:\n\u2022\na reduction in new sales or subscription renewal rates;\n\u2022\nunexpected sales credits or refunds to our customers, loss of customers and other potential liabilities;\n\u2022\ndelays in customer payments, increasing our collection reserve and collection cycle;\n\u2022\ndiversion of development resources and associated costs;\n\u2022\nharm to our reputation and brand; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated litigation costs.\nAdditionally, the costs incurred in correcting defects or errors could be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.\nFailure to effectively manage the development, sale and support of our solutions and data processing efforts outside the United States could harm our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to process high volumes of customer data and enhance existing solutions and develop new solutions rapidly and cost effectively. We currently maintain offices in Hyderabad, India and Manila, Philippines where we employ development and data processing personnel. We believe that performing these activities in Hyderabad and Manila increases the efficiency and decreases the costs of our development and data processing efforts. We also maintain an office in Barcelona, Spain where certain of our vacation rental product development, sales and support operations are based. We believe our access to a multilingual European employee base enhances our ability to serve vacation rental property managers in non-English speaking countries. However, managing and staffing international operations requires management\u2019s attention and financial resources. The level of cost savings achieved by our international operations may not exceed the amount of investment and additional resources required to manage and operate these international operations. Additionally, if we experience difficulties as a result of political, social, economic or environmental instability, change in applicable law, limitations of local infrastructure or problems with our workforce or facilities at our or third parties\u2019 international operations, our business could be harmed due to delays in product release schedules or data processing services.\nWe rely on third-party technologies and services that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors, failures or disruptions of our service, any of which could harm our business.\nWe rely on a number of third-party providers in connection with the delivery of our solutions. Such providers include, but are not limited to, computer hardware and software vendors, database and data providers, and cloud hosting providers. We currently utilize equipment, software and services from Akami, Inc.; Avaya, Inc.; Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.; Cisco Systems, Inc.; Dell Inc.; EMC Corporation; Microsoft Corporation; Oracle Corporation; salesforce.com, Inc.; Amazon Web Services, a division of Amazon.com, Inc., as well as many other smaller providers. Our OneSite Accounting service relies on a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, accounting system developed and maintained by a third-party service provider. We host this application in our data centers and provide supplemental development resources to extend this accounting system to meet the unique requirements of the rental housing industry. Our shared cloud portfolio reporting service utilizes software licensed from IBM. We expect to utilize additional service providers as we expand our platform. Although the third-party technologies and services that we currently require are commercially available, such technologies and services may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these technologies or services could result in delays in the provisioning of our solutions until alternative technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, and such delays could harm our business. It also may be time consuming and costly to enter into new relationships. Additionally, any errors or defects in the third-party technologies we utilize or delays or interruptions in the third-party services we rely on could result in errors, failures or disruptions of our services, which also could harm our business.\nWe depend upon third-party service providers for important payment processing functions. If these third-party service providers do not fulfill their contractual obligations or choose to discontinue their services, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results would be harmed.\nWe rely on several large payment processing organizations to enable us to provide payment processing services to our customers, including electronic funds transfers, or EFT, check services, bank card authorization, data capture, settlement and merchant accounting services and access to various reporting tools. These organizations include Bank of America Merchant Services, Bank of America, N.A., Paymentech, LLC, Fiserv, Inc., Financial Transmission Network, Inc., Jack Henry & Associates, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo, N.A. We also rely on third-party hardware manufacturers to manufacture the check scanning hardware our customers utilize to process transactions. Some of these organizations and service providers are competitors who also directly or indirectly sell payment processing services to customers in competition with us. With respect to these organizations and service providers, we have significantly less control over the systems and processes than if we were to maintain and operate them ourselves. In some cases, functions necessary to our business are performed on proprietary third-party systems and software to which we have no access. We also generally do not have long-term contracts with these organizations and service providers. Accordingly, the failure of these organizations and service providers to renew their contracts with us or fulfill their contractual obligations and perform satisfactorily could result in significant disruptions to our operations and adversely affect operating results. In addition, businesses that we have acquired, or may acquire in the future, typically rely on other payment processing service providers. We may encounter difficulty converting payment processing services from these service providers to our payment processing platform. If we are required to find an alternative source for performing these functions, we may have to expend significant money, time and other resources to develop or obtain an alternative, and if developing or obtaining an alternative is not accomplished in a timely manner and without significant disruption to our business, we may be unable to fulfill our responsibilities to customers or meet their expectations, with the attendant potential for liability claims, damage to our reputation, loss of ability to attract or maintain customers and reduction of our revenue or profits.\nWe face a number of risks in our payment processing business that could result in a reduction in our revenues and profits.\nIn connection with our electronic payment processing services, we process renter payments and subsequently submit these renter payments to our customers after varying clearing times established by RealPage. These payments are settled through our sponsoring clearing banks, and in the case of EFT, our Originating Depository Financial Institutions, or ODFIs. Currently, we rely on Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as our sponsoring clearing banks. In the future, we expect to enter into similar sponsoring clearing bank relationships with one or more other national banking institutions. The renter payments that we process for our customers at our sponsoring clearing banks are identified in our consolidated balance sheets as restricted cash and the corresponding liability for these renter payments is identified as customer deposits. Our electronic payment processing business and related maintenance of custodial accounts subjects us to a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nliability for customer costs related to disputed or fraudulent transactions if those costs exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have during the clearing period or after renter payments have been settled to our customers;\n\u2022\nelectronic processing limits on the amount of custodial balances that any single ODFI, or collectively all of our ODFIs, will underwrite;\n\u2022\nreliance on clearing bank sponsors, card payment processors and other service payment provider partners to process electronic transactions;\n\u2022\nfailure by us or our bank sponsors to adhere to applicable laws and regulatory requirements or the standards of the electronic payments rules and regulations and other rules and regulations that may impact the provision of electronic payment services;\n\u2022\ncontinually evolving and developing laws and regulations governing payment processing and money transmission, the application or interpretation of which is not clear in some jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nincidences of fraud, a security breach or our failure to comply with required external audit standards; and\n\u2022\nour inability to increase our fees at times when electronic payment partners or associations increase their transaction processing fees.\nIf any of these risks related to our electronic payment processing business were to materialize, our business or financial results could be negatively affected. Although we attempt to structure and adapt our payment processing operations to comply with these complex and evolving laws and regulations, our efforts may not guarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to be in violation of these legal requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines, cease and desist orders, mandatory product changes, or other penalties that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, with respect to the processing of EFTs, we are exposed to financial risk. EFTs between a renter and our customer may be returned for various reasons such as insufficient funds or stop payment orders. These returns are charged back to the customer by us. However, if we or our sponsoring clearing banks are unable to collect such amounts from the customer\u2019s account or if the customer refuses or is unable to reimburse us for the chargeback, we bear the risk of loss for the amount of the transfer. While we have not experienced material losses resulting from chargebacks in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future. Any increase in chargebacks not paid by our customers may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe entered into a Service Provider Agreement with Wells Fargo Merchant Services, LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, NA (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), effective January 1, 2014. Under the Service Provider Agreement, RealPage, Inc. is a registered independent sales organization, or ISO, of Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo will act as a merchant acquiring bank for processing RealPage client credit card and debit card payments (\u201cCard Payments\u201d), and RealPage will serve as an ISO. As an ISO, RealPage will assume the underwriting risk for processing Card Payments on behalf of its clients. If RealPage experiences excessive chargebacks, either RealPage or Wells Fargo has the authority to cease client card processing services, and such events could result in a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income, and reputation.\nEvolution and expansion of our payment processing business may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks, for which failure to comply or adapt could harm our operating results.\nThe evolution and expansion of our payment processing business may subject us to additional risks and regulatory requirements, including laws covering money transmission and anti-money laundering. These requirements vary throughout the markets in which we operate, and several jurisdictions lack clarity in the application and interpretation of these rules. In order to maintain flexibility in the growth and expansion of our payments operations, we have obtained money transmitter licenses (or its equivalent) in several states and expect to continue the license application process in additional jurisdictions throughout the United States as needed to accommodate new product development. Our efforts to acquire and maintain this licensure could result in significant management time, effort, and cost, and may still not guarantee compliance given the constant state of change in these regulatory frameworks. While we maintain a compliance program focused on applicable laws and regulations throughout the payments industry, there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to fines, criminal and civil lawsuits or other regulatory enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, or be required to adjust business practices to accommodate future regulatory requirements.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our software platform and infrastructure, or our customers\u2019 or their renters\u2019 or prospects\u2019 data, we may incur significant liabilities, third parties may misappropriate our intellectual property, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure and customers may curtail or stop using our solutions.\nMaintaining the security of our software platform and service infrastructure is of paramount importance to us and our customers, and we devote significant resources to this effort. Breaches of the security measures we take to protect our software platform and service infrastructure and our and our customers\u2019 confidential or proprietary information that is stored on and transmitted through those systems could disrupt and compromise the security of our internal systems and on demand applications, impair our ability to provide products and services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, compromise our confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nThe solutions we provide involve the collection, storage and transmission of confidential personal and proprietary information regarding our customers and our customers\u2019 current and prospective renters and business partners. Specifically, we collect, store and transmit a variety of customer data such as demographic information and payment histories of our customers\u2019 prospective and current renters and business partners. Additionally, we collect and transmit sensitive financial data such as credit card and bank account information. Treatment of certain types of data, such as personally identifiable information, protected health information and sensitive financial data may be subject to federal or state regulations requiring heightened privacy and security. If our data security or data integrity measures are breached or otherwise fail or prove to be inadequate for any reason, as a result of third-party actions or our employees\u2019 or contractors\u2019 errors or malfeasance or otherwise, and unauthorized persons obtain access to this information, or the data is otherwise compromised, we could incur significant liability to our customers and to their prospective or current renters or business partners, significant costs associated with internal regulatory investigations and litigation, or significant fines and sanctions by payment processing networks or governmental authorities. Any of these events or circumstances could result in damage to our reputation and material harm to our business.\nWe also rely upon our customers as users of our system to promote security of the system and the data within it, such as administration of customer-side access credentialing and control of customer-side display of data. On occasion, our customers have failed to perform these activities in such a manner as to prevent unauthorized access to data. To date, these breaches have not resulted in claims against us or in material harm to our business, but we cannot be certain that the failure of our customers in future periods to perform these activities will not result in claims against us, which could expose us to potential litigation, damage to our reputation and material harm to our business.\nThere can be no certainty that the measures we have taken to protect our software platform and service infrastructure, our confidential and proprietary information and the privacy and integrity of our customers\u2019, their current or prospective renters\u2019 and business partners\u2019 data are adequate to prevent or remedy unauthorized access to our system. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Experienced computer programmers seeking to intrude or cause harm, or hackers, may attempt to penetrate our service infrastructure from time to time. Hackers may consist of sophisticated organizations, competitors, governments or individuals who launch targeted attacks to gain unauthorized access to our systems. A hacker who is able to penetrate our service infrastructure could misappropriate proprietary or confidential information or cause interruptions in our services. We might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, or to remedy, problems caused by hackers, and we may not have a timely remedy against a hacker who is able to penetrate our service infrastructure. In addition to purposeful breaches, inadvertent actions or the transmission of computer viruses could expose us to security risks. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs or if our customers and potential customers perceive vulnerabilities, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose sales and customers and our business could be materially harmed.\nIf we are unable to cost-effectively scale or adapt our existing architecture to accommodate increased traffic, technological advances or changing customer requirements, our operating results could be harmed.\nAs we continue to increase our customer base and the number of products used by our customers to manage units, the number of users accessing our on demand software solutions over the Internet will continue to increase. Increased traffic could result in slow access speeds and response times. Since our customer agreements typically include service availability commitments, slow speeds or our failure to accommodate increased traffic could result in breaches of our customer agreements. In addition, the market for our solutions is characterized by rapid technological advances and changes in customer requirements. In order to accommodate increased traffic and respond to technological advances and evolving customer requirements, we expect that we will be required to make future investments in our network architecture. If we do not implement future upgrades to our network architecture cost-effectively, or if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in connection with upgrading our network architecture, our service quality may suffer and our operating results could be harmed.\nBecause certain solutions we provide depend on access to customer data, decreased access to this data or the failure to comply with the evolving laws and regulations governing privacy of data, cloud computing and cross-border data transfers, or the failure to address privacy concerns applicable to such data, could harm our business.\nCertain of our solutions depend on our continued access to our customers\u2019 data regarding their prospective and current renters, including data compiled by other third-party service providers who collect and store data on behalf of our customers. Federal, state and foreign governments have adopted and continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information. Such laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our solutions or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services and solutions in certain locations.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our customers may expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business.\nAny restrictions on the use of or decrease in the availability of data from our customers, or other third parties that collect and store such data on behalf of our customers, and the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, applicable legislative and regulatory initiatives may limit our ability to collect, aggregate or use this data. Any limitations on our ability to collect, aggregate or use such data could reduce demand for certain of our solutions. Additionally, any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy laws, regulations and policies, could result in liability to us or damage to our reputation and could inhibit sales and market acceptance of our solutions and harm our business.\nThe market for on demand software solutions in the rental housing industry continues to develop, and if it does not develop further or develops more slowly than we expect, our business will be harmed.\nThe market for on demand SaaS software solutions in the rental housing industry delivered via the Internet through a web browser is rapidly growing but still relatively immature compared to the market for traditional on premise software installed on a customer\u2019s local personal computer or server. It is uncertain whether the on demand delivery model will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance, making our business and future prospects difficult to evaluate and predict. While our existing customer base has widely accepted this new model, our future success will depend, to a large extent, on the willingness of our potential customers to choose on demand software solutions for business processes that they view as critical. Many of our potential customers have invested substantial effort and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses and may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to on demand software solutions. Some businesses may be reluctant or unwilling to use on demand software solutions because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, reliability and availability, among other things, of the on demand delivery model. If potential customers do not consider on demand software solutions to be beneficial, then the market for these solutions may not further develop, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would adversely affect our operating results.\nIf use of the Internet and mobile technology, particularly with respect to online rental housing products and services, does not continue to increase as rapidly as we anticipate, our business could be harmed.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued use of the Internet and mobile technology as effective media of business and communication by our customers and consumers. Internet and mobile technology use may not continue to develop at historical rates, and consumers may not continue to use the Internet or mobile technology as media for information exchange or we may not keep up with the latest technology. Further, these media may not be accepted as viable long-term outlets for rental housing information for a number of reasons, including actual or perceived lack of security of information and possible disruptions of service or connectivity. If consumers begin to access rental housing information through other media and we fail to innovate, our business may be negatively impacted.\nEconomic trends that affect the rental housing market may have a negative effect on our business.\nOur customers include a range of organizations whose success is intrinsically linked to the rental housing market. Economic trends that negatively or positively affect the rental housing market may adversely affect our business. The downturn in the global economy which began in 2008 has caused volatility in the real estate markets, generally, including the rental housing market, and increases in the rates of mortgage defaults and bankruptcy. Although these trends have reversed, a repeat of these factors would negatively impact our business. Instability or downturns affecting the rental housing market may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations by:\n\u2022\ndecreasing demand for leasing and marketing solutions;\n\u2022\nreducing the number of occupied sites and units on which we earn revenue;\n\u2022\npreventing our customers from expanding their businesses and managing new properties;\n\u2022\ncausing our customers to reduce spending on our solutions;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to increased pricing pressure in order to add new customers and retain existing customers;\n\u2022\ncausing our customers to switch to lower-priced solutions provided by our competitors or internally developed solutions;\n\u2022\ndelaying or preventing our collection of outstanding accounts receivable; and\n\u2022\ncausing payment processing losses related to an increase in customer insolvency.\nIn addition, economic trends that reduce the frequency of renter turnover or the quantity of new renters may reduce the number of rental transactions completed by our customers and may, as a result, reduce demand for our rental, leasing or marketing transaction specific services.\nIf customers and other advertisers reduce or end their advertising spending on our LeaseStar products and we are unable to attract new advertisers, our business would be harmed.\nSome components of our LeaseStar product family depend on advertising generated through sales to real estate agents and brokerages, property owners and other advertisers relevant to rental housing. Our ability to attract and retain advertisers, and ultimately to generate advertising revenue, depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing the number of consumers of our LeaseStar products and services;\n\u2022\ncompeting effectively for advertising dollars with other online media companies;\n\u2022\ncontinuing to develop our advertising products and services;\n\u2022\nkeeping pace with changes in technology and with our competitors; and\n\u2022\noffering an attractive return on investment to our advertiser customers for their advertising spending with us.\nReductions in lead generation could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nWe could face reductions in leads generated for our clients if third-party originators of such leads were to elect to suspend sending leads to us or our sources for such leads were reduced. Reductions in leads generated could reduce the value of our lead generation services, make it difficult for us to add new lead generation services customers, retain existing lead generation services customers and maintain or increase sales levels to our existing lead generation services customers and could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, including the need to develop new solutions or enhance our existing solutions, enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges or opportunities could be significantly limited.\nOur debt obligations contain restrictions that impact our business and expose us to risks that could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nOn September 30, 2014, we entered into a new agreement for a secured revolving credit facility to refinance our outstanding revolving loans. The new credit facility provides an aggregate principal amount of up to $200.0 million, with sublimits of $10.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit and for $20.0 million of swingline loans. The credit facility also allows us, under certain conditions, to request additional term loans or revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150.0 million, plus an amount that would not cause our consolidated net leverage ratio to exceed 3.25 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2014, we had $20.0 million of debt outstanding under our revolving line of credit and $10.0 million was available for the issuance of letters of credit. Advances under the credit facility may be voluntarily prepaid and re-borrowed. All outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest is due upon the credit facility's maturity, September 30, 2019.\nAll of our obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets. All of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries are required to guaranty our obligations under the credit facility, other than certain immaterial subsidiaries, foreign subsidiary holding companies and our payment processing subsidiaries. Such guarantees by existing and future domestic subsidiaries are and will be secured by substantially all of the assets of such subsidiaries.\nOur credit facility contains customary covenants, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications, which limit our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness of others;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022\ndispose of assets;\n\u2022\nprepay certain indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake changes to our governing documents and certain of our agreements;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other distributions on our capital stock, and redeem and repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments, including acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nOur credit facility also contains, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications, customary affirmative covenants. We are also required to comply with a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. The interest coverage ratio, which is a ratio of our four previous consecutive fiscal quarters' consolidated EBITDA to our interest expense, is to be not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. The consolidated net leverage ratio, which is the ratio of funded indebtedness on the last day of each fiscal quarter to the four previous consecutive fiscal quarters' consolidated EBITDA, cannot exceed 3.50 to 1.00, provided that we can elect to increase the ratio to 3.75 to 1.00 for a specified period following a permitted acquisition. As of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit facility.\nThe credit facility contains customary events of default, subject to customary cure periods for certain defaults, that include, among others, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, material judgment defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, cross-defaults to certain other material indebtedness, ERISA defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties and a change in control default.\nIf we experience a decline in cash flow due to any of the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section or otherwise, we could have difficulty paying interest and principal amounts due on our indebtedness and meeting the financial covenants set forth in our credit facility. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments under our credit facility, or if we fail to comply with the requirements of our indebtedness, we could default under our credit facility. Any default that is not cured or waived could result in the termination of the revolving commitments, the acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility, an increase in the applicable interest rate under the credit facility and a requirement that our subsidiaries that have guaranteed the credit facility pay the obligations in full, and would permit our lender to exercise remedies with respect to all of the collateral that is securing the credit facility, including substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors\u2019 assets. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nEven if we comply with all of the applicable covenants, the restrictions on the conduct of our business could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be beneficial to the business. Even if the credit facility was terminated, additional debt we could incur in the future may subject us to similar or additional covenants.\nAssertions by a third party that we infringe its intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses.\nThe software and technology industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, misuse and other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed or otherwise misappropriated the intellectual property rights or terms of use of others. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims against their use. Since we currently have no patents, we may not use patent infringement as a defensive strategy in such litigation. Additionally, although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents, we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. If such patents are invalidated or circumvented, this may allow existing and potential competitors to develop products and services that are competitive with, or superior to, our solutions.\nMany of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for certain third-party claims, such as intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase our costs of defending such claims and may require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling or settlement related to any such claims. These types of claims could harm our relationships with our customers, may deter future customers from purchasing our solutions or could expose us to litigation for these claims. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our intellectual property in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party.\nLitigation could force us to stop selling, incorporating or using our solutions that include the challenged intellectual property or redesign those solutions that use the technology. In addition, we may have to pay damages if we are found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We may have to procure a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities in one or more respects. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could\nrequire significant effort and expense. There is no assurance that we would be able to develop alternative solutions or, if alternative solutions were developed, that they would perform as required or be accepted in the relevant markets. In some instances, if we are unable to offer non-infringing technology, or obtain a license for such technology, we may be required to refund some or the entire license fee paid for the infringing technology by our customers.\nOur exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to acquired technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Such risks include, without limitation, patent infringement risks, copyright infringement risks or the inclusion of open source software subject to onerous license provisions or violations of terms of use that could even require the disclosure of our proprietary source code. Third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.\nAny failure to protect and successfully enforce our intellectual property rights could compromise our proprietary technology and impair our brands.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies we use in our solutions. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights adequately, our competitors could use the intellectual property we have developed to enhance their own products and services, which could harm our business. We rely on a combination of copyright, service mark, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We currently have no issued patents or pending patent applications and may be unable to obtain patent protection in the future. In addition, if any patents are issued in the future, they may not provide us with any competitive advantages, may not be issued in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek and may be successfully challenged by third parties. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use the technologies underlying our solutions. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technologies is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who have not incurred the substantial expense, time and effort required to create similar innovative products.\nWe cannot assure you that any future service mark or trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any registered service marks or trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights. If we are unable to secure new marks, maintain already existing marks and enforce the rights to use such marks against unauthorized third-party use, our ability to brand, identify and promote our solutions in the marketplace could be impaired, which could harm our business.\nWe customarily enter into agreements with our employees, contractors and certain parties with whom we do business to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. The legal and technical steps we have taken, however, may not prevent unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, we may be required to release the source code of our software to third parties under certain circumstances. For example, some of our customer agreements provide that if we cease to maintain or support a certain solution without replacing it with a successor solution, then we may be required to release the source code of the software underlying such solution. In addition, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. Moreover, it may be difficult or practically impossible to detect copyright infringement or theft of our software code. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions being successful against these infringers, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. Furthermore, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.\nAdditionally, as we sell our solutions internationally, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available or as robust in every country in which our solutions are available. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent competitors outside the United States from infringing or otherwise misappropriating our intellectual property rights, which could reduce our competitive advantage and ability to compete or otherwise harm our business.\nWe may be unable to halt the operations of websites that aggregate or misappropriate data from our LeaseStar websites.\nFrom time to time, third parties have misappropriated data from our LeaseStar websites through website scraping, software robots or other means and aggregated this data on their websites with data from other companies. In addition, copycat websites have misappropriated data on our network and attempted to imitate our brand or the functionality of our website. When we have become aware of such websites, we have employed technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt their operations. However, we may be unable to detect all such websites in a timely manner and, even if we could, technological and legal measures may be insufficient to halt their operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the United States, our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the impact of the operation of such websites. Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources, which could harm our business, results of\noperations or financial condition. In addition, to the extent that such activity creates confusion among consumers or advertisers, our brand and business could be harmed.\nLegal proceedings against us could be costly and time consuming to defend.\nWe are from time to time subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including claims brought by our customers or vendors in connection with commercial disputes, claims brought by our customers\u2019 current or prospective renters, including class action lawsuits based on asserted statutory or regulatory violations, employment-based claims made by our current or former employees, administrative agencies, government regulators, or insurers. In November 2014, the Company was named in a purported class action lawsuit in the Eastern District of Virginia, Jenkins v. RealPage, Inc., Case No. 3:14cv758. On January 12, 2015, the Company filed its answer. This case is at an early stage and although we intend to defend it vigorously, it is not possible to predict its outcome. Litigation, enforcement actions and other legal proceedings, regardless of their outcome, may result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and our resources, which may harm our business, overall financial condition and operating results. In addition, legal claims that have not yet been asserted against us may be asserted in the future. Although we maintain insurance, there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or sufficient to cover any such legal proceedings or claims. For example, insurance may not cover such legal proceedings or claims or may withhold or dispute coverage of such legal proceedings or claims on various grounds, including by alleging such coverage is beyond the scope of such policies, that we are not in compliance with the terms of such insurance policies or that such policies are not in effect, even after proceeds under such insurance policies have been received by us. In addition, insurance may not be sufficient for one or more such legal proceedings or claims and may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. A legal proceeding or claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby harming our operating results.\nWe could be sued for contract, warranty or product liability claims, and such lawsuits may disrupt our business, divert management\u2019s attention and our financial resources or have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe provide warranties to customers of certain of our solutions and services relating primarily to product functionality, network uptime, critical infrastructure availability and hardware replacement. General errors, defects, inaccuracies or other performance problems in the software applications underlying our solutions or inaccuracies in or loss of the data we provide to our customers could result in financial or other damages to our customers. Additionally, errors associated with any delivery of our services, including utility billing, could result in financial or other damages to our customers. There can be no assurance that any limitations of liability set forth in our contracts would be enforceable or would otherwise protect us from liability for damages. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions, in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. There can be no assurance that this coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large product liability claims, or that the insurer will not deny coverage for any future claim or dispute coverage of such legal proceedings or claims even after proceeds under such insurance policies have been received by us. The successful assertion of one or more large product liability claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to develop our brands cost-effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nWe market our solutions under discrete brand names. We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future solutions and is an important element in attracting new customers and retaining our existing customers. Additionally, we believe that developing these brands in a cost-effective manner is critical in meeting our expected margins. In the past, our efforts to build our brands have involved significant expenses and we intend to continue to make expenditures on brand promotion. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands. If we fail to cost-effectively build and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract new customers or retain our existing customers, and our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors\u2019 views of us.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. We are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors. If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, harm our ability to operate our business and reduce the trading price of our stock.\nChanges in, or errors in our interpretations and applications of, financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices or errors in our interpretations and applications of financial accounting standards or practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way in which we conduct our business.\nWe have incurred, and will incur, increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company, we have incurred, and will incur, significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the Securities Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. We expect these rules and regulations to continue to affect our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. As a public company, it is more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.\nThe rental housing industry, electronic commerce and many of the products and services that we offer, including background screening services, utility billing, affordable housing compliance and audit services, insurance and payments, are subject to extensive and evolving governmental regulation. Changes in regulations or our failure to comply with regulations could harm our operating results.\nThe rental housing industry is subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations. Our services and solutions must work within the extensive and evolving legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our customers and third-party service providers, including, but not limited to, those under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the United States Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86), which is an IRS law governing tax credits, the Privacy Rules, Safeguards Rule and Consumer Report Information Disposal Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, the FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), the CAN-SPAM Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the regulations of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, HIPAA/HITECH, rules and regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and complex and divergent state and local laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, credit and consumer reporting, deceptive trade practices, discrimination in housing, telemarketing, electronic communications, call recording, utility billing and energy and gas consumption. These regulations are complex, change frequently and may become more stringent over time. Although we attempt to structure and adapt our solutions and service offerings to comply with these complex and evolving laws and regulations, we may be found to be in violation. If we are found to be in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to administrative and other enforcement actions as well as class action lawsuits or demands for client reimbursement. Additionally, many applicable laws and regulations provide for penalties or assessments on a per occurrence basis. Due to the nature of our business, the type of services we provide and the large number of transactions processed by our solutions, our potential liability in an enforcement action or class action lawsuit could be significant. In addition, entities such as HUD, the FTC and the CFPB have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations that may impact our customers and our business. We believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personally identifiable information or consumer information could affect our customers\u2019 ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for our on demand software solutions.\nSome of our LeaseStar products operate under the real estate brokerage laws of numerous states and require maintaining licenses in many of these states. Brokerage laws in these states could change, affecting our ability to provide some LeaseStar, or if applicable, other products in these states.\nWe deliver our on demand software solutions over the Internet and sell and market certain of our solutions over the Internet. As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. Taxation of products or services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of on demand software solutions, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur business is subject to the risks of international operations.\nCompliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure\nrules, data privacy and filtering requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and antitrust and competition regulations, among others.\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to carry on operations in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022\npolitical, social, economic or environmental instability, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general;\n\u2022\nlimitations of local infrastructure;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nhigher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\n\u2022\noutbreaks of highly contagious diseases.\nIf we are unable to manage the complexity of our international operations successfully, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur LeasingDesk insurance business is subject to governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth.\nThrough our wholly owned subsidiary, Multifamily Internet Ventures LLC, we hold insurance agent licenses from a number of individual state departments of insurance and are subject to state governmental regulation and supervision in connection with the operation of our LeasingDesk insurance business. Furthermore, state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations, audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance agents. This state governmental supervision could reduce our profitability or limit the growth of our LeasingDesk insurance business by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance, limiting or restricting the solutions we provide or the methods by which we provide them or subjecting us to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. Our continued ability to maintain these insurance agent licenses in the jurisdictions in which we are licensed depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions.\nIn all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations, as well as regulate rates that may be charged for premiums on policies. Accordingly, we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of the activities of our LeasingDesk insurance business or fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our LeasingDesk insurance business can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past.\nWe generate commission revenue from the insurance policies we sell as a registered insurance agent and if insurance premiums decline or if the insureds experience greater than expected losses, our revenues could decline and our operating results could be harmed.\nThrough our wholly owned subsidiary, Multifamily Internet Ventures LLC, a managing general insurance agency, we generate commission revenue from offering liability and renter\u2019s insurance. Through Multifamily Internet Ventures LLC we also sell additional insurance products, including auto and other personal lines insurance, to renters that buy renter's insurance from us. These policies are ultimately underwritten by various insurance carriers. Some of the property owners and managers that participate in our programs opt to require renters to purchase rental insurance policies and agree to grant to Multifamily Internet Ventures LLC exclusive marketing rights at their properties. If demand for residential rental housing declines, property owners and managers may be forced to reduce their rental rates and to stop requiring the purchase of rental insurance in order to reduce the overall cost of renting. If property owners or managers cease to require renter's insurance, elect to offer policies from competing providers or insurance premiums decline, our revenues from selling insurance policies will be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, one type of commission paid by insurance carriers to Multifamily Internet Ventures LLC is contingent commission, which is affected by claims experienced at the properties for which the renters purchase insurance. In the event that the severity or frequency of claims by the insureds increase unexpectedly, the contingent commission we typically earn\nwill be adversely affected. As a result, our quarterly, or annual, operating results could fall below the expectations of analysts or investors, in which event our stock price may decline.\nMultifamily Internet Ventures LLC is required to maintain a 50-state general agency insurance license as well as individual insurance licenses for each sales agent involved in the solicitation of insurance products. Both the agency and individual licenses require compliance with state insurance regulations, payment of licensure fees and continuing education programs. In the event that regulatory compliance requirements are not met, Multifamily Internet Ventures LLC could be subject to license suspension or revocation, state Department of Insurance audits and regulatory fines. As a result, our ability to engage in the business of insurance could be restricted, and our operating revenue will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. Our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheet, even if we maintain profitability.\nIf we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the solutions we sell in additional taxing jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and our future sales may decrease.\nStates and some local taxing jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. We review these rules and regulations periodically and currently collect and remit sales taxes in taxing jurisdictions where we believe we are required to do so. However, additional state and/or local taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on us, including for past sales. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales or other taxes on our solutions could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our solutions or may otherwise harm our business and operating results. This risk is greater with regard to solutions acquired through acquisitions.\nWe may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in jurisdictions where we already collect and remit sales taxes. A successful assertion that we have not collected and remitted taxes at the appropriate levels may also result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales. Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges. Our customer contracts provide that our customers must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes. Nevertheless, customers may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our customers fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our solutions going forward will effectively increase the cost of such solutions to our customers and may adversely affect our ability to continue to sell those solutions to existing customers or to gain new customers in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.\nChanges in our effective tax rate could harm our future operating results.\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, including jurisdictions in which we have completed or may complete acquisitions, certain non-deductible expenses arising from the requirement to expense stock options and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including our ability to utilize our net operating losses. Increases in our effective tax rate could harm our operating results.\nWe rely on our management team and need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur success and future growth depend on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team. The loss of our Chief Executive Officer or other senior executives could adversely affect our business. Our future success also will depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled software developers, marketing and sales personnel, technical support and product development personnel in the United States and internationally. All of our employees work for us on an at-will basis. Competition for these types of personnel is intense, particularly in the software industry. As a result, we may be unable to attract or retain qualified personnel. Our inability to attract and retain the necessary personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that a strong corporate culture that nurtures core values and philosophies is essential to our long-term success. We call these values and philosophies the \u201cRealPage Promise\u201d and we seek to practice the RealPage Promise in our actions\nevery day. The RealPage Promise embodies our corporate values with respect to customer service, investor communications, employee respect and professional development and management decision-making and leadership. As our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture which could negatively impact our future success.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe concentration of our capital stock owned by insiders may limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur executive officers, directors and entities affiliated with them together beneficially owned approximately 34.0% of our common stock as of December 31, 2014. Further, Stephen T. Winn, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and entities beneficially owned by Mr. Winn held an aggregate of approximately 32.7% of our common stock as of December 31, 2014. This significant concentration of ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Mr. Winn and entities beneficially owned by Mr. Winn may control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders.\nThe trading price of our common stock price may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including, but not limited to, those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, some of which are beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results or in expectations regarding our operating results;\n\u2022\nvariations in operating results of similar companies;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new solutions or enhancements, strategic alliances or agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by competitors regarding their entry into new markets, and new product, service and pricing strategies;\n\u2022\nmarketing, advertising or other initiatives by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nincreases or decreases in our sales of products and services for use in the management of units by customers and increases or decreases in the number of units managed by our customers;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\nmajor changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any research analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nsales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders;\n\u2022\nvolatility in our stock price, which may lead to higher stock-based compensation expense under applicable accounting standards; and\n\u2022\nadoption or modification of regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology and specifically Internet-related companies, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and our resources, whether or not we are successful in such litigation.\nOur stock price could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 79,037,351 shares of common stock outstanding. Of these shares, 76,892,832 were immediately tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless these shares are held by \u201caffiliates,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nAs of December 31, 2014, holders of 25,440,626 shares, or approximately 32.2%, of our outstanding common stock were entitled to rights with respect to the registration of these shares under the Securities Act. If we register their shares of common stock, these stockholders could sell those shares in the public market without being subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144 and Rule 701.\nIn 2012, we registered a total of 4,694,073 shares of our outstanding common stock held by affiliates pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3, which shares are now freely tradable in the public market.\nIn addition, we have registered approximately 22,134,259 shares of common stock that have been issued or reserved for future issuance under our stock incentive plans. Of these shares, 2,455,134 shares were eligible for sale upon the exercise of vested options as of December 31, 2014.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nnot providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nauthorizing our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nThese and other provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nIf securities analysts do not continue to publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nWe expect that the trading price for our common stock may be affected by research or reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay cash dividends, you would receive a return on your investment in our common stock only if the market price of our common stock has increased when you sell your shares. In addition, the terms of our credit facilities currently restrict our ability to pay dividends. See additional discussion under the Dividend Policy heading of Part II, Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "PERMNO": 12089, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "RP"}
