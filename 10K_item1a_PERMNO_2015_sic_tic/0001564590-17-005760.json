{"cik": "1649749", "company": "FB Financial Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks related to our business\nOur business concentration in Tennessee imposes risks resulting from any regional or local economic downturn affecting Tennessee, and if we do not effectively manage our asset quality and credit risk, we would experience loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe conduct our banking operations primarily in Tennessee as a significant majority of the loans in our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016 were secured by properties and collateral located in Tennessee. Likewise, as of such date, approximately 88% of the loans in our loan portfolio were made to borrowers who live and/or primarily conduct business in Tennessee. This geographic concentration imposes risks from lack of geographic diversification, as adverse economic developments in Tennessee (including the Nashville MSA, our largest market), among other things, could affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of nonperforming assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects Tennessee or existing or prospective borrowers or property values in such areas may affect us and our profitability more significantly and more adversely than our competitors whose operations are less geographically concentrated.\nIn addition, making any loan involves risk, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service debt, and risks resulting from changes in economic and market conditions. Our credit risk approval and monitoring procedures may fail to identify or reduce these credit risks, and they cannot completely eliminate all credit risks related to our loan portfolio. If the overall economic climate, including employment rates, real estate markets, interest rates and general economic growth, in the United States, generally, or Tennessee (particularly the Nashville MSA), specifically, experiences material disruption, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, the collateral we hold may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require additional provisions for loan losses, which would cause our net income and return on equity to decrease.\nBecause a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 73% of our loan portfolio was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. This includes collateral consisting of income producing and residential construction properties, which properties tend to be more sensitive to general economic conditions and downturns in real estate markets. As a result, adverse developments affecting real estate values in our market areas could increase the credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of\ntime as a result of market conditions in the area in which the real estate is located. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, and could result in losses that would adversely affect credit quality, financial condition, and results of operation. Negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in our market areas could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Such declines and losses would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to higher credit risk by commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction based lending as well as relationship exposure with a number of large borrowers.\nCommercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction based lending usually involve higher credit risks than 1-4 family residential real estate lending. As of December 31, 2016, the following loan types accounted for the stated percentages of our loan portfolio: commercial real estate (both owner-occupied and non-owner occupied)-34%; commercial and industrial-21%; and construction-13%. These types of loans also involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers. These higher credit risks are further heightened when the loans are concentrated in a small number of larger borrowers leading to relationship exposure. As of December 31, 2016, we had 19 relationships with over $10 million of outstanding borrowings with us. While we are not dependent on any of these relationships and while none of these large relationships have directly impacted our allowance for loan losses, a deterioration of any of these large credits could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or result in significant losses to us.\nNon-owner occupied commercial real estate loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties, in addition to the factors affecting residential real estate borrowers. These loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortizing over the loan period, but have a balloon payment due at maturity. A borrower\u2019s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or sell the underlying property in a timely manner.\nThe banking regulators are giving commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny, and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures.\nCommercial and industrial loans and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are typically based on the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loans from the cash flow of their businesses. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the business itself. In addition, the assets securing the loans have the following characteristics: (i) they depreciate over time, (ii) they are difficult to appraise and liquidate, and (iii) they fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.\nRisk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction or development equals or exceeds the cost of the property construction or development (including interest), the availability of permanent take-out financing and the builder\u2019s ability to ultimately sell the property. During the construction or development phase, a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns. If estimates of value are inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan or by seizure of collateral.\nCommercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and construction loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. Our underwriting, review and monitoring cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these loans.\nWe also make both secured and unsecured loans to our commercial clients. Secured commercial loans are generally collateralized by real estate, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower or may include a personal guaranty of the business owner. Unsecured loans generally involve a higher degree of risk of loss than do secure loans because, without collateral, repayment is wholly dependent upon the success of the borrowers\u2019 businesses. Because of this lack of collateral, we are limited in our ability to collect on defaulted unsecured loans. Furthermore, the collateral that secures our secured commercial and industrial loans typically includes inventory, accounts receivable and equipment, which if the business is unsuccessful, usually has a value that is insufficient to satisfy the loan without a loss.\nIn addition, in recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed \u201clender liability.\u201d Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders. In the future, we could become subject to claims based on this or other evolving legal theories.\nOur success is largely dependent upon our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and if we are unable to successfully execute our business strategy, our business, growth prospects and financial results and operations could be materially and adversely impaired.\nOur success, including our ability to achieve our growth and profitability goals, is dependent on the ability of our management team to execute on our long-term business strategy, which requires them to, among other things:\n\u2022\nattract and retain experienced and talented bankers in each of our markets;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate funding sources, including by continuing to attract stable, low-cost deposits;\n\u2022\nenhance our market penetration in our metropolitan markets and maintain our leadership position in our community markets;\n\u2022\nimprove our operating efficiency;\n\u2022\nimplement new technologies to enhance the client experience, keep pace with our competitors and improve efficiency;\n\u2022\nidentify attractive acquisition targets, consummate such acquisitions on favorable terms and successfully integrate acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nattract and maintain business banking relationships with well-qualified businesses, real estate developers and investors with proven track records in our market areas;\n\u2022\nattract sufficient loans that meet prudent credit standards, including in our commercial and industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate loan categories;\n\u2022\noriginate conforming residential mortgage loans for resale into secondary markets to provide mortgage banking income;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate liquidity and regulatory capital and comply with applicable federal and state banking regulations;\n\u2022\nobtain federal and state regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nmanage our credit, interest rate and liquidity risk;\n\u2022\ndevelop new, and grow our existing, streams of noninterest income;\n\u2022\noversee the performance of third party service providers that provide material services to our business; and\n\u2022\nmaintain expenses in line with their current projections.\nFailure to achieve these strategic goals could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategies and could negatively impact our business, growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if we do not manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be negatively affected, and we may not be able to continue to implement our business strategy and successfully conduct our operations.\nThe success of our operating model depends on our ability to attract and retain talented bankers and associates in each of our markets. If we are unable to attract and retain talented bankers in our markets, our business, growth prospects and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe success of our operating model depends on our ability to attract and retain talented bankers and associates in each of our markets. We strive to attract and retain these bankers by fostering an entrepreneurial environment, empowering them with local decision making authority and providing them with sufficient infrastructure and resources to support their growth while also providing management with appropriate oversight. However, the competition for bankers in each of our markets is intense. We compete for talent with both smaller banks that may be able to offer bankers with more responsibility, autonomy and local relationships and larger banks that may be able to offer bankers with higher\ncompensation, resources and support. As a result, we may not be able to effectively compete for talent across our markets. Furthermore, our bankers may leave us to work for our competitors and, in some instances, may take important banking and lending relationships with them to our competitors. If we are unable to attract and retain talented bankers in our markets, our business, growth prospects and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on our executive officers and other key individuals to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services and our inability to make up for such loss with qualified replacements.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key individuals. The loss of any member of our senior management team and top bankers could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer and the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Our success also depends on the experience of our market presidents, bankers and lending officers and on their relationships with the clients and communities they serve. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified and talented personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services.\nWe conduct our banking operations primarily in Tennessee, with our largest market being the Nashville MSA, which is a highly competitive banking market. Many of our competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking services within our market areas. These competitors include banks with nationwide operations, regional banks and community banks. In many instances these national and regional banks have greater resources than we do and the smaller community banks may have stronger ties in local markets than we do, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan institutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial institutions have opened production offices, or otherwise solicit deposits, in our market areas. Increased competition in our markets may result in reduced loans and deposits, as well as reduced net interest margin and profitability. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If we are unable to attract and retain banking clients, we may be unable to continue to grow our loan and deposit portfolios, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, a number of larger banks have recently entered the greater Nashville, Tennessee market, and we believe this trend will continue as banks look to gain a foothold in this growing market. This trend will likely result in greater competition in one of our key markets and may impair our ability to grow our share of the Nashville market.\nThe consummation of our proposed acquisition of the Clayton Banks is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including regulatory approvals, that are outside of our control and that we may be unable to obtain or may delay the consummation of the acquisition or result in the imposition of conditions that could reduce the anticipated benefits from the proposed acquisition or cause the parties to abandon the proposed transaction.\nConsummation of the acquisition of the Clayton Banks is conditioned upon customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, (i) receipt of all required regulatory approvals from the Federal Reserve, FDIC and the TDFI, (ii) approval by our shareholders of the issuance of the shares of our common stock to be issued as partial consideration for the acquisition, and (iii) the absence of any law, order, injunction, decree, judgment or ruling prohibiting the acquisition. We may be unable to obtain the regulatory approvals required for the acquisition, or the required regulatory approvals may delay the acquisition or result in the imposition of conditions that could reduce the anticipated benefits from the proposed acquisition or cause the parties to abandon the proposed transaction.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of the Clayton Banks, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the Clayton Banks.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of the Clayton Banks will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired businesses. The integration and combination of the acquired businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating their business practices and operations. The integration process may disrupt our business and the business of the Clayton Banks and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the acquired businesses and to\nrealize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our business activities or those of the Clayton Banks and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, loss of customers and diversion of our management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention. The challenges of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the acquisition;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company;\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel, including personnel that are considered key to the future success of the businesses of the Clayton Banks; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping key business relationships in place.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs and liabilities, decreases in the amount of expected income and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, even if the operations of the Clayton Banks are integrated successfully with our business, the full benefits of the transaction may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or earnings accretion that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses. Furthermore, the Clayton Banks may have unknown or contingent liabilities that we would assume in the acquisition and that were not discovered during the course of our due diligence. These liabilities could include exposure to unexpected asset quality problems, compliance and regulatory violations, key employee and client retention problems and other problems that could result in significant costs to us.\nAll of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction, negatively impact the price of our common stock, or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile the proposed acquisition of the Clayton Banks is pending, we may be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and operations.\nUncertainty about the effect of the proposed acquisition of the Clayton Banks on employees, customers and other persons with whom we or the Clayton Banks have a business relationship may have an adverse effect on our business, operations and stock price. In connection with the pendency of the acquisition, existing customers of the Clayton Banks could decide to no longer do business with the Clayton Banks, reducing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. In addition, certain other projects may be delayed or ceased and business decisions could be deferred. Employee retention at the Clayton Banks may be challenging during the pendency of the acquisition, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart, the benefits of the acquisition could be materially diminished.\nWe expect to incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the acquisition.\nWe have incurred, and expect to incur additional costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the acquisition. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses relating to the acquisition, including costs relating to integration planning. These costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operation.\nFailure to complete the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, future operations and stock price.\nIf the acquisition is not completed for any reason, we may be subjected to a number of material risks. The price of our common stock may significantly decline to the extent that its current market prices reflect a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed. In addition, some costs related to the acquisition must be paid by us whether or not the acquisition is completed. Furthermore, we may experience negative reactions from our customers, shareholders, market analysts and future acquisition partners and could lose employees necessary to operate our business. Additionally, if the acquisition agreement is terminated, the Company will not recognize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nWe follow a relationship-based operating model and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining bankers and other associates who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our clients and caring about our clients and associates. Furthermore, maintaining our reputation also depends on our ability to protect our brand name and associated trademarks. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our associates or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nInterest rate shifts may reduce net interest income and otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our banking assets are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Like most financial institutions, our earnings are significantly dependent on our net interest income, the principal component of our earnings, which is the difference between interest earned by us from our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest paid by us on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We expect that we will periodically experience \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this \u201cgap\u201d will negatively impact our earnings. The impact on earnings is more adverse when the slope of the yield curve flattens, that is, when short-term interest rates increase more than long-term interest rates or when long-term interest rates decrease more than short-term interest rates. Many factors impact interest rates, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, and international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nInterest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increase the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as borrowers refinance their loans at lower rates.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities and other assets. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. At the same time, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on net interest income.\nIf short-term interest rates remain at their historically low levels for a prolonged period, and assuming longer term interest rates fall further, we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest earning assets would continue to re-price downward while our interest-bearing liability rates could fail to decline in tandem. Such an occurrence would have a material adverse effect on our net interest income and our results of operations.\nDecreased residential mortgage origination volume and pricing decisions of competitors may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur mortgage operation originates and sells residential mortgage loans, services residential mortgage loans, and provides third party origination services to other community banks and mortgage companies. Changes in interest rates, housing prices, regulations by the applicable governmental authority and pricing decisions by our loan competitors may adversely affect demand for our residential mortgage loan products, the revenue realized on the sale of loans, revenues received from servicing such loans for others, and ultimately reduce our net income. New regulations, increased regulatory reviews, and/or changes in the structure of the secondary mortgage markets which we would utilize to sell mortgage loans may be introduced and may increase costs and make it more difficult to operate a residential mortgage origination business. Our revenue from mortgage banking income was $70.2 million in 2015, and was $117.8 million in 2016, however, revenue could significantly decline in future periods if interest rates were to continue rising and the other risks highlighted in this paragraph were realized.\nOur mortgage banking profitability could significantly decline if we are not able to originate and resell a high volume of mortgage loans and securities.\nMortgage production, especially refinancing activity, declines in rising interest rate environments. While we have experienced historically low interest rates, our interest rate lock volume accelerated in the third quarter of 2016, but declined in the fourth quarter due to rising rates. Our mortgage origination volume could be materially and adversely affected by rising interest rates. We expect to see declining origination volume in 2017 across the industry. Moreover, when interest rates increase further, there can be no assurance that our mortgage production will continue at current\nlevels. Furthermore, nearly half of our mortgages are originated through our consumer direct internet delivery channel, which targets national customers. As a result, loan originations through this channel are particularly susceptible to the interest rate environment and the national housing market. Because we sell a substantial portion of the mortgage loans we originate, the profitability of our mortgage banking business also depends in large part on our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and sell them in the secondary market at a gain. In fact, as rates rise, we expect increasing industry-wide competitive pressures related to changing market conditions to reduce our pricing margins and mortgage revenues generally. Thus, in addition to our dependence on the interest rate environment, we are dependent upon (i) the existence of an active secondary market and (ii) our ability to profitably sell loans or securities into that market. If our level of mortgage production declines, the profitability will depend upon our ability to reduce our costs commensurate with the reduction of revenue from our mortgage operations.\nOur ability to originate and sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans, which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by government-sponsored entities (\u201cGSEs\u201d) and other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Because the largest participants in the secondary market are Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, GSEs whose activities are governed by federal law, any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of these GSEs could, in turn, adversely affect our operations. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship by the U.S. government. The federal government has for many years considered proposals to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but the results of any such reform, and their impact on us, are difficult to predict. To date, no reform proposal has been enacted.\nOur mortgage production and servicing revenue can be volatile.\nWe earn revenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans, servicing mortgage loans and providing third party origination services to other community banks and mortgage companies. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan originations and providing third party origination services to other community banks and mortgage companies. Under the same conditions, net revenue from our mortgage servicing rights can increase through reductions in the decay, or amortization, of the mortgage servicing right asset. When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase and mortgage servicing income tends to decline given increases in the decay, or amortization, of the mortgage servicing right asset. Even though the mortgage servicing right asset can act as a \u201cnatural hedge,\u201d the hedge is not perfect, nor is it designed to be, either in amount or timing. Servicing income can also be impacted by the change in the fair value of the mortgage servicing right asset due to changes in market interest rates and other assumptions, exclusive of decay of the mortgage servicing right asset. We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We generally do not hedge all of our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring. We may use hedging instruments tied to U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR or Eurodollars that may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged. We could incur significant losses from our hedging activities. There may be periods where we elect not to use derivatives and other instruments to hedge mortgage banking interest rate risk.\nWe may be terminated as a servicer of mortgage loans, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions.\nWe act as servicer, through a subservicing contract with Cenlar Federal Savings Bank, or Cenlar, for approximately $2,791 million of mortgage loans owned by third parties as of December 31, 2016. As a servicer for those loans we have certain contractual obligations, including foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent applicable, considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan modifications or short sales. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, causing us to lose servicing income.\nFor certain investors and/or certain transactions, we may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for origination errors with respect to the loan. If we have increased repurchase obligations because of claims that we did not satisfy our obligations as a servicer, or increased loss severity on such repurchases, we may have a significant reduction to net servicing income within our mortgage banking noninterest income. We may incur costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to overturn a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process, we may have liability to the borrower and/or to any title insurer of the property sold in foreclosure if the required process was not followed. These costs and liabilities may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us. In addition, if certain documents required for a foreclosure action are missing or defective, we could be obligated to cure the defect or repurchase the loan. We may incur liability to securitization investors relating to delays or deficiencies in our processing of mortgage assignments or other documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosures. The fair value of our mortgage servicing rights may be\nnegatively affected to the extent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure costs. We may be subject to fines and other sanctions imposed by federal or state regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our foreclosure practices or in the foreclosure practices of other mortgage loan servicers. Any of these actions may harm our reputation or negatively affect our home lending or servicing business.\nWe depend on a third-party service provider for our mortgage loan servicing business and a failure by this third party to perform its obligations could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe depend on a third-party service provider, Cenlar, to provide our mortgage loan servicing business with certain primary and special servicing services that are essential to this business. Primary servicing includes the collection of regular payments, processing of tax and insurance, processing of payoffs, handling borrower inquiries and reporting to the borrower. Special servicing is focused on borrowers who are delinquent or on loans which are more complex or in need of more hands-on attention. In the event that our current third-party service provider, or any other third-party service provider that we may use in the future, fails to perform its servicing duties or performs those duties inadequately, we could experience a temporary interruption in collecting principal and interest, sustain credit losses on our loans or incur additional costs to obtain a replacement servicer and there can be no assurance that a replacement servicer could be retained in a timely manner or at similar rates. Furthermore, our servicing rights could be terminated or we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or reimburse investors due to such failures of our third party service providers.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses in some circumstances, which could harm liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn 2016, we sold nearly all of the $4.7 billion of mortgage loans held for sale that we originated. When mortgage loans are sold, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including the GSEs, about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Whole loan sale agreements require repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan, resulting in these mortgage loans being placed on our books and subjecting us to the risk of a potential default. With respect to loans that are originated through our broker or correspondent channels, the remedies available against the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not be as broad as the remedies available to purchasers, guarantors and insurers of mortgage loans against us. We face further risk that the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not have financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available. Therefore, if a purchaser, guarantor or insurer enforces its remedies against us, we may not be able to recover losses from the originating broker or correspondent. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims and are in excess of our provision for potential losses, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to grow our noninterest income, our growth prospects will be impaired.\nTaking advantage of opportunities to develop new, and expand existing, streams of noninterest income, including our mortgage business, cash management services, investment services and interchange fees, is a part of our long-term growth strategy. These lines of business are heavily regulated and as a bank holding company we may be prohibited from entering into new lines of business or may be unable to operate these lines of business profitably. Specifically, we expect a decline in our mortgage revenues in the future due to expected higher prevailing interest rates, increased competition, and seasonality leading into 2017. If we are unsuccessful in our attempts to grow our noninterest income, especially in light of the expected decline in mortgage revenues given the expectation of higher prevailing interest rates in the following years, our long-term growth will be impaired. Furthermore, focusing on these noninterest income streams may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our core banking business, which could impair our core business, financial condition and operating results. We also derive a meaningful amount of our noninterest income from non-sufficient funds and overdraft fees and such fees are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, which could result in an erosion of such fees that materially impairs our future noninterest income.\nWe may pursue acquisitions in the future, which would expose us to financial, execution and operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe may pursue acquisitions of other financial institutions, bank branches and or mortgage operations in target markets. Such an acquisition strategy will involve significant risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nfinding suitable markets for expansion;\n\u2022\nfinding suitable candidates for acquisition;\n\u2022\nfinding suitable financing sources and fund acquisitions;\n\u2022\nmaintaining asset quality;\n\u2022\nattracting and retaining qualified management;\n\u2022\nmaintaining adequate regulatory capital;\n\u2022\nobtaining federal and state regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022\nconsummating suitable acquisitions on terms that are favorable to us.\nAcquisitions of financial institutions also involve operational risks and uncertainties, and acquired companies may have unknown or contingent liabilities with no available manner of recourse that we are not able to discover during the course of our due diligence, exposure to unexpected asset quality problems, compliance or regulatory violations, key employee and client retention problems and other problems that could negatively affect our organization. We may not be able to complete future acquisitions or, if completed, we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, management, products and services of the entities that we acquire and eliminate redundancies. The integration process may also require significant time and attention from our management that they would otherwise direct toward servicing existing business and developing new business. Moreover, undiscovered liabilities as a result of an acquisition could bring civil, criminal and financial liabilities against us, our management and the management of the institutions we acquire. We also may not possess the requisite knowledge or relationships to be successful as we enter into new markets. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, we may issue additional shares of our common stock to finance our acquisitions, which could result in dilution to our existing shareholders, or incur debt to finance our acquisitions or terms that may not be favorable to us. Failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations may increase our operating costs significantly and adversely affect our business and earnings.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security, including as a result of cyber-attacks or data security breaches could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we use may be vulnerable to physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes breakdowns or disruptions in our client relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of client business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny for failure to comply with required information security standards, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nComputer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. In addition, to access our products and services, our clients may use personal smartphones, tablet PC\u2019s, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we believe we have robust information security procedures and controls, our technologies, systems, networks, and our clients\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of the Bank\u2019s or our clients\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt the Bank\u2019s or our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nThe Bank is under continuous threat of loss due to hacking and cyber-attacks especially as we continue to expand client capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyber-attack risks that we face are e-fraud and loss of sensitive client data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from client or our accounts and of which we have been a victim. Attempts to breach sensitive client data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, are less frequent but would present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to us if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers, our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels, and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our clients. While we are not aware of any successful hacking or cyber-attacks into our computer or IT systems, there can be no assurance that we will not be the victim of successful hacking or cyber-attacks in the future that could cause us to suffer material losses. The occurrence of any cyber-attack or information security breach could result in significant potential liabilities to clients and other third parties, reputational damage and the disruption of our operations, and regulatory concerns, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes and, as a result, we have a continuing need to stay current with those changes to compete effectively and increase our efficiencies. We may not have the resources to implement new technology to stay current with these changes.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving clients, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience as well as to provide secure electronic environments and create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our market area. In connection with implementing new technology enhancements or products in the future, we may experience certain operational challenges (e.g. human error, system error, incompatibility, etc.) which could result in us not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require us to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner.\nMany of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and have invested significantly more than us in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or more convenient products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our clients, which could impair our growth and profitability.\nWe depend on a number of third-party service providers and our operations could be interrupted if these third-party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. Specifically, we receive core systems processing, essential web hosting and other Internet systems, deposit processing and other processing services from third-party service providers. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties, or terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, particularly on a timely basis, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we are able to replace third party service providers, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, client or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and client misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our clients or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and client or employee fraud. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in credit applications, property appraisals, title information, equipment pricing and valuation and employment and income documentation, in deciding which loans we will originate, as well as the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which we rely is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding, the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected, or we may fund a loan that we would not have funded or on terms we would not have extended. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or another third party, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. A loan subject to a material misrepresentation is typically unsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation. The sources of the misrepresentations are often difficult to locate, and it is often difficult to recover any of the monetary losses we may suffer.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe establish our allowance for loan losses and maintain it at a level considered adequate by management, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements and supervisory guidance, to absorb probable loan losses based on our analysis of our portfolio, market environment and historical loss experience. The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon relevant information available to us. The allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships, as\nwell as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. Additions to the allowance for loan losses, which are charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses, are determined based on a variety of factors, including an analysis of the loan portfolio, historical loss experience and an evaluation of current economic conditions in our market areas. The actual amount of loan losses is affected by changes in economic, operating and other conditions within our markets, as well as changes in the financial condition, cash flows, and operations of our borrowers, all of which are beyond our control, and such losses may exceed current estimates.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 1.18% and as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was 216.22%. While our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans has decreased since 2012 as a result of the general improvement in the credit quality across all of in our markets, additional loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than we have previously experienced. We may be required to take additional provisions for loan losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for loan losses, either due to management\u2019s decision to do so or requirements by our banking regulators. In addition, bank regulatory agencies will periodically review our allowance for loan losses and the value attributed to nonaccrual loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require us to recognize future charge-offs. These adjustments may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur small to medium-sized business clients may have fewer financial resources than larger entities to weather a downturn in the economy, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur primary business clients are small to medium-sized businesses. These small to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. In addition many of our small and medium-sized business clients are rural based businesses that have limited growth opportunities compared to small and medium-sized business clients in other markets and, as a result, may not be able to generate sufficient capital to repay their loans. If general economic conditions negatively impact Tennessee, particularly the Nashville MSA, and small to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected, our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected. Furthermore, our results of operations could be further impaired due to conditions that primarily or disproportionately affect our rural or agricultural based clients, such as weather, market conditions and governmental agricultural policies.\nOur lending limit may restrict our growth and prevent us from effectively implementing our business strategy.\nWe are limited by law in the amount we can loan in the aggregate to a single borrower or related borrowers by the amount of our capital. The Bank is a Tennessee chartered bank and therefore all branches, regardless of location, fall under the legal lending limits of the state of Tennessee. Tennessee\u2019s legal lending limit is a safety and soundness measure intended to prevent one person or a relatively small and economically related group of persons from borrowing an unduly large amount of a bank\u2019s funds. It is also intended to safeguard a bank\u2019s depositors by diversifying the risk of loan losses among a relatively large number of creditworthy borrowers engaged in various types of businesses. Generally, under Tennessee law, loans and extensions of credit to a borrower may not exceed 15% of our Bank\u2019s Tier 1 capital, plus an additional 10% of the Bank\u2019s Tier 1 capital, with approval of the Bank\u2019s board. Further, the Bank may elect to conform to similar standards applicable to national banks under federal law, in lieu of Tennessee law. Because the federal law and Tennessee state law standards are determined as a percentage of the Bank\u2019s capital, these state and federal limits both increase or decrease as the Bank\u2019s capital increases or decreases. Based upon the capitalization of the Bank at December 31, 2016, the Bank\u2019s legal lending limits were approximately $42 million (15%) and $71 million (25%). Therefore, based upon our current capital levels, the amount we may lend may be significantly less than that of many of our larger competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of our lending limit from doing business with us. We may accommodate larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy may not always be available. Under certain circumstances, if a participating financial institution fails to fund their portion of the loan commitment, then we could be required to fund such participating bank\u2019s commitment, which would increase our exposure to such loan and may also impair our liquidity. Further, we may be unable to fund such commitment due to the legal lending limits described above. In addition to these legally imposed lending limits, we also employ appropriate limits on our overall loan portfolio and requirements with respect to certain types of lending and individual lending relationships. If we are unable to compete effectively for loans from our target clients, we may not be able to effectively implement our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur current asset mix and our current investments may not be indicative of our future asset mix and investments, which may make it difficult to predict our future financial and operating performance.\nCertain factors make it difficult to predict our future financial and operating performance including, among others: (i) our current asset mix may not be representative of our anticipated future asset mix and may change as we continue to execute on our plans for organic loan origination and banking activities and potentially grow through future acquisitions; (ii) our significant liquid securities portfolio may not necessarily be representative of our future liquid securities position;\nand (iii) our cost structure and capital expenditure requirements during the periods for which financial information is available may not be reflective of our anticipated cost structure and capital spending as we continue to realize efficiencies in our business, integrate future acquisitions and continue to grow our organic banking platform.\nOur funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits and support our future growth.\nDeposits and investment securities for sale are the primary source of funds for our lending activities and general business purposes. However, from time to time we also obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, purchase federal funds, and engage in overnight borrowing from the Federal Reserve, correspondent banks, and enter into client purchase agreements. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances if desired, we may not be able to replace such funds in the future if our financial condition, the financial condition of the Federal Home Loan Bank or market conditions were to change. While we believe our current funding sources to be adequate, our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. We have also meaningfully decreased our cost of deposits in recent years by increasing our noninterest bearing deposits and allowing higher-cost time deposits and borrowed funds to mature. If we are unable to successfully maintain and grow our low-cost deposits, our cost of funding will increase. Finally, if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our profitability would be adversely affected.\nFederal Home Loan Bank borrowings and other current sources of liquidity may not be available or, if available, sufficient to provide adequate funding for operations. Furthermore, our own actions could result in a loss of adequate funding. For example, our availability at the Federal Home Loan Bank could be reduced if we are deemed to have poor documentation or processes. Accordingly, we may seek additional higher-cost borrowings in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. Additional borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us or, if available, may not be available on favorable terms. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on reasonable terms, our growth and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect our operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of our investment securities, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, the sale of loans, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds consists of deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when clients perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If clients move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, including from our mortgage business, investment maturities and sales of investment securities. Additional liquidity is provided by the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank. We also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions, or issue equity or debt securities to investors in the future. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Our liquidity may also be adversely impacted if there is a decline in our mortgage revenues from the expected higher prevailing interest rates in the following years.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our shareholders, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain compliance with regulatory capital requirements, would be adversely affected.\nWe face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. In addition, the Company, on a consolidated basis, and the Bank, on a stand-alone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, which could include the possibility of financing acquisitions. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional\ncapital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. Furthermore, such additional capital could result in dilution to our existing shareholders. If we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe could recognize losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nWhile we attempt to invest a significant percentage of our assets in loans (our loan held for investment to deposit ratio was 69.2% as of December 31, 2016), we also invest a percentage of our total assets (approximately 17.8% as of December 31, 2016) in investment securities as part of our overall liquidity strategy. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of our securities portfolio was approximately $582.2 million and consisted primarily of U.S. Government agency, municipal securities and mortgage-backed securities. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities are generally subject to decreases in market value when market interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual borrowers with respect to the underlying securities, and continued instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting market interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us.\nOur risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences, such as formal or informal enforcement actions, civil money penalties and potential criminal penalties.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nWe are required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements as a publicly-traded company, including those required by the SEC. Complying with these reporting and other regulatory requirements is time-consuming and has resulted, and will continue to result, in increased costs to us and could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we intend to take advantage of certain reduced regulatory and reporting requirements and our costs of being a public company will likely increase further once we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We are inexperienced with these reporting and accounting requirements, and as such these requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we will need to continue to commit significant resources and provide additional management oversight. In connection with and following our initial public offering, we have implemented additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies and may continue to incur additional costs as we grow to address these standards and requirements. Sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our firm and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities will likely divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, including implementing our growth strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth.\nWe could be subject to environmental risks and associated costs on our foreclosed real estate assets, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of loans collateralized by real estate. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic waste could be discovered on the properties that secure our loans. If we acquire such properties as a result of foreclosure, we could be held responsible for the cost of cleaning up or removing this waste, and this cost could exceed the value of the underlying properties and materially and adversely affect us.\nWe may be adversely affected by the lack of soundness of other financial institutions or market utilities.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions or market utilities, or the financial services industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.\nThe borrowing needs of our clients may be unpredictable, especially during a challenging economic environment. We may not be able to meet our unfunded credit commitments, or adequately reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nA commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established under the agreement. The actual borrowing needs of our clients under these credit commitments have historically been lower than the contractual amount of the commitments. A significant portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. Because of the credit profile of our clients, we typically have a substantial amount of total unfunded credit commitments, which is reflected off our balance sheet. Actual borrowing needs of our clients may exceed our expected funding requirements, especially during a challenging economic environment when our client companies may be more dependent on our credit commitments due to the lack of available credit elsewhere, the increasing costs of credit, or the limited availability of financings from venture firms. In addition, limited partner investors of our venture capital clients may fail to meet their underlying investment commitments due to liquidity or other financing issues, which may increase our clients\u2019 borrowing needs. Any failure to meet our unfunded credit commitments in accordance with the actual borrowing needs of our clients may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nOur financial condition may be affected negatively by the costs of litigation.\nWe may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations or similar matters arising out of our business. In many cases, we may seek reimbursement from our insurance carriers to cover such costs and expenses. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPrior to our initial public offering, we were treated as an S Corporation, and claims of taxing authorities related to our prior status as an S Corporation could harm us.\nFollowing our initial public offering, our status as an S Corporation was terminated and we became a \u201cC Corporation\u201d under the provisions of Sections 301 - 385 of the Code. If the unaudited, open tax years in which we were an S Corporation are audited by the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, and we are determined not to have qualified for, or to have violated, our S Corporation status, we will be obligated to pay back tax, interest and penalties. The amounts that we would be obligated to pay could include tax on all of our taxable income while we were an S Corporation. Any such claims could result in additional costs to us and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with our initial public offering, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Mr. Ayers, and under this agreement, we could become obligated to make payments to Mr. Ayers for any additional federal, state or local income taxes assessed against him for tax periods prior our initial public offering.\nPrior to our initial public offering, we were an S Corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. While we were an S Corporation, Mr. Ayers, our sole shareholder at the time, as an individual was taxed on our income. Therefore Mr. Ayers received certain distributions (\u201ctax distributions\u201d) from us that were generally intended to equal the amount of tax Mr. Ayers was required to pay with respect to our income. In connection with our initial public offering, our S Corporation status was terminated and we thereafter became subject to federal and increased state income taxes. In the event of an adjustment to our reported taxable income for periods prior to termination of our S Corporation status, it is possible that Mr. Ayers would be liable for additional income taxes for those prior periods. Therefore, we entered into a tax sharing\nagreement with Mr. Ayers. Pursuant to this agreement, upon our filing any tax return (amended or otherwise), in the event of any restatement of our taxable income or pursuant to a determination by, or a settlement with, a taxing authority, for any period during which we were an S Corporation, we may be required to make a payment to Mr. Ayers in an amount equal to Mr. Ayers\u2019 incremental tax liability, which amount may be material. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify Mr. Ayers with respect to unpaid income tax liabilities to the extent that such unpaid income tax liabilities are attributable to an adjustment to our taxable income for any period after our S Corporation status terminates. In both cases the amount of the payment will be based on the assumption that Mr. Ayers is taxed at the highest rate applicable to individuals for the relevant periods. We will also indemnify Mr. Ayers for any interest, penalties, losses, costs or expenses arising out of any claim under the agreement. However, Mr. Ayers will indemnify us with respect to our unpaid tax liabilities (including interest and penalties) to the extent that such unpaid tax liabilities are attributable to a decrease in the shareholder\u2019s taxable income for any for tax period and a corresponding increase in the Company\u2019s taxable income for any period.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Such changes may result in us being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators or outside auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in our needing to revise or restate prior period financial statements.\nRisks related to our regulatory environment\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation at federal and state level by multiple regulatory bodies. These regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services. If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred, which may adversely affect our business operations. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we provide as well as our costs of compliance with such regulations. In addition, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain clients.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act brought about a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry, addressing, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits, mortgage lending practices, registration of investment advisors and changes among the bank regulatory agencies. Key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that have impacted or are likely to impact our operations include:\n\u2022\ncreation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), with centralized authority, including rulemaking, examination and enforcement authority, for consumer protection in the banking industry.\n\u2022\nnew and heightened regulatory requirements affecting consumer mortgages, and impacting the secondary mortgage market.\n\u2022\nnew limitations on federal preemption.\n\u2022\nnew prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and nonbank financial company to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund (the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d).\n\u2022\napplication of new regulatory capital requirements, including changes to leverage and risk-based capital standards and changes to the components of permissible tiered capital.\n\u2022\nchanges to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums.\n\u2022\npermanently raising the FDIC\u2019s standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance.\n\u2022\nrepeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.\n\u2022\nrestrictions on compensation, including a prohibition on incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses.\n\u2022\nrequirement that sponsors of asset-backed securities retain a percentage of the credit risk of the assets underlying the securities.\n\u2022\nrequirement that banking regulators remove references to and requirements of reliance upon credit ratings from their regulations and replace them with appropriate alternatives for evaluating credit worthiness.\nSome of these and other major changes could materially impact the profitability of our business, the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for our loans, require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs, taxes, liabilities, enforcement actions and reputational risk. Many of these provisions became effective upon enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, while others were subject to further study, rulemaking, and the discretion of regulatory bodies and have only recently taken effect or will take effect in coming years. In light of these significant changes and the discretion afforded to federal regulators, we cannot fully predict the effect that compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act or any implementing regulations will have on our businesses or ability to pursue future business opportunities. Additional regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further alter regulation of the financial services industry. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Certain aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities, require more oversight or change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply, and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSuch proposals and legislation, if finally adopted, would change banking laws, our operating environment and the operating environment of our subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. We cannot determine whether such proposals and legislation will be adopted, or the ultimate effect that such proposals and legislation, if enacted, or regulations issued to implement the same, would have upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. Also, in recent years, regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially, imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with our operations. If these regulatory trends continue, they could adversely affect our business and, in turn, our consolidated results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Federal Reserve, which examines us and the Bank, requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the federal bank regulators to require that all companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of strength for the institution. Under these requirements, in the future, we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank if it experiences financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it, and therefore we may be required to borrow the funds. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFederal and state banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we become subject as a result of such examinations could materially and adversely affect us.\nTennessee and federal banking agencies, including the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a Tennessee or federal banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that the Company or its management was in violation of any law or regulation, including violations of consumer financial services protection laws and regulations, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to change the asset composition of our portfolio or balance sheet, to assess civil monetary penalties against the Bank, our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place the bank in receivership or conservatorship. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, we could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by the creditworthiness and liquidity of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by, or questions or concerns about the creditworthiness of, a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFederal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered \u201cpredatory.\u201d These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. Since 2013, the CFPB has issued several rules on mortgage lending, notably a rule requiring all home mortgage lenders to determine a borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan. The origination of loans with certain terms and conditions and that otherwise meet the definition of a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d may protect us from liability to a borrower for failing to make the necessary determinations. In either case, we may find it necessary to tighten our mortgage loan underwriting standards in response to the CFPB rules, which may constrain our ability to make loans consistent with our business strategies. It is our policy not to make predatory loans and to determine borrowers\u2019 ability to repay, but the law and related rules create the potential for increased liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, CFPB and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and engages in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and IRS. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control related to U.S. sanctions regimes. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. See \u201cBusiness: Supervision and regulation.\u201d\nRisks related to our common stock\nApplicable laws and regulations restrict both the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to FB Financial and the ability of FB Financial to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nBoth FB Financial and the Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends. In addition, the Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business. These federal and state laws, regulations and policies are described in greater detail in \u201cBusiness: Supervision and regulation: Bank regulation: Bank dividends\u201d and \u201cBusiness: Supervision and regulation: Holding company regulation: Restriction on bank holding company dividends,\u201d but generally look to factors such as previous results and net income, capital needs, asset quality, existence of enforcement or remediation proceedings, and overall financial condition. For the foreseeable future, the majority, if not all, of the Company\u2019s revenue will be from any dividends paid to the Company by the Bank. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends also depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us. Furthermore, the present and future dividend policy of the Bank is subject to the discretion of its board of directors. We cannot guarantee that the Company or the Bank will be permitted by financial condition or applicable regulatory restrictions to pay dividends, that the board of directors of the Bank will elect to pay dividends to us, nor can we guarantee the timing or amount of any dividend actually paid. See \u201cDividend policy.\u201d\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to repay indebtedness and to fund the development and growth of our business. We do not intend to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any, will be your only source of gain on an investment in our common stock.\nWe are controlled by James W. Ayers, whose interests in our business may be different than yours.\nMr. Ayers, our Executive Chairman, currently owns approximately 71.3% of our common stock. Furthermore, pursuant to the shareholder\u2019s agreement that was entered into with Mr. Ayers in connection with our initial public offering, Mr. Ayers has the right to designate up to a majority of our board of directors. As a result, Mr. Ayers or his nominees to our board of directors will have the ability to control the appointment of our management, the entering into of mergers, material acquisitions and dispositions and other extraordinary transactions and to influence amendments to our charter, bylaws and other corporate governance documents. So long as Mr. Ayers continues to own a majority of our common stock, he will have the ability to control the vote in any election of directors and will have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires shareholder approval regardless of whether others believe the transaction is in our best interests. In any of these matters, the interests of Mr. Ayers may differ from or conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock to the extent investors perceive disadvantages in owning stock of a company with a controlling shareholder.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of NYSE and, as a result, qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a result, you will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nMr. Ayers controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of NYSE. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors and to have executive compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee consisting entirely of independent directors.\nWe may take advantage of certain of these exemptions for as long as we continue to qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d, and have relied on this exemption to not have a nominating and corporate governance committee. While exempt, we may also choose not to have a majority of independent directors or compensation committee that consists entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of NYSE.\nThere are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding companies.\nWe are a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve. Subject to certain exceptions, the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended (\u201cCIBCA\u201d), and its implementing regulations require that any individual or company acquiring \u201ccontrol\u201d of a bank or bank holding company, either directly or indirectly, give the Federal Reserve 60 days\u2019 prior written notice of the proposed acquisition. If within that time period the Federal Reserve has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, extended the period for an additional period up to 90 days or requested additional information, the acquisition may proceed. An acquisition may be made before expiration of the disapproval period if the Federal Reserve issues written notice that it intends not to disapprove the acquisition. Acquisition of 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities constitutes control, and it is generally presumed for purposes of the CIBCA that the acquisition of 10 percent or more of any class of voting securities would constitute the acquisition of control, although such a presumption of control may be rebutted.\nAlso, under the CIBCA, the shareholdings of individuals and companies that are deemed to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d would be aggregated for purposes of determining whether such holders \u201ccontrol\u201d a bank or bank holding company. \u201cActing in concert\u201d under the CIBCA generally means knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action towards the common goal of acquiring control of a bank or a bank holding company, whether or not pursuant to an express agreement. The manner in which this definition is applied in individual circumstances can vary and cannot always be predicted with certainty. Many factors can lead to a rebuttable presumption of acting in concert, including where: (i) the shareholders are commonly controlled or managed; (ii) the shareholders are parties to an oral or written agreement or understanding regarding the acquisition, voting or transfer of control of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company; (iii) the shareholders are immediate family members; or (iv) both a shareholder and a controlling shareholder, partner, trustee or management official of such shareholder own equity in the bank or bank holding company.\nFurthermore, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (\u201cBHCA\u201d) and its implementing regulations, and subject to certain exceptions, any company would be required to obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to obtaining control of a bank or bank holding company. Control under the BHCA exists where a company acquires 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities, has the ability to elect a majority of a bank holding company\u2019s directors, is found to exercise a \u201ccontrolling influence\u201d over a bank or bank holding company\u2019s management and policies, and in certain other circumstances. There is a presumption of non-control for any holder of less than 5% of any class of voting securities. In addition, in 2008 the Federal Reserve issued a policy statement on equity investments in banks and bank holding companies, which sets out circumstances under which a minority investor would not be deemed to control a bank or bank holding company for purposes of the BHCA. Among other things, the 2008 policy statement permits a minority investor to hold up to 24.9% (or 33.3% under certain circumstances) of the total equity (voting and non-voting combined) and have at least one representative on the company\u2019s board of directors (with two directors permitted under certain circumstances).\nRegulatory determination of \u201ccontrol\u201d of a depository institution or holding company, under either the BHCA or CIBCA, is based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. Potential investors are advised to consult with their legal counsel regarding the applicable regulations and requirements.\nOur corporate organization documents and the provisions of Tennessee law to which we are subject contain certain provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, make more difficult or prevent an attempted acquisition of the Company that you may favor.\nOur charter and bylaws contain various provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control of the Company. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na provision that directors cannot be removed except for cause;\n\u2022\na provision that any special meeting of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\na provision that requires the affirmative vote of eighty percent (80%) of the shares outstanding to amend certain provisions of the Company\u2019s charter; and\n\u2022\na provision establishing certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered only at an annual or special meeting of shareholders.\nOur charter provides for noncumulative voting for directors and authorizes the board of directors to issue shares of its preferred stock without shareholder approval and upon such terms as the board of directors may determine. The issuance of our preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, financings and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a controlling interest in us. In addition, certain provisions of Tennessee law, including a provision which restricts certain business combinations between a Tennessee corporation and certain affiliated shareholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control of the Company. Also, our charter prohibits shareholder action by written consent.\nWe have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets, including our stock in the Bank, to secure that debt.\nWe have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets to secure that debt. Absent special and unusual circumstances, a holder of indebtedness for borrowed money has rights that are superior to those of holders of common stock. For example, interest must be paid to the lender before dividends can be paid to the shareholders, and loans must be paid off before any assets can be distributed to shareholders if we were to liquidate. Furthermore, we would have to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, which could reduce our profitability or result in net losses on a consolidated basis even if the Bank were profitable.\nThe price of our common stock could be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly and annual results of operations;\n\u2022\nrecommendations or lack thereof by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet market predictions of our earnings;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry, including the failures of other financial institutions in the recent economic downturn;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by our controlling shareholder, Mr. Ayers, or members of our management team;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors; and\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management. Furthermore, bank stocks in Tennessee have enjoyed higher trading multiples compared to bank stocks in other markets and there is no guarantee that this trend will continue or if we will benefit from these same multiples.\nFuture equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause our common stock price to decline.\nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock up to the authorized shares in our charter. We may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future pursuant to current or future employee stock option plans, employee stock grants, upon exercise of warrants or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. In addition, we intend to issue 5,860,000 shares of our common stock as partial consideration for our acquisition of the Clayton Banks. If we choose to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities may dilute your ownership in us and may adversely affect us or the market price of our common stock.\nWe or Mr. Ayers, may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings. We may also issue additional shares of common stock or convertible debt securities to finance future acquisitions (including the 5,860,000 shares of our common stock and $60 million in subordinated debt that we intend to issue to Clayton HC as partial consideration for the acquisition of the Clayton Banks). As of December 31, 2016, we had 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized and 24,107,660 shares of common stock outstanding, of which 17,180,000 shares, or 71.3%, are held by Mr. Ayers. The shares held by Mr. Ayers and any shares that are held by our executive officers and directors became available for sale following the expiration on March 14, 2017 of the lock-up restrictions entered into in connection with our initial public offering, subject to compliance with the applicable requirements under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including sales that may occur pursuant to Mr. Ayers or Clayton HC\u2019s registration rights and shares that may be issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected if the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies are inaccurate.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which are included in the section captioned \u201cManagement\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\u201d in this annual report, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider \u201ccritical\u201d because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially affect our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, those events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to reconciliations of our mortgage loans held for sale and related clearing accounts and if we are unable to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act it could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nDue to a transition period established by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for newly public companies, we are not currently required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) until the year following our first annual report is required to be filed with the SEC. Thus, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include a report of management\u2019s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of the company\u2019s registered public accounting firm. We are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Section 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and, beginning in 2017, provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of control over financial reporting. Though we are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis, we will not be required to make our first annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Pursuant to the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years following our initial public offering.\nIn connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management has determined that as of December 31, 2016, we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting resulting from deficiencies around the recording of mortgage banking transactions and reconciliations of mortgage loans held for sale and related clearing accounts on a timely basis. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, we did not have effective processes and procedures in place to ensure that all transactions involving the origination, purchase, transfer or sales of our mortgage loans held for sale were properly recorded and reflected on our financial statements and, as a result, failed to properly record certain transactions in the proper interim periods in 2016. While this deficiency did not result in a restatement of any previously reported interim consolidated financial statements for 2016, our management concluded there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. See \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d included in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of this material weakness.\nWhile we believe that we are taking appropriate steps to remediate the material weakness, we cannot be certain that the steps will successfully remediate the material weakness or that other material weaknesses and control deficiencies will not be discovered in the future. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. In addition, if we are unable to successfully remediate the material weakness, if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, or if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements.\nInternal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. If we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we and our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Testing and maintaining internal controls could also divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various regulatory and reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, exemptions from being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if we comply with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as we are an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, though we will cease to be an emerging growth company earlier if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual gross revenues, have more than $700.0 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in a three-year period. Investors and securities analysts may find it more difficult to evaluate our common stock because we will rely on one or more of these exemptions, and, as a result, investor confidence and the market price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is not guaranteed by the FDIC, so you could lose some or all of your investment.\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss or guaranteed by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. An investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described herein. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.", "PERMNO": 16319, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FBK"}
