Before deciding to invest in our company or deciding to maintain or increase your investment, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below. The risks and uncertainties described below and in our other filings with the SEC are not the only risks we face. If one or more of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline, and you may lose your entire investment.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following is a summary of certain important factors that may make an investment in our Company speculative or risky. You should carefully consider the fuller risk factor disclosure set forth in this Annual Report, in addition to the other information herein, including the section of this report titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and related notes.\n\u2022Our pursuit of a COVID-19 drug candidate is at an early stage. We may be unable to produce a drug that successfully treats the virus in a timely manner, if at all.\n\u2022The coronavirus pandemic has caused interruptions or delays of our business plan and may have a significant adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022Immunic has a limited operating history with its current business plan, has incurred significant losses since 2016, anticipates that it will continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability. The absence of any commercial sales and Immunic\u2019s limited operating history make it difficult to assess its future viability.\n\u2022Immunic currently has no source of product sales revenue and may never be profitable.\n\u2022Immunic will require substantial additional funding, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force Immunic to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its product development, other operations or future commercialization efforts.\n\u2022Raising additional capital may cause dilution to Immunic\u2019s existing stockholders, restrict its operations or require Immunic to relinquish rights to its technologies or product candidates.\n\u2022The marketing approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if Immunic is ultimately unable to obtain marketing approval for its product candidates, its business will be substantially harmed.\n\u2022Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome.\n\u2022Clinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Because the results of earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate Immunic advances through clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive marketing approval.\n\u2022Immunic\u2019s product candidates may cause undesirable adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their marketing approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if obtained.\n\u2022Immunic is heavily dependent on the success of its product candidates, which are in the early stages of clinical development. Immunic cannot give any assurance that it will generate data for any of its product\ncandidates sufficient to receive regulatory approval in its planned indications, which will be required before they can be commercialized.\n\u2022Due to Immunic\u2019s limited resources and access to capital, it must decide to prioritize development of its current product candidates for certain indications and at certain doses. These decisions may prove to have been wrong and may materially adversely affect Immunic\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\u2022If Immunic fails to attract and retain key management and scientific personnel, it may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize its product candidates.\n\u2022Even if Immunic obtains the required regulatory approvals in the United States and other territories, the commercial success of its product candidates will depend on market awareness and acceptance of its product candidates.\n\u2022Immunic currently has limited marketing and sales experience. If Immunic is unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell its product candidates, Immunic may be unable to generate any revenue.\n\u2022If Immunic fails to enter into strategic relationships or collaborations, its business, financial condition, commercialization prospects and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022Immunic faces substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before, or more successfully, than Immunic does.\n\u2022The size of the potential market for our product candidates is difficult to estimate and, if any of our assumptions are inaccurate, the actual markets for our product candidates may be smaller than our estimates.\n\u2022Immunic may be unable to realize the potential benefits of any collaboration.\n\u2022Immunic\u2019s proprietary rights may not adequately protect its technologies and product candidates.\n\u2022Immunic may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights throughout the world.\n\u2022Intellectual property rights do not protect against all potential threats to Immunic\u2019s competitive advantage.\n\u2022Immunic incurs significant costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\n\u2022The market price of Immunic\u2019s common stock is volatile.\n\u2022Immunic does not anticipate that it will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nOur pursuit of a COVID-19 drug candidate is at an early stage. We may be unable to produce a drug that successfully treats the virus in a timely manner, if at all.\nIn response to the global coronavirus pandemic and based on preclinical data, we have started and are in the process of conducting an antiviral clinical trial for IMU-838, our lead product candidate and a selective oral DHODH inhibitor. Our clinical development program for IMU-838 as a potential treatment option for patients with COVID-19 is in early stages, we may be unable to recruit enough patients based on limited disease prevalence in the\ncountries in which we are recruiting trial participants, we may not be able to show any activity of IMU-838 in COVID-19, our COVID-19 drug candidate may not prove to be safe for the treatment of COVID-19, and we may be unable to produce a drug that successfully treats COVID-19 in a timely manner, if at all. We are also committing financial resources and personnel to the development of a drug to target COVID-19, which may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs. Our business could be negatively impacted by our allocation of significant resources to a global health threat that is unpredictable and could rapidly dissipate or against which, our drug, if developed, may not be effective or safe. Furthermore, there are a number of preventative vaccines in development with two having received an Emergency Use Authorization approval and others potentially nearing regulatory approval. Additionally, the United States and other countries throughout the world have recently begun to approve and commence distributing COVID-19 vaccines in their jurisdictions. The broad distribution of COVID-19 vaccines may limit the availability of governmental and quasi-governmental funding and limit the commercial viability of any approved product candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has caused interruptions or delays of our business plan and may have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nIn an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including the United States, Canada, the European Union and China, have imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel, quarantines and other public health safety measures. The extent to which the pandemic may continue to impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, but the development of clinical supply materials could be delayed and enrollment of patients in our ongoing studies may be delayed or suspended, as hospitals and clinics in areas where we are conducting trials have shifted resources to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and may limit access or close clinical facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, if our trial participants are unable to travel to our clinical study sites as a result of quarantines or other restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience higher discontinuation rates or delays in our clinical studies, as occurred in our investigator-sponsored trial of IMU-838 in PSC being conducted at the Mayo Clinic. Government-imposed quarantines and restrictions may also require us to temporarily terminate our clinical sites. Furthermore, if we determine that our trial participants may suffer from exposure to COVID-19 as a result of their participation in our clinical trials, we may voluntarily terminate certain clinical sites as a safety measure until we reasonably believe that the likelihood of exposure has subsided. As a result, our expected development timelines for our product candidates may be negatively impacted. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected and may continue to affect the operations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory authorities, which could result in delays of reviews and approvals with respect to our product candidates. We cannot predict the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as consequences of such an event are highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts that have affected and may continue to affect our business, or our clinical studies in general; however, the COVID-19 pandemic may materially disrupt or delay our business operations, further divert the attention and efforts of the medical community to coping with COVID-19, disrupt the marketplace in which we operate, and/or have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nAdditionally, Phase 1 trials are ongoing for drug candidates IMU-935 and IMU-856 in Australia. Such Phase 1 trials are customarily conducted in healthy volunteers who have no potential benefits from participation in such trials. Hence, Phase 1 trials usually are subject to more strict evaluation and assessments during pandemic periods. Such Phase 1 trials may for that reason be interrupted or delayed.\nMoreover, the various precautionary measures taken by many governmental authorities throughout the world in order to limit the spread of COVID-19 has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the global markets and global economy generally, including on the availability and pricing of employees, resources, materials, manufacturing and delivery efforts and other aspects of the global economy. There have been business closures and a substantial global reduction in economic activity as a result of COVID-19. Significant uncertainty remains as to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy. We cannot currently predict the duration of the pandemic or its impact on global or regional economic activity. The COVID-19 pandemic could materially disrupt our business and operations, interrupt our sources of supply, hamper our ability to raise additional funds or sell our securities, continue to slow down the overall economy or curtail consumer spending.\nRisks Related to Immunic\u2019s Business and Financial Condition\nImmunic has a limited operating history with its current business plan, has incurred significant losses since 2016, anticipates that it will continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability. The absence of any commercial sales and Immunic\u2019s limited operating history make it difficult to assess its future viability.\nImmunic is a development-stage pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history with its current business plan. Immunic\u2019s net losses were $44.0 million and $34.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, Immunic had an accumulated deficit of $103.9 million to date and has not generated any revenue from its current product candidates. Moreover, Immunic AG, the company\u2019s operating subsidiary, has only a limited operating history upon which stockholders can evaluate its business and prospects, is not profitable and has incurred losses in each year since its inception in 2016. In addition, Immunic has limited experience and has not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biotechnology industry.\nImmunic has devoted substantially all of its financial resources to identify, acquire and develop its product candidates, including providing general and administrative support for its operations. Immunic expects its losses to increase as it conducts clinical trials and continues to develop its lead product candidates. Immunic expects to invest significant funds into the research and development of its current product candidates to determine the potential to advance these product candidates to regulatory approval. To date, Immunic has financed its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities. The amount of its future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of its future expenditures and its ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations or grants.\nImmunic does not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until it is able to obtain marketing approval for, and successfully commercialize, any current or future product candidate. However pharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. In addition, if Immunic obtains regulatory approval to market a product candidate, its future revenue will depend upon the size of any markets in which its product candidates may receive regulatory approval, and its ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, pricing, reimbursement from third-party payors, and adequate market share for its product candidates. Even if Immunic eventually obtains adequate market share for its product candidates, to the extent they receive regulatory and market approval, the potential markets for its product candidates are may not be large enough for Immunic to become profitable.\nImmunic expects to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future, and its expenses will increase substantially if and as Immunic:\n\u2022continues the clinical development of its product candidates;\n\u2022continues efforts to discover, develop and/or acquire new product candidates;\n\u2022undertakes the manufacturing of its product candidates for clinical development and, potentially, commercialization, or increases volumes manufactured by third parties;\n\u2022advances its programs into larger, more expensive clinical trials;\n\u2022initiates additional preclinical, clinical, or other trials or studies for its product candidates;\n\u2022seeks regulatory and marketing approvals and reimbursement for its product candidates;\n\u2022experiences any delays or encounters issues with the development and process for regulatory approval of its product candidates such as safety issues, clinical trial accrual delays, longer follow-up for planned studies, additional major studies or supportive studies necessary to support marketing approval;\n\u2022establishes a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which Immunic may obtain marketing approval and market for itself;\n\u2022makes milestone, royalty or other payments under any third-party license agreements;\n\u2022seeks to maintain, protect and expand its intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022seeks to retain current skilled personnel and attract additional personnel; and\n\u2022adds operational, financial and management, and information systems personnel, including personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts.\nFurther, the net losses Immunic incurs may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of its results of operations may not be a good indication of its future performance. Failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of the company and could impair its ability to raise capital, expand its business, maintain its development efforts, expand its pipeline of product candidates or continue its operations.\nImmunic currently has no source of product sales revenue and may never be profitable.\nImmunic has not generated any revenues from commercial sales of any of its current product candidates. Immunic\u2019s ability to generate product revenue depends upon its ability to successfully commercialize these product candidates or other product candidates that it may develop, in-license or acquire in the future. Immunic does not anticipate generating revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. Immunic\u2019s ability to generate revenue from its current or future product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including its ability to:\n\u2022successfully complete research and clinical development of current and future product candidates;\n\u2022establish and maintain supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties, and ensure adequate and legally compliant manufacturing of product candidates;\n\u2022obtain regulatory approval from relevant regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where Immunic intends to market its product candidates;\n\u2022launch and commercialize any product candidates for which Immunic obtains marketing approval, and if launched independently, successfully establish a sales force and marketing and distribution infrastructure;\n\u2022obtain coverage and adequate product reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors;\n\u2022achieve market acceptance for any approved products;\n\u2022establish, maintain and protect its intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022attract, hire and retain qualified personnel.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with clinical product development, including that Immunic\u2019s product candidates may not advance through development or achieve regulatory approval, Immunic is unable to predict the timing or amount of any potential future product sale revenues. Immunic\u2019s expenses also could increase beyond expectations if Immunic decides to or is required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to perform studies or trials in addition to those that Immunic currently anticipates. Even if Immunic completes the development and regulatory processes described above, Immunic anticipates incurring significant costs associated with launching and commercializing any product candidates that may be approved.\nImmunic will require substantial additional funding, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force Immunic to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its product development, other operations or future commercialization efforts.\nSince the inception of Immunic AG, substantially all of its resources have been dedicated to the clinical development of its product candidates. Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical and non-clinical studies and clinical trials, is a very time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. We have consumed substantial amounts of cash since our inception. For example, in the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we used net cash of $46.1 million and $28.5 million, respectively, in our operating activities, substantially all of which related to development of our current product candidates. Immunic believes that it will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future on the completion of clinical development and regulatory preparedness of its product candidates, preparations for a commercial launch\nof any approved product candidates, and development of any other current or future product candidates it may choose to further develop. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining marketing approvals, and manufacturing and supply as well as marketing and selling any products approved for sale. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of any drug development process is highly uncertain, Immunic cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of any approved current or future product candidates.\nImmunic\u2019s operating plan may change as a result of factors currently unknown to Immunic, and it may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations. Such financing may result in dilution to Immunic\u2019s stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect its business. In addition, Immunic may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if Immunic believes it has sufficient funds for its current or future operating plans.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2022. Our estimate as to how long we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to continue to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Further, changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume cash and cash equivalents significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Immunic\u2019s future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing Immunic\u2019s current product candidates, future product candidates and related preclinical and clinical trials;\n\u2022the cost of commercialization activities if Immunic\u2019s current product candidates and future product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs and preparedness of its corporate infrastructure;\n\u2022the cost of manufacturing current product candidates and future product candidates that Immunic may obtain approval for and successfully commercialize;\n\u2022Immunic\u2019s ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u2022the number and characteristics of any additional product candidates Immunic may develop or acquire;\n\u2022any product liability or other lawsuits related to Immunic\u2019s products or otherwise commenced against Immunic;\n\u2022the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u2022the costs associated with being a public company;\n\u2022the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing Immunic\u2019s intellectual property rights, including litigation costs and the outcome of any such litigation; and\n\u2022the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, any future approved products.\nAdditional funds may not be available when Immunic needs them, on terms that are acceptable to Immunic, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to Immunic on a timely basis, Immunic may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate:\n\u2022preclinical studies, clinical trials or other development activities for Immunic\u2019s current product candidates or any future product candidates;\n\u2022its research and development activities; or\n\u2022its establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize its future product candidates.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to Immunic\u2019s existing stockholders, restrict its operations or require Immunic to relinquish rights to its technologies or product candidates.\nImmunic may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic collaborations and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that Immunic raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of Immunic\u2019s stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of such equity or convertible debt securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of Immunic\u2019s stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on Immunic\u2019s ability to incur additional debt, acquire or license intellectual property rights, redeem stock or declare dividends, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact Immunic\u2019s ability to conduct its business. If Immunic raises additional funds through strategic collaborations and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, Immunic may have to relinquish valuable rights to its technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to Immunic.\nOur finance contract (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) with the European Investment Bank (\u201cEIB\u201d) contains various covenants which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment under the facility, thereby materially and adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor so long as any amount is outstanding under the Loan Agreement with EIB, we are subject to covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, sell assets, and consolidate or merge. Failure to comply with certain covenants could result in an event of default which, if we were unable to obtain a waiver from EIB, could result in an acceleration of repayment under the facility and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the restrictive covenants contained in the Loan Agreement could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nRisks Related to the Clinical Development and Marketing Approval of Immunic\u2019s Product Candidates\nThe marketing approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if Immunic is ultimately unable to obtain marketing approval for its product candidates, its business will be substantially harmed.\nNone of Immunic\u2019s current product candidates have gained marketing approval for sale in the United States or any other country, and Immunic cannot guarantee that it will ever have marketable products. Immunic\u2019s business is substantially dependent on its ability to complete the development of, obtain marketing approval for, and successfully commercialize its product candidates in a timely manner. Immunic cannot commercialize its product candidates in the United States without first obtaining approval from the FDA to market each product candidate. Similarly, Immunic cannot commercialize its product candidates outside of the United States without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Immunic\u2019s product candidates could fail to receive marketing approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of Immunic\u2019s clinical trials;\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may find the human subject protections for Immunic\u2019s clinical trials inadequate and place a clinical hold on (i) an IND application at the time of its submission, precluding commencement of any trials, or (ii) one or more clinical trials at any time during the conduct of such trials;\n\u2022Immunic may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u2022the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u2022Immunic may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with Immunic\u2019s interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022the data collected from clinical trials of Immunic\u2019s product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an application to obtain marketing approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may find inadequate the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which Immunic contracts for clinical and commercial supplies of its product candidates; and\n\u2022the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner that would delay marketing approval.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval for the commercial sale of any drug product for a target indication, Immunic must demonstrate in preclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA, that the product is safe and effective for its intended use and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate to preserve the drug\u2019s identity, strength, quality and purity. In the United States, it is necessary to submit and obtain approval of a new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d) from the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees ($2,875,842 for 2021); under certain limited circumstances, a waiver of such fees may be obtained. An NDA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish the product safety and efficacy for each desired indication. The NDA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product. After the submission of an NDA, but before approval of the NDA, the manufacturing facilities used to manufacture a product candidate must be inspected by the FDA to ensure compliance with the applicable current good manufacturing practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements. The FDA, the competent authorities of the member states of the European Economic Area, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities may also inspect Immunic\u2019s clinical trial sites and audit clinical study data to ensure that its studies are properly conducted in accordance with the IND regulations, human subject protection regulations, and current good clinical practice (\u201ccGCP\u201d).\nUnder the current Prescription Drug User Fee Act (\u201cPDUFA\u201d) guidelines, FDA goal for acting on the submission of an NDA for a new molecular entity is ten months from the date of \u201cfiling.\u201d The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days after submission to determine whether it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, before accepting the NDA for filing. This two month preliminary review effectively extends the typical NDA review period to twelve months. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.\nObtaining approval of an NDA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and approval may not be obtained. Immunic cannot be certain that any submissions will be accepted for filing and reviewed by the FDA, or ultimately be approved. If an application is not accepted for review, the FDA may require that Immunic conduct additional clinical studies or preclinical testing, or take other actions before it will reconsider Immunic\u2019s application. If the FDA requires additional studies or data, Immunic would incur increased costs and delays in the marketing approval process, which may require Immunic to expend more resources than Immunic has available. In addition, the FDA may not consider any additional information to be complete or sufficient to support the filing or approval of the NDA.\nRegulatory authorities outside of the United States, such as in Europe and Japan and in emerging markets, also have requirements for approval of drugs for commercial sale with which Immunic must comply prior to marketing in those jurisdictions. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of Immunic\u2019s product candidates into the relevant markets. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted or the results may not be found adequate by regulatory authorities in other countries, and obtaining regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. However, the failure to obtain regulatory approval in one jurisdiction could have a negative impact on Immunic\u2019s ability to obtain approval in a different jurisdiction. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product candidate testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could require additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and\ntime-consuming. Foreign regulatory approval may be subject to all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. For all of these reasons, Immunic may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all.\nThe process to develop, obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize product candidates both inside and outside of the United States is long, complex and costly, and approval is never guaranteed. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable regulatory foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary between jurisdictions. Even if Immunic\u2019s product candidates were to successfully obtain approval from regulatory authorities, any such approval might significantly limit the approved indications for use, including conditioning approval on the requirement of (i) more limited patient populations, (ii) precautions, warnings or contraindications on the product labeling, including \u201cblack box\u201d warnings, (iii) expensive and time-consuming post-approval clinical studies, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (\"REMS\"), or surveillance, or (iv) limiting the claims that the product label may make, any of which may impede the successful commercialization of Immunic\u2019s product candidates. Following any approval for commercial sale of Immunic\u2019s product candidates, certain changes to the product, such as changes in manufacturing processes and additional labeling claims, as well as new safety information, may require new studies and will be subject to additional FDA notification, or review and approval. Also, marketing approval for any of Immunic\u2019s product candidates may be withdrawn. If Immunic is unable to obtain and maintain marketing approval for its product candidates in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval contains significant limitations, Immunic\u2019s ability to market its product candidates to its full target market will be reduced and its ability to realize the full market potential of its product candidates will be impaired. Furthermore, Immunic may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue and cash flows to continue or complete the development of any of its current or future product candidates.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion when and if to grant approval to Immunic\u2019s product candidates. Even if Immunic believes the data collected from clinical trials of its current product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Immunic\u2019s future clinical trial results also may not be successful.\nIt is impossible to predict the extent to which the clinical trial process may be affected by existing or prospective legislative and regulatory developments. Due to these and other factors, Immunic\u2019s current or future product candidates could take a significantly longer than expected to gain marketing approval, if at all. This could delay or eliminate any potential product revenue by delaying or terminating the potential commercialization of Immunic\u2019s current product candidates.\nPreclinical trials must also be conducted in accordance with FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 legal requirements, regulations or guidelines, including Good Laboratory Practice (\"GLP\"), an international standard meant to harmonize the conduct and quality of non-clinical studies and the archiving and reporting of findings. Preclinical studies, including long-term toxicity studies and carcinogenicity studies in experimental animals, may require further evaluation, which could affect the risk-benefit evaluation of clinical development, or which may even lead the regulatory agencies to delay, prohibit the initiation of or halt clinical trials or delay or deny marketing authorization applications. Failure to adhere to the applicable GLP standards or misconduct during the course of preclinical trials may invalidate the data and require repeating one or more studies or conducting additional testing.\nClinical trials must also be conducted in accordance with legal requirements, regulations or guidelines of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including human subject protection requirements and GCP. Clinical trials are subject to further oversight by these governmental agencies and IRBs at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with supplies of Immunic\u2019s\ncurrent product candidates produced under cGMP and other requirements. Immunic\u2019s clinical trials are conducted at multiple sites, including some sites in countries outside the United States and the European Union, which may subject Immunic to further delays and expenses as a result of increased shipment costs, additional regulatory requirements and the engagement of foreign and non-European Union contract research organizations (\"CROs\"), as well as expose Immunic to risks associated with clinical investigators who are unknown to the FDA or European regulatory authorities, and with different standards of diagnosis, screening and medical care.\nTo date, Immunic has not completed all clinical trials required for the approval of its current product candidates. The commencement and completion of clinical trials for Immunic\u2019s current product candidates may be delayed, suspended or terminated as a result of many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022the delay or refusal of regulators or IRBs to authorize Immunic to commence a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022changes in regulatory requirements, policies and guidelines;\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing as to the design or implementation of Immunic\u2019s clinical trials;\n\u2022failure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022delays in patient enrollment and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials;\n\u2022the inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in trials to ensure adequate statistical power to detect statistically significant treatment effects;\n\u2022lower than anticipated retention rates of patients and volunteers in clinical trials;\n\u2022clinical sites deviating from trial protocols or dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022adding new clinical trial sites;\n\u2022negative or inconclusive results, which may require Immunic to conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials or to abandon projects that Immunic expects to be promising;\n\u2022safety or tolerability concerns, which could cause Immunic to suspend or terminate a trial if it finds that participants are exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022regulators or IRBs requiring that Immunic or its investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022Immunic\u2019s third-party research and manufacturing contractors failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to Immunic in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022third-party researchers becoming debarred or otherwise penalized by FDA or other regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, which could call into question data collected by such researcher and potentially affecting Immunic\u2019s ability rely on some or all of the data in support of our marketing applications;\n\u2022difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data;\n\u2022delays in establishing the appropriate dosage levels;\n\u2022the quality or stability of Immunic\u2019s current product candidates falling below acceptable standards;\n\u2022the inability to produce or obtain sufficient quantities of Immunic\u2019s current product candidates to complete clinical trials; and\n\u2022exceeding budgeted costs due to difficulty in accurately predicting the costs associated with clinical trials.\nPatient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials and is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, the design of the clinical trial, and competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications Immunic is investigating.\nThere are significant requirements imposed on Immunic and on clinical investigators who conduct clinical trials that Immunic sponsors. Although Immunic is responsible for selecting qualified clinical investigators, providing them with the information they need to conduct the clinical trial properly, ensuring proper monitoring of the clinical trial, and ensuring that the clinical trial is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND, Immunic cannot ensure that clinical investigators will maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements at all times. The pharmaceutical industry has experienced cases where clinical investigators have been found to incorrectly record, omit, or even falsify data. Immunic cannot ensure that the clinical investigators in its trials will not make mistakes or otherwise compromise the integrity or validity of data, any of which would have a significant negative effect on Immunic\u2019s ability to obtain marketing approval, Immunic\u2019s business, and Immunic\u2019s financial condition.\nImmunic could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by Immunic, the IRBs or ethics committees of the institutions in which such trial is being conducted, the independent steering committee, the data safety monitoring board (\"DSMB\"), for such trial, or the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Immunic or such authorities may impose a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or Immunic\u2019s clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. Delay or termination of clinical trials of Immunic\u2019s current product candidates will harm their commercial prospects and impair Immunic\u2019s ability to generate revenues from such product candidates. In addition, any delays in completion of Immunic\u2019s clinical trials will increase its costs, slow its development and approval process and jeopardize its ability to commence product sales and generate revenues.\nMoreover, clinical investigators for Immunic\u2019s clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to Immunic from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Immunic is required to report certain financial relationships with clinical investigators to the FDA and, where applicable, take steps to minimize the potential for bias resulting from such financial relationships. The FDA may evaluate the reported information and conclude that a financial relationship between Immunic and a clinical investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. The FDA may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site, and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. The FDA may refuse to accept Immunic\u2019s marketing applications, and other delays or even denial of marketing approval could result.\nPreclinical testing or clinical trials of any development candidate may also show new and unexpected findings regarding safety and tolerability. Such findings may harm the ability to conduct further development of product candidates, delay such development, require additional expensive tests, harm the ability of Immunic to partner these development candidates, or delay or prevent marketing approval by regulatory agencies. Such findings may also harm the ability to compete in the market with other products or to achieve certain pricing thresholds.\nAny of these occurrences could materially adversely affect Immunic\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that could cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of Immunic\u2019s current product candidates. Significant clinical trial delays could also allow Immunic\u2019s competitors to bring products to market before Immunic, shorten any periods during which Immunic may have the exclusive right to commercialize any approved current product candidates, and impair its ability to commercialize any approved current product candidates, which may harm Immunic\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nUse of patient-reported outcomes in Immunic\u2019s clinical trials may delay the development of its product candidates or increase development costs.\nDue to the difficulty of objectively measuring the efficacy of IMU-838, patient-reported outcomes (\"PROs\"), may have an important role in the development and regulatory approval of Immunic\u2019s IMU-838. PROs involve\npatients\u2019 subjective assessments of efficacy, and this subjectivity increases the uncertainty in determining clinical endpoints. Such assessments can be influenced by factors outside of Immunic\u2019s control, and can vary widely from day-to-day for a particular patient, and from patient-to-patient and site-to-site within a clinical trial. Use of PROs may make the outcome of trials more uncertain and may increase Immunic\u2019s costs and time to finish regulatory approval trials.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Because the results of earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate Immunic advances through clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive marketing approval.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of Immunic\u2019s clinical development. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of Immunic\u2019s product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of pharmaceutical companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and Immunic may decide, or regulators may require Immunic, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical testing. Data obtained from trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret Immunic\u2019s data as favorably as Immunic does, which may delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of Immunic\u2019s product candidates. In addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, or approval of a product for desired indications, and flaws or shortcomings in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. Immunic has limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval for Immunic\u2019s desired indications. Further, clinical trials of product candidates often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts. If one of Immunic\u2019s product candidates is found to be unsafe or lack efficacy, Immunic will not be able to obtain marketing approval for such product candidate and Immunic\u2019s business would be harmed. For example, if the results of Immunic\u2019s clinical trials of its product candidates do not achieve pre-specified endpoints, Immunic is unable to provide primary or secondary endpoint measurements deemed acceptable by the FDA or comparable foreign regulators or Immunic is unable to demonstrate an acceptable level of safety relative to the efficacy associated with its proposed indications, the prospects for approval of Immunic\u2019s product candidates would be materially and adversely affected. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and experience than Immunic, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and/or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including differences in trial protocols and design, the size and type of the patient population, adherence to the dosing regimen and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. Immunic does not know whether any clinical trials it may conduct will demonstrate consistent and/or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain marketing approval for Immunic\u2019s product candidates.\nMarketing approval may be substantially delayed or may not be obtained for one or all of Immunic\u2019s product candidates if regulatory authorities require additional or more time-consuming studies to assess the safety and efficacy of its product candidates.\nImmunic may be unable to initiate or complete development of its product candidates on schedule, if at all. The completion of the studies for Immunic\u2019s product candidates will require additional funding. In addition, if regulatory authorities require additional or more time-consuming studies to assess the safety or efficacy of Immunic\u2019s product candidates, Immunic may not have or be able to obtain adequate funding to complete the necessary steps for approval for any or all of its product candidates. Additional delays may result if the FDA, an FDA advisory committee (if one is convened to review Immunic\u2019s NDA) or other regulatory authority indicates that the product candidate should not be approved or there should be restrictions on approval, such as the requirement for a REMS, to ensure safe use of the drug. Delays in marketing approval or rejections of applications for marketing approval in the United States or other markets may result from many factors, including:\n\u2022the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing with the design or implementation of Immunic\u2019s clinical trials;\n\u2022regulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data, non-clinical and preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities questioning or disagreeing with interpretations of data and results;\n\u2022the emergence of new information regarding Immunic\u2019s current or future product candidates or the field of research;\n\u2022unfavorable or inconclusive results of clinical trials and supportive non-clinical studies, including unfavorable results regarding safety or efficacy of Immunic\u2019s product candidates during clinical trials;\n\u2022failure to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u2022inability to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022lack of adequate funding to commence or continue Immunic\u2019s clinical trials due to unforeseen costs or other business decisions;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may find inadequate the manufacturing processes or facilities of the third-party manufacturers with which Immunic contracts for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u2022Immunic may have insufficient funds to pay the significant user fees required by the FDA upon the filing of an NDA; and\n\u2022the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner that would delay marketing approval.\nThe lengthy and unpredictable approval process, as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results, may result in Immunic\u2019s failure to obtain marketing approval to market its product candidates, which would significantly harm Immunic\u2019s business, results of operations and prospects.\nImmunic\u2019s product candidates may cause undesirable adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their marketing approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if obtained.\nUndesirable side effects caused by Immunic\u2019s product candidates could cause Immunic or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If any of Immunic\u2019s current or future product candidates is associated with serious adverse, undesirable or unacceptable side effects, Immunic may need to abandon such candidate\u2019s development or limit development to certain uses or sub-populations in which such side effects are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many drug candidates that initially showed promise in early-stage or clinical testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development. Results of Immunic\u2019s trials could reveal a high and unacceptable prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, Immunic\u2019s trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order Immunic to cease further development of or deny approval of its product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Drug-related side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims.\nIf Immunic\u2019s product candidates receive marketing approval, and Immunic or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such products;\n\u2022Immunic may be required to recall a product or change the way such product is administered to patients;\n\u2022additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing process for the product or any component thereof;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a precaution, \u201cblack box\u201d warning or other warnings or a contraindication;\n\u2022Immunic or its collaborators may be required to implement a REMS or create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effect for distribution to patients;\n\u2022Immunic or its collaborators could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u2022the product may become less competitive; and\n\u2022Immunic\u2019s reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent Immunic from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of any approved product candidates, and could materially adversely affect Immunic\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nImmunic is heavily dependent on the success of its product candidates, which are in the early stages of clinical development. Immunic cannot give any assurance that it will generate data for any of its product candidates sufficient to receive regulatory approval in its planned indications, which will be required before they can be commercialized.\nImmunic has invested substantially all of its efforts and financial resources to identify, acquire and develop its portfolio of product candidates. Its future success is dependent on its ability to successfully further develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize one or more product candidates. Immunic currently generates no revenue from sales of any products, and Immunic may never be able to develop or commercialize a product candidate.\nThe first of Immunic\u2019s product candidates, IMU-838, is being advanced into a Phase 3 program for RRMS, and pivotal trials are expected to start later in 2021. Immunic is not permitted to market or promote any of its product candidates before it receives regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and Immunic may never receive such regulatory approval for any of its product candidates. Immunic cannot be certain that any of its product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, its product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. If Immunic does not receive regulatory approvals for its product candidates, Immunic may not be able to continue its operations.\nImmunic may use its financial and operational resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on programs or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause Immunic has limited financial and operational resources, it may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities in some programs, product candidates or indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Immunic\u2019s resource allocation decisions may cause it to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or more profitable market opportunities. Immunic\u2019s spending on current and future research and development programs and future product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. Immunic may also enter into additional strategic collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize some of its programs and potential product candidates in indications with potentially large commercial markets. If Immunic does not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, it may (i) relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaborations, licensing or other royalty arrangements when it would have been more advantageous to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or (ii) allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a collaborative arrangement.\nImmunic may find it difficult to enroll patients in its clinical trials given the limited number of patients who have the diseases for which its product candidates are being studied. Difficulty in enrolling patients could delay or prevent clinical trials of its product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of Immunic\u2019s product candidates is essential to its success. The timing of Immunic\u2019s clinical trials depends in part on the rate at which Immunic can recruit patients to participate in clinical trials of its product candidates, and Immunic may experience delays in its clinical trials if Immunic encounters difficulties in enrollment.\nThe specific eligibility criteria of Immunic\u2019s planned clinical trials may further limit the available eligible trial participants. Immunic may not be able to identify, recruit, and enroll a sufficient number of patients to initiate or complete its clinical trials in a timely manner because of the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, the availability and efficacy of competing therapies and clinical trials, and the willingness of physicians to participate in its planned clinical trials. If patients are unwilling to participate in Immunic\u2019s clinical trials for any reason, the timeline for conducting trials and obtaining regulatory approval of its product candidates may be delayed.\nIf Immunic experiences delays in the completion of, or experiences termination of, any clinical trials of its product candidates, the commercial prospects of its product candidates could be harmed, and its ability to generate product revenue from product candidates could be delayed or impaired. In addition, any delays in initiating or completing clinical trials would likely increase Immunic\u2019s overall costs, impair product candidate development and impair Immunic\u2019s ability to obtain regulatory approval. Any of these occurrences may harm its business, financial condition, and prospects significantly.\nEven if Immunic receives marketing approval for its product candidates, such approved products will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, any approved product candidates could be subject to labeling and other restrictions, and Immunic may be subject to penalties and legal sanctions if it fails to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with its approved products.\nIf the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of Immunic\u2019s product candidates, the manufacturing processes, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, labeling, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP regulations and GCP for any clinical trials that Immunic conducts post-approval. Any marketing approvals that Immunic receives for its product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor safety and efficacy. The FDA may also require a REMS as a condition of approval of our product candidates, which could include requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with an approved product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing operations or processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, or evidence of acts that raise questions about the integrity of data supporting the product approval, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022restrictions on product distribution or use, or requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022fines, warning letters, untitled letters, or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by Immunic, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;\n\u2022product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay marketing approval, manufacturing or commercialization of Immunic\u2019s product candidates. Immunic cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or other jurisdictions. If Immunic is slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or not able to maintain regulatory compliance, it may lose any marketing approval that may have been obtained and it may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect Immunic\u2019s business.\nThe occurrence of any event described above may limit Immunic\u2019s ability to commercialize any approved product candidates and harm its business, financial condition, and prospects significantly.\nIf Immunic fails to obtain regulatory approval in jurisdictions outside the United States, it will not be able to market its products in those jurisdictions.\nImmunic intends to market any approved product candidates in international markets, or in conjunction with collaborators. Such marketing will require separate regulatory approvals in each market and compliance with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedures vary from country to country and may require testing in addition to what is required for a marketing application in the United States. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval in other countries may be different than in the United States. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. However, the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact Immunic\u2019s ability to obtain approval in another jurisdiction. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval and additional or different risks. Immunic may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize its products in any market, which would significantly harm Immunic\u2019s business, results of operations and prospects.\nAgencies like the FDA and national competition regulators in European countries strictly regulate the promotion of drugs. If Immunic is found to have improperly promoted its current product candidates for uses beyond those that are approved, Immunic may become subject to significant liability.\nRegulatory authorities like the FDA and national competition laws in Europe strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling, known as \u201coff-label\u201d use, nor may it be promoted prior to marketing approval. If Immunic receives marketing approval for its product candidates for Immunic\u2019s proposed indications, physicians may nevertheless prescribe Immunic\u2019s products for their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label if the physicians personally believe in their professional medical judgment it could be used in such manner. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.\nIn addition, the FDA requires that promotional claims not be \u201cfalse or misleading\u201d as such terms are interpreted by the FDA. For example, the FDA requires substantial evidence, which generally consists of two adequate and well-controlled head-to-head clinical trials, for a company to make a claim that its product is superior to another product in terms of safety or effectiveness. Generally, unless Immunic performs clinical trials meeting that standard comparing its product candidates to competing products and these claims are approved for Immunic\u2019s\nproduct labeling, Immunic will not be able promote its current product candidates as superior to competing products.\nIn the United States, regulatory authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. If Immunic is found to have improperly promoted its product, including for an off-label use, it may become subject to significant liability. Numerous drug manufacturers have been the subject of investigations related to off-label promotion resulting in multi-billion dollar settlements, consent decrees, and on-going monitoring under corporate integrity agreements or deferred prosecution agreements. In addition, the FDA could also seek permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is monitored, changed or curtailed.\nImmunic\u2019s current and future relationships with healthcare professionals, investigators, consultants, collaborators, actual customers, potential customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose Immunic to sanctions.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any drug candidates for which Immunic may obtain marketing approval. Immunic\u2019s current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, investigators, consultants, collaborators, actual customers, potential customers and third-party payors may expose Immunic to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act (\"FCA\"), that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which Immunic sells, markets and distributes any drug candidates for which it obtains marketing approval. In addition, Immunic may be subject to physician payment transparency laws and patient privacy and security regulation by the federal government and by the U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which Immunic conducts its business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws that may affect Immunic\u2019s ability to operate include the following:\n\u2022The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and those activities may be subject to scrutiny or penalty if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. A conviction for violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute results in mandatory exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. This statute has been applied to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and those in a position to purchase products or refer others including prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers. In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended the Social Security Act to provide that the U.S. government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act penalties for which are described below.\n\u2022Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties of $11,665 to $23,331 per false claim or statement.\n\u2022The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.\n\u2022The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") imposes criminal and civil penalties for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters.\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing regulations impose obligations on covered entities, including healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\n\u2022The federal Open Payments program, created under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, also known as Section 6002 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d), and its implementing regulations, impose annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for payments and \u201ctransfers of value\u201d provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act expanded the scope of reporting such that companies must also report payments and transfers of value provided to other types of healthcare professionals. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all covered payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties.\n\u2022There are many analogous state and foreign laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\n\u2022The Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal statutes governing healthcare fraud. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.\nEfforts to ensure that Immunic\u2019s future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that Immunic\u2019s business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If Immunic\u2019s operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to it, Immunic may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of Immunic\u2019s operations, which could significantly harm its business. If any of the\nphysicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom Immunic expects to do business, including current and any future collaborators are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, those persons or entities may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also affect Immunic\u2019s business.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as import and export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures, and incur legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business. The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We also may participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions, if non-compliant, could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United States and authorities in the European Union, including applicable import and export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as trade control laws.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws or other legal requirements, including trade control laws. If we are not in compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws or trade control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and incur legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of these anti-corruption laws or trade control laws by U.S. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects.\nThe impact of recent and future healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and healthcare spending on Immunic is currently unknown, and may adversely affect its business model.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system could prevent or delay marketing approval of Immunic\u2019s drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect its ability to profitably sell any drug candidates for which Immunic obtains marketing approval.\nImmunic\u2019s revenue prospects could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the United States and other jurisdictions. Immunic operates in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations, judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery or payment for healthcare products and services could negatively impact Immunic\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. There is significant interest in promoting healthcare reform, as evidenced by the enactment in the United States of the Affordable Care Act. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, revising the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, extending Medicaid rebates to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, imposing mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries who fall into a coverage gap, and subjecting drug manufacturers to payment of an annual fee based on its market share of prior year total sales of branded programs to certain federal healthcare programs.\nThere have been judicial and congressional challenges to the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. In 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld a lower court decision finding the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional and eliminating the individual mandate. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to expedite this appeal, and thus will not issue a decision until early 2021. If a new law is enacted, or if the Affordable Care Act is overturned by the Supreme Court, many if not all of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act may no longer apply to prescription drugs. While we are unable to predict what changes may ultimately be enacted, to the extent that future changes affect how any future products are paid for and reimbursed by government and private payors, our business could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which started in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers. The Biden administration and Congress may announce initiatives intended to result in lower drug prices. We are not in a position to know at this time whether such initiatives will become law or what impact they would have on our business.\nImmunic expects that additional healthcare reform measures and drug pricing regulations that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the revenue that it receives for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent Immunic from being able to generate revenue or commercialize Immunic\u2019s drugs.\nIt is likely that federal and state legislatures within the United States and foreign governments will continue to consider changes to existing healthcare legislation. Immunic cannot predict the reform initiatives that may be adopted in the future or whether initiatives that have been adopted will be repealed or modified. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:\n\u2022the demand for any drug products for which Immunic may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022Immunic\u2019s ability to set a price for its products that Immunic believes is fair;\n\u2022Immunic\u2019s ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product;\n\u2022Immunic\u2019s ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and\n\u2022the level of taxes that Immunic is required to pay.\nIf Immunic fails to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, Immunic could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nImmunic\u2019s research and development activities and the activities of its third-party manufacturers and suppliers involve the controlled storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of its product candidates and other hazardous compounds. Immunic and its manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at facilities of Immunic and its manufacturers pending their use and disposal. Immunic cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of its commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although Immunic believes that the safety procedures utilized by it and its third-party manufacturers and suppliers for handling and disposing of\nthese materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations, Immunic cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination of injury, Immunic may be held liable for any resulting damages, which could exceed its resources or result in government-imposed restrictions on Immunic\u2019s use of specified materials or interruptions of its business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. Immunic cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of its future compliance. Immunic does not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nOther Risks Related to Immunic\u2019s Business\nDue to Immunic\u2019s limited resources and access to capital, it must decide to prioritize development of its current product candidates for certain indications and at certain doses. These decisions may prove to have been wrong and may materially adversely affect Immunic\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nBecause Immunic has limited resources and access to capital to fund its operations, it must decide which dosages and indications to pursue for the clinical development of its current product candidates and the amount of resources to allocate to each. Immunic\u2019s decisions concerning the allocation of research, collaboration, management and financial resources toward dosages or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources away from better opportunities. If Immunic makes incorrect determinations regarding the market potential of its current product candidates or misreads trends in the pharmaceutical industry, Immunic\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nImmunic may not be able to win contracts or grants from governments, academic institutions or non-profits.\nFrom time to time, Immunic may apply for contracts or grants from government agencies, non-profit entities and academic institutions. Such contracts or grants can be highly attractive because they provide capital to fund the ongoing development of Immunic\u2019s product candidates without diluting its stockholders. However, there is often significant competition for these contracts or grants. Entities offering contracts or grants may have requirements to apply for or to otherwise be eligible for certain contracts or grants that Immunic\u2019s competitors may be able to satisfy that Immunic cannot. In addition, such entities may make arbitrary decisions as to whether to offer contracts or make grants, to whom the contracts or grants may or will be awarded and the size of the contracts or grants to each awardee. Even if Immunic is able to satisfy the award requirements, there is no guarantee that Immunic will be a successful awardee. Therefore, Immunic may not be able to win any contracts or grants in a timely manner, if at all.\nIn addition, even if successfully Immunic enters into contracts with or receives grants from government agencies, non-profit entities or academic institutions, it may lose such contracts or grants due to failure to comply with applicable terms, limitations, or government regulations. As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be harmed.\nIf Immunic fails to attract and retain key management and scientific personnel, it may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize its product candidates.\nImmunic\u2019s success as a biotechnology company depends on its continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific and clinical personnel. The loss of the services of any of Immunic\u2019s management could delay or prevent obtaining marketing approval or commercialization of its product candidates.\nImmunic may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific personnel in the future due to the intense competition for a limited number of qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other companies. Immunic\u2019s failure to attract, hire, integrate and retain qualified personnel could impair its ability to achieve its business objectives.\nIf a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against Immunic for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, Immunic could be forced to pay substantial damage awards.\nThe use of any of Immunic\u2019s product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any approved products may expose Immunic to product liability claims. Immunic currently maintains product liability insurance. Immunic intends to monitor the amount of coverage it maintains as the size and design of its clinical trials evolve and adjust the amount of coverage it maintains accordingly. However, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will fully protect Immunic against some or all of the claims to which it might become subject. Immunic might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect it against potential losses. In the event a claim is brought against Immunic, it might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as uncovered damages awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against Immunic. Furthermore, whether or not Immunic is ultimately successful in defending any such claims, Immunic might be required to direct financial and managerial resources to such defense and adverse publicity could result, all of which could harm Immunic\u2019s business.\nImmunic\u2019s employees, independent contractors, investigators, CROs, consultants, collaborators and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nImmunic is exposed to the risk that its employees and other third parties may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by employees and other third parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or violation of FDA regulations and laws that require requiring reporting true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, manufacturing standards, federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, or laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to Immunic\u2019s reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee and other third-party misconduct, and the precautions Immunic takes to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting Immunic from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws. If any such actions are instituted against Immunic, and Immunic is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could have a significant impact on Immunic\u2019s business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of Immunic\u2019s operations, any of which could adversely affect Immunic\u2019s ability to operate. Even if Immunic is ultimately successful in defending any such actions, Immunic could be required to divert financial and managerial resources to such action and adverse publicity could result, all of which could harm Immunic\u2019s business.\nImmunic will need to expand its organization and Immunic may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt its operations.\nAs of February 26, 2021, Immunic had 28 employees. As Immunic\u2019s development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, Immunic may need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial, legal and other resources. Its management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from its day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing its growth. As Immunic advances its product candidates through clinical trials, it will need to expand its development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities. As Immunic\u2019s operations expand, Immunic expects that it will need to manage additional relationships with such third parties, as well as additional collaborators and suppliers.\nImmunic may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of its operations, which may result in weaknesses in its infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees, and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Immunic\u2019s expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If Immunic\u2019s management is unable to effectively manage its growth, its expenses may increase more than expected, its ability to generate and/or grow revenue could be reduced and Immunic may not be able to implement its business strategy. Immunic\u2019s future financial performance and its ability to commercialize product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on its ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nImmunic\u2019s internal computer systems, or those of its development collaborators, third-party CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of Immunic\u2019s product development programs.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our current and any future strategic collaborators, vendors, and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, cybersecurity threats, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. We may experience cyber-attacks on our information technology systems by threat actors of all types (including but not limited to nation states, organized crime, other criminal enterprises, individual actors and/or advanced persistent threat groups). In addition, we may experience intrusions on our physical premises by any of these threat actors. If any such cyber-attack or physical intrusion were to cause interruptions in our operations, such as a material disruption of our development programs or our manufacturing operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information, it would have a material and adverse effect on us. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from one or more ongoing or completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts, significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data and expose us to liability. In addition, any breach of our computer systems or physical premises could result in a loss of data or compromised data integrity across more than one of our programs in different stages of development. Any such breach, loss, or compromise of clinical trial participant personal data may also subject us to civil fines and penalties or claims for damages, either under the General Data Protection Regulation and relevant member state law in the European Union, other foreign laws, and HIPAA, and other relevant state and federal privacy laws in the United States including the California Consumer Privacy Act. On May 13, 2020, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency announced that the FBI is investigating the targeting and compromise of U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research by People\u2019s Republic of China-affiliated cyber actors. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including but not limited to information related to our IMU-838 product candidate, we could incur liability, our competitive and reputational position could be harmed, and the further development and commercialization of our investigational medicines could be delayed. On July 31, 2020 we discovered that an email account at the Company was subject to attempted unauthorized access for a period of up to 24 hours and we have hired an investigator to ascertain what, if any, Company or patient information was impacted. We do not currently believe any confidential or proprietary information was compromised and have taken steps to prevent unauthorized action in the future such as implementing two factor authentication for our email accounts. While we believe that our insurance policies include liability coverage for security breaches, we could be subject to indemnity claims or other damages that exceed our insurance coverage. As a result, the ramifications of a potential security breach could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Immunic\u2019s Product Candidates\nEven if Immunic obtains the required regulatory approvals in the United States and other territories, the commercial success of its product candidates will depend on market awareness and acceptance of its product candidates.\nEven if Immunic obtains marketing approval for its current product candidates or any other product candidates that it may develop or acquire in the future, the products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, key\nopinion leaders, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community. Market acceptance of any approved products depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the timing of market introduction;\n\u2022the efficacy and safety of the product, as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022the clinical indications for which the product is approved and the label approved by regulatory authorities for use with the product, including any precautions, warnings or contraindications that may be required on the label;\n\u2022acceptance by physicians, key opinion leaders and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022the cost, safety and efficacy of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u2022the number and clinical profile of competing products;\n\u2022the growth of drug markets in Immunic\u2019s various indications;\n\u2022relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and\n\u2022the effectiveness of Immunic\u2019s sales and marketing efforts.\nMarket acceptance is critical to Immunic\u2019s ability to generate revenue. Any approved and commercialized product candidate may be accepted in only limited capacities or not at all. If any approved products are not accepted by the market to the extent that Immunic expects, Immunic may not be able to generate revenue and its business would suffer.\nImmunic currently has limited marketing and sales experience. If Immunic is unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell its product candidates, Immunic may be unable to generate any revenue.\nImmunic has never commercialized a product candidate, and Immunic currently has no marketing and sales organization. To the extent Immunic\u2019s product candidates are approved for marketing, if Immunic is unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell its product candidates, Immunic may not be able to effectively market and sell its product candidates or generate product revenue.\nIn addition, Immunic currently does not have marketing, sales or distribution capabilities for its product candidates. In order to commercialize any of Immunic\u2019s products that receive marketing approval, it would have to build marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and Immunic may not be successful in doing so. In the event of successful development of Immunic\u2019s product candidates, if Immunic elects to build a targeted specialty sales force, such an effort would be expensive and time consuming. Any failure or delay in the development of Immunic\u2019s internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of these products. Immunic may choose to collaborate with third parties that have their own sales forces and established distribution systems, in lieu of or to augment any sales force and distribution systems Immunic may create. If Immunic is unable to enter into collaborations with third parties for the commercialization of any approved products on acceptable terms or at all, or if any such collaborator does not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of Immunic\u2019s product or otherwise fails in commercialization efforts, Immunic may not be able to successfully commercialize its product candidates if it receives marketing approval. If Immunic is not successful in commercializing its product candidates, either on its own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, its future revenue will be materially and adversely impacted.\nIf Immunic fails to enter into strategic relationships or collaborations, its business, financial condition, commercialization prospects and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nImmunic\u2019s product development programs and the potential commercialization of its current product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. Therefore, in addition to financing the development of Immunic\u2019s product candidates through additional equity financings or through debt financings, Immunic may decide to enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies for the development and potential commercialization of its product candidates.\nImmunic faces significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. Immunic may also be restricted under existing and future collaboration agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with other potential collaborators. Immunic may not be able to negotiate collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. Any of these contingencies may require Immunic to curtail the development of a particular product, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of its other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of its sales or marketing activities, or increase its expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at its own expense. If Immunic elects to increase its expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on its own, Immunic may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to Immunic on acceptable terms or at all. If Immunic does not have sufficient funds, Immunic will not be able to bring its product candidates to market and generate product revenue. If Immunic does enter into a new collaboration agreement, it could be subject to the following risks, each of which may materially harm Immunic\u2019s business, commercialization prospects and financial condition:\n\u2022Immunic may not be able to control the amount or timing of resources that the collaborator devotes to the product development program;\n\u2022the collaborator may experience financial difficulties and thus not commit sufficient financial resources to the product development program;\n\u2022Immunic may be required to relinquish important rights such as marketing, distribution and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022a collaborator could move forward with a competing product developed either independently or in collaboration with third parties, including Immunic\u2019s competitors; or\n\u2022business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect Immunic\u2019s willingness to complete its obligations under any arrangement.\nCoverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for Immunic\u2019s product candidates, which could make it difficult for Immunic to sell its products profitably.\nThe pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of any of Immunic\u2019s approved products must be sufficient to support its commercial efforts and other development programs, and the availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, including governmental and private insurers, are essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments. Sales of any of Immunic\u2019s approved product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically in other jurisdictions, on the extent to which the costs of any of its approved products will be paid for or reimbursed by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or government payors and private payors. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, or are available only in limited amounts, Immunic may have to subsidize or provide products for free or Immunic may not be able to successfully commercialize its products.\nIn addition, there is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products. In the United States, the principal decisions about coverage and reimbursement for new drugs are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new drug will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow the coverage reimbursement policies established by CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for Immunic\u2019s novel product candidates and what reimbursement codes its product candidates may receive if approved. There also may be delays in obtaining coverage for newly-approved drugs. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval is time-consuming and costly, requiring us to provide payors with scientific, clinical, and cost-\neffectiveness data. Further, eligibility for coverage does not necessarily signify that a drug will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs. Thus, even if we succeed in bringing a product to market, it may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed for any products may be insufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other price-restrictive regulations, and Immunic believes the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of products. In many countries, the prices of products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that Immunic is able to charge for any of its products. Accordingly, the potential revenue and profits from markets outside the United States may be commercially inadequate.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and private payors in the United States and other jurisdictions to limit or reduce healthcare costs may result in restrictions on coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for Immunic\u2019s products. Immunic expects to experience pricing pressures in connection with products due to the increasing trend toward managed healthcare, including the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and prescription drugs in particular, has and is expected to continue to increase in the future. For instance, government and private payors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers are increasingly seeking greater upfront discounts, additional rebates and other concessions to reduce prices for pharmaceutical products. As a result, it may be difficult for any of Immunic\u2019s products to achieve profitability, even if they receive regulatory approval.\nImmunic faces substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before, or more successfully, than Immunic does.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. Immunic faces competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions worldwide with respect to its product candidates that it may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Many of Immunic\u2019s competitors have materially greater name recognition and financial, manufacturing, marketing, research and drug development resources than it does. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in its competitors. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in preclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with Immunic\u2019s competitors.\nIn particular, the field of IBD, including UC, and CD are highly competitive. Immunic\u2019s competitors in the United States and elsewhere include major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and biosimilar manufacturers. Some of these competitors may have more extensive research and development, regulatory compliance, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities than Immunic. Many competitors also have significantly greater financial resources. These companies may succeed in developing products that are more effective or more economical than any of Immunic\u2019s product candidates and may also be more successful than Immunic in manufacturing, developing and registering products. In addition, technological advances or different approaches developed by one or more of Immunic\u2019s competitors may render Immunic\u2019s products obsolete, less effective or uneconomical.\nIf Immunic\u2019s competitors obtain marketing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for their product candidates more rapidly than Immunic does, they could establish a strong market position before Immunic is able to enter the market. Third-party payors, including governmental and private insurers, also may encourage the use of generic products. Failure of any approved product candidates to effectively compete against established treatment options or in the future with new products currently in development would harm Immunic\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe size of the potential market for our product candidates is difficult to estimate and, if any of our assumptions are inaccurate, the actual markets for our product candidates may be smaller than our estimates.\nThe potential market opportunities for our product candidates are difficult to estimate and will depend on a number of factors beyond our control. Our estimates of potential market opportunities are predicated on many assumptions, which may include industry knowledge and publications, third-party research reports, and other surveys. Although we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment on the part of our management, are inherently uncertain, and their reasonableness has not been assessed by an independent source. If any of the assumptions proves to be inaccurate, the actual markets for our product candidates could be smaller than our estimates.\nNegative developments in the field of oral therapies for chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases could damage public perception of our product candidates and negatively affect our business.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of oral therapies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Adverse events in clinical trials of our product candidates or in clinical trials of others developing similar products and the resulting publicity, as well as any other negative developments that may occur in the future, including in connection with competitor therapies, could result in a decrease in demand for our product candidates. These events could also result in the suspension, discontinuation, or clinical hold of or modification to our clinical trials. Our product candidates may not be accepted by the general public or the medical community and potential clinical trial subjects may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials. As a result, we may not be able to continue or may be delayed in conducting our development programs.\nPrice controls may be imposed in foreign markets, which may adversely affect Immunic\u2019s future profitability.\nIn some countries, particularly member states of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, Immunic may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of its product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of Immunic\u2019s products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, Immunic\u2019s business could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Third Parties\nImmunic relies on third-party suppliers and other third parties for production of its product candidates, and Immunic\u2019s dependence on these third parties may impair the advancement of its research and development programs and the development of its product candidates.\nImmunic does not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of its product candidates. Immunic lacks the resources and the capability to manufacture any of its product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. Instead, Immunic relies on, and expects to continue to rely on, third parties for the supply of raw materials and manufacture of drug supplies necessary to conduct its preclinical studies and clinical trials. Immunic\u2019s reliance on third parties for manufacturing exposes Immunic to additional risks. Delays in\nproduction by third parties could delay Immunic\u2019s clinical trials or have an adverse impact on any commercial activities. In addition, Immunic\u2019s dependence on third parties for the manufacture of and formulation of its product candidates subjects it to the risk that such products may have manufacturing defects that Immunic has limited ability to prevent or control. Although Immunic oversees these activities to ensure compliance with its quality standards, budgets and timelines, Immunic has, and will continue to have, less control over the manufacturing of its product candidates than if it was to manufacture its product candidates. Further, the third parties Immunic contracts with could have staffing difficulties, might undergo changes in priorities or may become financially distressed, any of which would adversely affect the manufacturing and production of Immunic\u2019s product candidates. In addition, a third party could be acquired by, or enter into an exclusive arrangement with, one of Immunic\u2019s competitors, which would adversely affect Immunic\u2019s ability to access the formulations it requires for the manufacturing of its product candidates.\nThe facilities used by Immunic\u2019s current contract manufacturers and any future manufacturers to manufacture Immunic\u2019s product candidates must be inspected by the FDA after Immunic submits its NDA. Immunic does not control the manufacturing process of, and is completely dependent on, its contract manufacturers for compliance with the regulatory requirements, known as cGMPs, for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If Immunic\u2019s contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to Immunic\u2019s specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, the FDA may refuse to approve Immunic\u2019s NDA. If the FDA does not approve Immunic\u2019s NDA because of concerns about the manufacture of its product candidates or if significant manufacturing issues arise in the future, Immunic may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact its ability to develop its product candidates, obtain marketing approval of its NDA or to continue to market any approved product candidates. Although Immunic is ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulatory requirements, Immunic does not have day-to-day control over a contract manufacturing organization (\"CMO\"), or other third-party manufacturer\u2019s compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including cGMPs and other laws and regulations, such as those related to environmental health and safety matters. Any failure to achieve and maintain compliance with these laws, regulations and standards could subject Immunic to the risk that Immunic may have to suspend the manufacturing of its product candidates or that obtained approvals could be revoked, which would adversely affect Immunic\u2019s business and reputation. In addition, third-party contractors, such as Immunic\u2019s CMOs, may elect not to continue to work with Immunic due to factors beyond Immunic\u2019s control. They may also refuse to work with Immunic because of their own financial difficulties, business priorities or other reasons, at a time that is costly or otherwise inconvenient for Immunic. If Immunic was unable to find adequate replacement or another acceptable solution in time, Immunic\u2019s clinical trials could be delayed or its commercial activities could be harmed.\nProblems with the quality of the work performed by third parties may lead Immunic to seek to terminate its working relationships and use alternative service providers. However, making this change may be costly and may delay clinical trials. In addition, it may be very challenging, and in some cases impossible, to find replacement service providers that can develop and manufacture Immunic\u2019s drug candidates in an acceptable manner and at an acceptable cost and on a timely basis. The sale of products containing any defects or any delays in the supply of necessary services could adversely affect Immunic\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nGrowth in the costs and expenses of components or raw materials may also adversely affect Immunic\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Supply sources could be interrupted from time to time and, if interrupted, supplies may not be resumed (whether in part or in whole) within a reasonable timeframe and at an acceptable cost or at all.\nImmunic plans to rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials for its product candidates. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, it may cause delays in commencing and completing clinical trials of Immunic\u2019s product candidates or Immunic may be unable to obtain marketing approval for or commercialize its product candidates.\nClinical trials must meet applicable FDA and foreign regulatory requirements. Immunic does not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials for any of its product candidates. Immunic relies and expects to\ncontinue relying on third parties, such as CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct all of its clinical trials of its product candidates; however, Immunic remains responsible for ensuring that each of its clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities require Immunic to comply with IND and human subject protection regulations and cGCPs for conducting, monitoring, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. Immunic\u2019s reliance on third parties does not relieve Immunic of these responsibilities and requirements. Regulatory authorities enforce eGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If Immunic or any of its third-party contractors fail to comply with applicable eGCPs, the clinical data generated in Immunic\u2019s clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require Immunic to perform additional clinical trials before approving its marketing applications. There is no assurance that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of Immunic\u2019s clinical trials comply with eGCPs. Immunic\u2019s failure to comply with these regulations may require Immunic to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the marketing approval process.\nThere are significant requirements imposed on Immunic and on clinical investigators who conduct clinical trials that Immunic sponsors. Although Immunic is responsible for selecting qualified CROs or clinical investigators, providing them with the information they need to conduct the clinical trials properly, ensuring proper monitoring of the clinical trials, and ensuring that the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND, Immunic cannot ensure that the CROs or clinical investigators will maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements at all times. The pharmaceutical industry has experienced cases where clinical investigators have been found to incorrectly record data, omit data, or even falsify data. Immunic cannot ensure that the CROs or clinical investigators in Immunic\u2019s trials will not make mistakes or otherwise compromise the integrity or validity of data, any of which would have a significant negative effect on Immunic\u2019s ability to obtain marketing approval, its business, and its financial condition.\nImmunic or the third parties it relies on may encounter problems in clinical trials that may cause Immunic or the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to delay, suspend or terminate Immunic\u2019s clinical trials at any phase. These problems could include the possibility that Immunic may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in its clinical trials, conduct clinical trials at its preferred sites, enroll a sufficient number of patients for its clinical trials at one or more sites, or begin or successfully complete clinical trials in a timely fashion, if at all. Furthermore, Immunic, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may suspend clinical trials of Immunic\u2019s product candidates at any time if Immunic or they believe the subjects participating in the trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, whether as a result of adverse events occurring in Immunic\u2019s trials or otherwise, or if Immunic or they find deficiencies in the clinical trial process or conduct of the investigation. The FDA or foreign regulatory agencies could also require additional clinical trials before or after granting marketing approval for any products, which would result in increased costs and significant delays in the development and commercialization of such products and could result in the withdrawal of such products from the market even if marketing approval has already been obtained. Immunic\u2019s failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in clinical development could delay or prevent marketing approval of the product candidate. Even if market approval has already been obtained, adverse data from post-approval studies could result in the product being withdrawn from the market. These contingencies would likely have a material adverse effect on Immunic\u2019s business.\nImmunic may be unable to realize the potential benefits of any collaboration.\nEven if Immunic is successful in entering into a collaboration with respect to the development and/or commercialization of one or more product candidates, there is no guarantee that the collaboration will be successful. Collaborations may pose a number of risks, including:\n\u2022collaborators often have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the collaboration, and may not commit sufficient resources to the development, marketing or commercialization of the product or products that are subject to the collaboration;\n\u2022collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022any such collaboration may significantly limit Immunic\u2019s share of potential future profits from the associated program, and may require it to relinquish potentially valuable rights to its current product candidates, potential product candidates or proprietary technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to Immunic;\n\u2022collaborators may cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of Immunic\u2019s product candidates if the collaborators view its product candidates as competitive with their own products or product candidates;\n\u2022disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the course of development, might cause delays or termination of the development or commercialization of product candidates, and might result in legal proceedings, which would be time-consuming, distracting and expensive;\n\u2022collaborators may be impacted by changes in their strategic focus or available funding, or business combinations involving them, which could cause them to divert resources away from the collaboration;\n\u2022collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose Immunic to litigation and potential liability;\n\u2022the collaborations may not result in Immunic achieving revenues to justify such transactions; and\n\u2022collaborations may be terminated, which may require Immunic to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidate.\nAs a result, a collaboration may not result in the successful development or commercialization of Immunic\u2019s product candidates.\nImmunic enters into various contracts in the normal course of its business in which Immunic indemnifies the other party to the contract. In the event Immunic has to perform under these indemnification provisions, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the normal course of business, Immunic periodically enters into academic, commercial, service, collaboration, licensing, consulting and other agreements that contain indemnification provisions. With respect to Immunic\u2019s academic and other research agreements, Immunic typically indemnifies the institution and related parties from losses arising from claims relating to the products, processes or services made, used, sold or performed pursuant to the agreements for which Immunic has secured licenses, and from claims arising from Immunic\u2019s or its sublicensees\u2019 exercise of rights under the agreements.\nShould Immunic\u2019s obligation under an indemnification provision exceed applicable insurance coverage or if Immunic were denied insurance coverage, Immunic\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, if Immunic is relying on a collaborator to indemnify Immunic and the collaborator is denied insurance coverage or the indemnification obligation exceeds the applicable insurance coverage, and if the collaborator does not have other assets available to indemnify Immunic, Immunic\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf Immunic\u2019s contract manufacturers fail to comply with continuing regulations, resulting enforcement action could adversely affect Immunic.\nIf any of Immunic\u2019s contract manufacturers fails to comply with regulatory requirements or if previously unknown problems with products, such manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered, Immunic or the manufacturer could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including restrictions on the products or the manufacturers or manufacturing processes Immunic uses, warning letters, untitled letters, civil or criminal penalties, fines, injunctions, product seizures or detentions, import bans, voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, total or partial suspension of production, and refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products.\nRisks Related to Immunic\u2019s Intellectual Property\nImmunic\u2019s proprietary rights may not adequately protect its technologies and product candidates.\nImmunic\u2019s commercial success will depend in part on its ability to obtain additional patents and protect its existing patent position as well as its ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for its technologies, product candidates, and any future products in the United States and other countries. If Immunic does not adequately protect its intellectual property, competitors may be able to use Immunic\u2019s technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage Immunic may have, which could harm Immunic\u2019s business and ability to achieve profitability. The laws of some foreign countries, in particular China and India, do not protect Immunic\u2019s proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as U.S. laws, and Immunic may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending its proprietary rights in these countries. Immunic will be able to protect its proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that Immunic\u2019s proprietary technologies, product candidates and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nImmunic applies for patents covering both its technologies and product candidates as it deems appropriate. However, Immunic may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or product candidates in a timely fashion, or at all. Immunic\u2019s existing patents and any future patents it obtains may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using its technologies or developing competing products and technologies. Immunic cannot be certain that its patent applications will be approved or that any patents issued will adequately protect Immunic\u2019s intellectual property.\nMoreover, the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are evolving and remain unresolved. As a result, the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, Immunic does not know whether:\n\u2022Immunic or its licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of Immunic\u2019s issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u2022Immunic or its licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022any of the patents that cover Immunic\u2019s product candidates will be eligible to be listed in the FDA\u2019s compendium of \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\u201d sometimes referred to as the FDA\u2019s Orange Book;\n\u2022others will independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of Immunic\u2019s technologies;\n\u2022any of Immunic\u2019s or its licensors\u2019 pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u2022any of Immunic\u2019s or its licensors\u2019 patents will be valid or enforceable;\n\u2022any patents issued to Immunic or its licensors and collaborators will provide Immunic with any competitive advantages, or will be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022Immunic will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022governmental authorities will exercise any of its statutory rights to Immunic\u2019s intellectual property that was developed with government funding; or\n\u2022Immunic\u2019s business may infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others.\nThe actual protection afforded by a patent varies based on products or processes, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, the validity and enforceability of the patents and Immunic\u2019s financial ability to enforce its patents and other intellectual property. Immunic\u2019s ability to maintain and solidify its proprietary rights to its product candidates and future products will depend on its success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. Immunic\u2019s issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to Immunic, may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, and the\nrights granted under any issued patents may not provide Immunic with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Due to the extensive amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of a product candidate, it is possible that, before any of Immunic\u2019s product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.\nImmunic may also rely on trade secrets to protect some of its technology, especially where Immunic does not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain. While Immunic uses reasonable efforts to protect its trade secrets, Immunic\u2019s or any of its collaborators\u2019 employees, consultants, contractors or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose Immunic\u2019s proprietary information to competitors and Immunic may not have adequate remedies in respect of such disclosure. Enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. In addition, foreign courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. If Immunic\u2019s competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods or know-how, Immunic would not be able to assert its rights to trade secrets and Immunic\u2019s business could be harmed.\nImmunic is a party to license agreements under which Immunic licenses intellectual property and receives commercialization rights relating to certain of its product candidates. If Immunic fails to comply with obligations in such agreements or otherwise experience disruptions to its business relationships with its licensors, Immunic could lose license rights that are important to its business; any termination of such agreements would adversely affect Immunic\u2019s business.\nImmunic is a party to license agreements that give Immunic various commercialization rights, the loss of which (whether due to Immunic\u2019s actions or those of the respective counterparties) may adversely affect Immunic\u2019s business. For instance, in November 2018, Immunic and Daiichi Sankyo entered into a license and option agreement that grants Immunic an exclusive global option to license IMU-856 and related molecules. In January 2020, Immunic exercised this option and acquired the rights to commercialization of IMU-856 in all countries including the U.S., Europe and Japan.\nThe loss of (i) the licenses granted to Immunic under its agreements with Daiichi Sankyo and other licensors, or (ii) the rights provided under such agreements, would prevent Immunic from developing, manufacturing or marketing products covered by the license or subject to supply commitments, and could materially harm Immunic\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nImmunic may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and Immunic\u2019s intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. Consequently, Immunic may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing Immunic\u2019s technologies in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using Immunic\u2019s technologies in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use Immunic\u2019s technologies in jurisdictions where Immunic has not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where Immunic has patent protection but enforcement rights are weaker than in the United States. These products may compete with Immunic\u2019s product candidates in jurisdictions where Immunic does not have any issued patents and Immunic\u2019s patent claims or other intellectual rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent such competition.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights, which could make it difficult for Immunic to stop the infringement of its patents\ngenerally. Proceedings to enforce Immunic\u2019s patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert Immunic\u2019s efforts and attention from other aspects of its business, could put its patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and its patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against Immunic. Immunic may not prevail in any lawsuits that it initiates and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, Immunic\u2019s efforts to enforce its intellectual property rights throughout the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that it develops or licenses.\nIf Immunic does not obtain patent term extension in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation, it may be unable to extend the term of marketing exclusivity for its product candidates and its business may be materially harmed.\nDepending on the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of Immunic\u2019s product candidates, one of the U.S. patents covering each of such approved product or the use thereof may be eligible for up to five years of patent term restoration under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows extension of a maximum of one patent per FDA-approved product. Patent term extension or special protection certificates also may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of Immunic\u2019s product candidates. Nevertheless, Immunic may not be granted patent term extension either in the United States or in any foreign country because of, among other things, failing to apply prior to applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the term of extension afforded as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension could be less than Immunic requests.\nIf Immunic is unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration, or the term of any such extension is less than Immunic or its collaborators request, the period during which Immunic will have the right to exclusively market its product will be shortened and Immunic\u2019s competitors may obtain approval of competing products following Immunic\u2019s patent expiration, and Immunic\u2019s revenue could be materially reduced.\nImmunic may not identify relevant patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a patent, which may adversely affect Immunic\u2019s ability to develop and market its product candidates.\nImmunic cannot guarantee that any of its patent searches or analyses (including, but not limited to, the identification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents) are complete or thorough, nor can Immunic be certain that Immunic has identified each and every patent and pending application in the United States and other jurisdictions that is relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of its product candidates in any jurisdiction.\nThe scope of a patent claim is determined by legal interpretation, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent\u2019s prosecution history. Immunic\u2019s interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact its ability to market its product candidates. Immunic may incorrectly determine that its product candidates are not covered by a third-party patent.\nMany patents may cover a marketed product, including but not limited to patents covering the composition, methods of use, formulations, production processes and purification processes of or for the product. The identification of all patents and their expiration dates relevant to the production and sale of a therapeutic product is extraordinarily complex and requires sophisticated legal knowledge in the relevant jurisdiction. It may be impossible to identify all patents in all jurisdictions relevant to a marketed product. Immunic\u2019s determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or other jurisdictions that it considers relevant may be incorrect, which may negatively impact its ability to develop and market its product candidates.\nObtaining and maintaining Immunic\u2019s patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and Immunic\u2019s patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\"), and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent prosecution process. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on any issued patent and/or pending patent applications are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of a patent or patent application. Immunic employs an outside firm and relies on its outside counsel to pay these fees. While an inadvertent lapse may sometimes be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are many situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If Immunic fails to maintain the patents and patent applications covering its product candidates, Immunic\u2019s competitors might be able to enter the market sooner, which would have a material adverse effect on Immunic\u2019s business.\nThe patent protection for Immunic\u2019s product candidates may expire before Immunic is able to maximize their commercial value, which may subject Immunic to increased competition and reduce or eliminate its opportunity to generate product revenue.\nThe patents for Immunic\u2019s product candidates have varying expiration dates and, if these patents expire, Immunic may be subject to increased competition and Immunic may not be able to recover its development costs or market any of its approved products profitably. In some of the larger potential markets, such as the United States and Europe, patent term extension or restoration may be available to compensate for time taken during aspects of the product\u2019s development and regulatory review. However, Immunic cannot be certain that such an extension will be granted, or if granted, what the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded during any extension period will be. In addition, even though some regulatory authorities may provide some other exclusivity for a product under their own laws and regulations, Immunic may not be able to qualify the product or obtain exclusivity. If Immunic is unable to obtain patent term extension, restoration or some other exclusivity, Immunic could be subject to increased competition and its opportunity to establish or maintain product revenue could be substantially reduced or eliminated. Furthermore, Immunic may not have sufficient time to recover its development costs prior to the expiration of its U.S. and foreign patents.\nImmunic may become involved in lawsuits to protect its patents or other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe Immunic\u2019s patents or other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, Immunic may be required to file infringement claims, directly or through its licensors, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of Immunic\u2019s licensor is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that Immunic\u2019s patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of the patents Immunic licenses at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put Immunic\u2019s licensors\u2019 patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to patents of Immunic\u2019s licensors and patent applications or those of Immunic\u2019s current or future collaborators. An unfavorable outcome could require Immunic to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Immunic\u2019s business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer Immunic a license on terms that are acceptable to Immunic. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of Immunic\u2019s management and other employees. Immunic may not be able to prevent, alone or with its collaborators, misappropriation of its proprietary rights, particularly in countries whose laws do not grant the same protections to intellectual property as fully as the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of Immunic\u2019s confidential and proprietary information could be compromised by\ndisclosure. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of Immunic\u2019s common stock.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation may adversely affect Immunic\u2019s business and could prevent Immunic from developing or commercializing its product candidates.\nImmunic\u2019s commercial success depends in part on avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, ex-parte review, inter party review and post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO and foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications exist in the fields in which Immunic is developing and may develop its product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that Immunic\u2019s product candidates may be subject to third-party claims of patent infringement. Third-party claims that Immunic infringes on their products or technology could present a number of issues, including:\n\u2022infringement and other intellectual property claims, whether with or without merit, can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and can divert management\u2019s attention from Immunic\u2019s core business;\n\u2022the risk of substantial court-imposed damages for past infringement;\n\u2022a court prohibiting Immunic from selling or licensing its product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to Immunic, which it would not be required to do;\n\u2022even if a license is available from the patent holder, Immunic may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to Immunic\u2019s patents; and\n\u2022Immunic may need to redesign its processes to avoid further infringement, which may not be possible or could require expenditure of substantial funds and time.\nThird parties may assert that Immunic is employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of Immunic\u2019s product candidates, that Immunic failed to identify. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until issued as patents. Except for the preceding exceptions, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are generally published only after a waiting period of approximately 18 months after the earliest filing. Therefore, patent applications covering Immunic\u2019s product candidates may have been filed by others without the knowledge of Immunic or its licensors. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover Immunic\u2019s product candidates or the use or manufacture of its product candidates. Immunic may also face misappropriation claims if a third party believes that Immunic inappropriately obtained and used its trade secrets. If the third-party prevails on such claims, Immunic may be prevented from further using such trade secrets, limiting its ability to develop its product candidates, and may be required to pay damages.\nIf a court of competent jurisdiction held that any third-party patents cover aspects of Immunic\u2019s materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment, the holders of any such patents would be able to block Immunic\u2019s ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate until such patent expired or unless Immunic obtains a license. A license may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if Immunic was able to obtain a license, the rights could be nonexclusive, which could result in Immunic\u2019s competitors having access to its licensed intellectual property.\nUltimately, Immunic could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of its business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, Immunic is unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, during the course of any patent or other intellectual property litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, rulings on motions, and other interim proceedings in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the\nperceived value of Immunic\u2019s product candidates, programs, or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of Immunic\u2019s common stock may decline.\nParties making claims against Immunic may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block Immunic\u2019s ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of its product candidates. Defending against claims of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets could be costly and time-consuming, regardless of the outcome. Thus, even if Immunic was to ultimately prevail, or to settle at an early stage, such litigation could burden Immunic with substantial unanticipated costs. In addition, litigation or threatened litigation could result in significant demands on the time and attention of Immunic\u2019s management team, distracting them from the pursuit of other company business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against Immunic, Immunic may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign its infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial expenditure of time and money. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on Immunic\u2019s ability to raise the funds necessary to continue its clinical trials, continue its research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into collaborative arrangements that would help Immunic bring its product candidates to market.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing Immunic\u2019s ability to protect its product candidates.\nAs is the case with other pharmaceutical companies, Immunic\u2019s success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly on obtaining and enforcing patents and patent rights. Obtaining and enforcing patents and patent rights in the biotechnology industry involves both technological and legal complexity, and therefore, is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Further, several recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have either narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to Immunic\u2019s ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents and patent rights, once obtained.\nFor Immunic\u2019s U.S. patent applications containing a claim not entitled to priority before March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law. In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (\"the AIA\"), was signed into law. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and reviewed after issuance, and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the AIA and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the AIA. It is not clear what other, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of Immunic\u2019s business. Moreover, the AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of patent rights, all of which could have a material adverse effect on Immunic\u2019s business and financial condition.\nAn important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-inventor-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but Immunic or Immunic\u2019s licensor could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of Immunic\u2019s even if Immunic or its licensor had made the invention before the third party. This will require Immunic to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Furthermore, Immunic\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patent rights depends on whether the differences between the licensor\u2019s or Immunic\u2019s technology and the prior art allow Immunic\u2019s technology to be patentable over the prior art. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, Immunic cannot be certain that a licensor or it was the first to either (i) file any patent application related to Immunic\u2019s product candidates or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in Immunic\u2019s patents or patent applications.\nAmong other changes, the AIA limits where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and provides opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because the evidentiary standard to invalidate a patent claim in USPTO proceedings is lower than for a procedure in U.S. federal court, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate patent rights that would not have been invalidated in federal court.\nDepending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken Immunic\u2019s ability to obtain new patents or to enforce its existing patents and patents that Immunic might obtain in the future.\nBecause of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, Immunic may not be in a position to enforce its intellectual property rights against third parties.\nBecause of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, Immunic may conclude that even if a third party is infringing the patents of Immunic\u2019s licensors or Immunic or other intellectual property rights, the risk-adjusted cost of bringing and enforcing such a claim or action may be too high or not in the best interest of Immunic or its stockholders. In such cases, Immunic may decide that the more prudent course of action is to simply monitor the situation or initiate or seek some other non-litigious action or solution.\nIntellectual property rights do not protect against all potential threats to Immunic\u2019s competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by Immunic\u2019s intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect Immunic\u2019s business, or permit Immunic to maintain its competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022Others may be able to make products that are similar to Immunic\u2019s product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that Immunic licenses from others or may license or own in the future.\n\u2022Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or otherwise circumvent any of Immunic\u2019s technologies without infringing its intellectual property rights.\n\u2022Any of Immunic\u2019s collaborators might not have been the first to conceive and reduce to practice the inventions covered by the patents or patent applications that Immunic licenses or will, in the future, own or license.\n\u2022Any of Immunic\u2019s collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of the patents or patent applications that Immunic licenses or will, in the future, license.\n\u2022Issued patents that have been licensed to Immunic may not provide Immunic with any competitive advantage, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by Immunic\u2019s competitors.\n\u2022Immunic\u2019s competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where Immunic does not have license rights, or in countries where research and development safe harbor laws exist, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in Immunic\u2019s major commercial markets.\n\u2022Ownership of patents or patent applications licensed to Immunic may be challenged by third parties.\n\u2022The patents of third parties or pending or future applications of third parties, if issued, may have an adverse effect on Immunic\u2019s business.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and protect other proprietary information.\nTrade secrets and/or confidential know-how can be difficult to maintain as confidential. To protect this type of information against disclosure or appropriation by competitors, Immunic requires its employees, consultants, contractors and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with Immunic. However, current or former employees, consultants, contractors and advisers may unintentionally or willfully disclose Immunic\u2019s confidential\ninformation to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party obtained illegally and is using trade secrets and/or confidential know-how is expensive, time-consuming and unpredictable. The enforceability of confidentiality agreements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nFailure to obtain or maintain trade secrets and/or trade protection of confidential know-how could adversely affect Immunic\u2019s competitive position. Moreover, Immunic\u2019s competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and may even apply for patent protection in respect of the same. If successful in obtaining such patent protection, Immunic\u2019s competitors could limit Immunic\u2019s use of its trade secrets and/or confidential know-how.\nImmunic may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development or commercialization of Immunic\u2019s product candidates. It may be necessary for Immunic to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize its product candidates, in which case Immunic would be required to obtain a license from such third parties. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could materially harm Immunic\u2019s business.\nImmunic may be subject to claims that its employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nImmunic has received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, Immunic employs individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. Immunic may be subject to claims that Immunic or its employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or the former employers of Immunic\u2019s employees, consultants or independent contractors.\nFurther, Immunic may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising from, among other things, consultants or third-parties who are involved in developing Immunic\u2019s product candidates. Immunic may also be subject to claims that former employees, consultants, independent contractors, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in Immunic\u2019s patents or other intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging Immunic\u2019s right to and use of confidential and proprietary information. If Immunic fails in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, Immunic may lose its rights to certain intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on Immunic\u2019s business.\nEven if Immunic is successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to Immunic\u2019s management and employees.\nImmunic may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of its patents and other intellectual property.\nImmunic may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in its patents and other intellectual property. Immunic may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing Immunic\u2019s product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If Immunic fails in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, Immunic may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on Immunic\u2019s business. Even if Immunic is successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nImmunic\u2019s reliance on third parties requires Immunic to share its trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that Immunic\u2019s trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause Immunic relies on third parties to assist with research and development and to manufacture its product candidates, Immunic must, at times, share trade secrets with them. Immunic seeks to protect its proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with its advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use, disclose or publish Immunic\u2019s confidential information, including its trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets will become known to Immunic\u2019s competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that Immunic\u2019s proprietary position is based, in part, on its know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of Immunic\u2019s trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair Immunic\u2019s competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on its business.\nIn the future Immunic may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require it to share trade secrets under the terms of its research and development or similar agreements. Despite Immunic\u2019s efforts to protect its trade secrets, Immunic\u2019s competitors may discover its trade secrets, either through breach of Immunic\u2019s agreements with third parties, independent development or publication of information by any of Immunic\u2019s third-party collaborators. A competitor\u2019s discovery of Immunic\u2019s trade secrets would impair Immunic\u2019s competitive position and have an adverse impact on its business.\nIf Immunic\u2019s trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then Immunic may not be able to build name recognition in its markets of interest and its business may be adversely affected.\nIf Immunic\u2019s trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then Immunic may not be able to build name recognition in its markets of interest and its business may be adversely affected. Immunic\u2019s unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. Immunic may not be able to protect its rights to these trademarks and trade names, which Immunic needs to build name recognition among potential collaborators or customers in its markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to Immunic\u2019s, thereby impeding Immunic\u2019s ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of Immunic\u2019s unregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if Immunic is unable to successfully register its trademarks and trade names and establish name recognition based on its trademarks and trade names, then Immunic may not be able to compete effectively and its business may be adversely affected. Immunic\u2019s efforts to enforce or protect its proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact Immunic\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company\nImmunic incurs significant costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nImmunic incurs significant legal, accounting and other expenses that it would not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. Immunic also incurs costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), as well as new rules implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market (\"Nasdaq\"). These rules and regulations increase the company\u2019s legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-\nconsuming and costly. Not all members of Immunic\u2019s management have previously managed and operated a public company. These executive officers and other personnel will need to devote substantial time to gaining expertise regarding operations as a public company and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for the company to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for Immunic to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on its board of directors or as executive officers of the company, which may adversely affect investor confidence in Immunic and could cause Immunic\u2019s business or stock price to suffer.\nEffective December 31, 2019, Immunic is no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d no longer apply, which will increase Immunic\u2019s costs as a public company and increase the demands on management.\nEffective December 31, 2019, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of its initial public offering, Immunic is no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. As a result, Immunic will incur significant additional expenses in complying with certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules implemented by the SEC. Moreover, if Immunic or its independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in Immunic\u2019s internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of Immunic\u2019s stock could decline, and Immunic could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. Furthermore, investor perceptions of Immunic may suffer if, in the future, material weaknesses are found, and this could cause a decline in the market price of Immunic\u2019s stock. Any failure of Immunic\u2019s internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s stated operating results and harm its reputation. If Immunic is unable to implement these changes effectively or efficiently, it could harm Immunic\u2019s operations, financial reporting or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on internal control from its independent registered public accounting firm.\nIn addition, Immunic is no longer eligible for reduced disclosure requirements and exemptions requirements applicable to emerging growth companies regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory say-on-pay votes on executive compensation and as such, Immunic will hold a say-on-pay vote and a say-on-frequency vote at its 2021 annual meeting of stockholders. Immunic expects that the increased disclosure requirements will require additional attention from management and will result in increased costs to the company, which could include higher legal fees, accounting fees and fees associated with investor relations activities, among others.\nRisks Related to Immunic\u2019s Common Stock\nThe market price of Immunic\u2019s common stock is volatile.\nThe market price of Immunic\u2019s common stock can be subject to significant fluctuations. Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of Immunic\u2019s common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022reports on or the perception of clinical progress, or the lack thereof;\n\u2022the ability of Immunic to obtain regulatory approvals for its product candidates, and delays or failures to obtain such approvals;\n\u2022failure of any of Immunic\u2019s approved product candidates to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022failure to maintain its existing third-party license and supply agreements;\n\u2022failure by Immunic or its licensors to prosecute, maintain, or enforce its intellectual property rights;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations applicable to its product candidates;\n\u2022any inability to obtain adequate supply of its product candidates or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022adverse regulatory authority decisions;\n\u2022introduction of new products, services, or technologies by its competitors;\n\u2022failure to meet or exceed financial and development projections that Immunic may provide to the public;\n\u2022failure to meet or exceed the financial and development projections of the investment community;\n\u2022the perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures, or capital commitments by Immunic or its competitors;\n\u2022disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and its ability to obtain patent protection for its technologies;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about its business, or if they issue adverse or misleading opinions regarding its business and stock;\n\u2022changes in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022general market or macroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022sales of common stock by the company or its stockholders in the future;\n\u2022trading volume of its common stock;\n\u2022announcements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, clinical progress or the lack thereof, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022adverse publicity relating to the markets in which Immunic operates, including with respect to other products and product candidates in such markets;\n\u2022the introduction of technological innovations or new therapies that compete with product candidates of Immunic;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems; and\n\u2022period-to-period fluctuations in Immunic\u2019s financial results.\nMoreover, stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of Immunic\u2019s common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm Immunic\u2019s profitability and reputation.\nAdditionally, a decrease in the stock price of Immunic may cause the company\u2019s common stock to no longer satisfy the continued listing standards of The Nasdaq Global Select Market. If the company is not able to maintain the requirements for listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, it could be delisted, which could have a materially adverse effect on its ability to raise additional funds as well as the price and liquidity of its common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in Immunic\u2019s organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for the company that stockholders might consider favorable.\nImmunic\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \"Certificate of Incorporation\"), and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \"Bylaws\"), contain provisions that may delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control of the company. Immunic\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022authorize Immunic\u2019s board of directors to issue without further action by the stockholders, up to 20,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022require that any action to be taken by Immunic\u2019s stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of Immunic\u2019s stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to Immunic\u2019s board of directors;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on Immunic\u2019s board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u2022establish that Immunic\u2019s board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving staggered terms.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, Immunic is subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that Immunic\u2019s stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of Immunic, including actions that its stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of its common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause Immunic to take other corporate actions they desire.\nImmunic may experience adverse consequences because of required indemnification of officers and directors.\nProvisions of Immunic\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that it will indemnify any director and officer as to liabilities incurred in their capacity as a director or officer and on those terms and conditions set forth therein to the fullest extent of Delaware law. Further, Immunic may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any such persons whether or not Immunic would have the power to indemnify such person against the liability insured against. The foregoing could result in substantial expenditures by Immunic and prevent any recovery from its officers, directors, agents and employees for losses incurred by the company as a result of their actions.\nImmunic does not anticipate that it will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe current expectation is that Immunic will retain any future earnings to fund the development and growth of\nits business. As a result, any capital appreciation of the common stock of the company will be stockholders\u2019 sole source of any gain for the foreseeable future.\nThe ownership of Immunic\u2019s common stock is highly concentrated, which may prevent stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that could cause Immunic\u2019s stock price to decline.\nExecutive officers and directors of Immunic and their affiliates and entities that are related to such officers and directors beneficially own or control approximately 31% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company. Accordingly, these executive officers, directors and their affiliates, acting as a group, have substantial influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of Immunic\u2019s assets or any other significant corporate transactions. These stockholders may also delay or prevent a change of control of Immunic, even if such a change of control would benefit the other stockholders of the company. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of Immunic\u2019s common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise, and may adversely affect the liquidity of Immunic\u2019s common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf Immunic fails to maintain proper and effective internal controls, its ability to produce accurate financial\nstatements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nImmunic is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Nasdaq rules and regulations. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that Immunic maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting is necessary for Immunic to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. Immunic must perform system and process evaluation and testing of its internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for each year, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"Section 404\"). This requires significant management efforts and requires Immunic to incur substantial professional fees and internal costs to expand its accounting and finance functions. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause the company to fail to meet its reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by Immunic, as and when required, conducted in connection with Section 404, or any subsequent testing by the company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, as and when required, may reveal deficiencies in the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to its financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Furthermore, Immunic cannot be certain that its efforts will be sufficient to remediate or prevent future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies from occurring.\nIf Immunic is not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if it is unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, it may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of Immunic\u2019s common stock could decline and it could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities.\nImmunic\u2019s business and stock price could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of its securities.\nStockholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on Immunic\u2019s board of directors and management. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict with Immunic\u2019s strategic direction or seek changes in the composition of its board of directors could have an adverse effect on Immunic\u2019s operating results and financial condition. A proxy contest would require Immunic to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by Immunic\u2019s board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of Immunic\u2019s business strategy. Any perceived uncertainties as to Immunic\u2019s future direction and control, its ability to execute on its strategy, or changes to the composition of its board of directors or management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of its business or instability which may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, make it more difficult to pursue strategic initiatives, or limit its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect its business and operating results. If individuals are ultimately elected to Immunic\u2019s board of directors with a specific agenda, Immunic\u2019s ability to effectively implement its business strategy and create additional value for its stockholders may adversely effected. Immunic may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to its board of directors and management and would require it to incur significant additional costs. In addition, actions such as those described above could cause significant negative or other fluctuations in Immunic\u2019s stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of Immunic\u2019s business.\nAn active trading market for Immunic\u2019s common stock may not be sustained and its stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock for a profit, if at all.\nAn active trading market for Immunic\u2019s shares of common stock may not be sustained. If an active market for Immunic\u2019s common stock is not sustained, it may be difficult for stockholders to sell their shares at an attractive price or at all.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause Immunic\u2019s stock price to decline.\nIf existing stockholders of Immunic sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of the company\u2019s common stock in the public market after legal restrictions on resale lapse, the trading price of the common stock of the company could decline.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about Immunic, its business or its market, its stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for Immunic\u2019s common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about it and its business. Equity research analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of Immunic\u2019s common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of its common stock. In the event it does have equity research analyst coverage, Immunic will not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of Immunic\u2019s common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade its stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of Immunic or fails to publish reports on it regularly, demand for its common stock could decrease, which in turn could cause its stock price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 14615, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "IMUX"}
