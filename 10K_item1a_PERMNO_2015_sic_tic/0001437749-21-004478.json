{"cik": "906553", "company": "BOYD GAMING CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this report on Form 10-K, the following Risk Factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our securities, including our common stock and senior notes, could decline significantly, and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nThis report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThe novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic and the public response to it has had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and results.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic and related measures to prevent its spread, all of our gaming facilities were closed in mid-March 2020 in response to orders from public officials and government regulations. As of December 31, 2020, 24 of our 28 casino properties are re-opened and operating, while two properties in Las Vegas remain closed as a result of business demand and cost containment measures and two properties in the Midwest & South were temporarily closed due to public official orders and subsequently re-opened in January 2021. We cannot predict when we will re-open our remaining properties, or whether some or all of our properties may be required to temporarily close in the future. Our business, operations, financial condition and results have been, and could again be, negatively affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur properties are subject to various health and safety measures instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including substantial limitations on occupancy. We cannot predict how long current health and safety protocols will be necessary. Decisions by public officials in this regard will depend on many factors beyond our control and that remain uncertain in light of on-going developments related to the pandemic, including development of preventative or treatment protocols.\nWe have been required to reduce the offering of certain amenities (because such amenities must remain closed) and otherwise limit the availability of certain offerings, such as deactivating a substantial number of gaming devices to maintain social distancing and limiting restaurant seating, as well as substantially limiting the number of customers we are permitted to admit at any time. Such measures necessarily impact business volume and may impact customer behavior and business demand, and the duration of such potential impact is unknown at this time. Our business, operations, financial condition and results may be materially, negatively affected to the extent demand for our casinos and customer preference and behavior is altered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and public response. We cannot predict the extent to which the global pandemic and public response may negatively affect business operating results in the future.\nIn addition, to the extent that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and public response on the economy negatively affects discretionary spending patterns, we may be negatively affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have lingering impacts with respect to unemployment and discretionary spending. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have laid-off a substantial number of our employees, as have many other businesses in the gaming and hospitality industries. Similar actions throughout the U.S. economy have significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and may potentially cause regional, national or global recessions. Significant increases in unemployment (and the lingering impacts of temporary unemployment after certain furloughed workers return to work) may have a negative impact on demand for gaming facilities, and these impacts could exist for an extensive period of time. Demand for gaming facilities may further be negatively impacted by the adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate and declines in income levels and loss of personal wealth.\nThe foregoing may also negatively affect our workforce, suppliers, contractors and other partners. We cannot predict the extent to which the above factors will cause our costs to increase, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, logistics constraints or business failures or inability to provide services or products for our partners.\nThe current and future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and public response is expected to continue to impact our results, operations, outlooks, plans, goals, growth, reputation, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy.\nConsumer demand for entertainment and other amenities at casino hotel properties, such as ours, are particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions, effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy, including any future housing, employment and credit crisis, the impact of high energy and food costs, the increased cost of travel, the potential for bank failures, an ongoing pandemic, decreased disposable consumer income and wealth, or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer, thus imposing practical limits on pricing and negatively impacting our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn 2008, we experienced a profound reduction in consumer demand as a result of the economic recession in the U.S. economy, and we are now experiencing the impacts of COVID-19, which are significantly impacting customer visitations and business revenue. Consumer spending habits changed significantly due to the recession in 2008, and we expect that consumer behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may be similarly altered for an extended period of time. We cannot say when, if ever, or to what extent, customer behavior in our various markets will fully-revert to prior trends. As such, our business may be adversely affected. Since our business model relies on consumer expenditures on entertainment, luxury and other discretionary items, an ongoing economic downturn, including the impact of COVID-19, may be expected to further adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIntense competition exists in the gaming industry, and we expect competition to continue to intensify.\nThe gaming industry is highly competitive for both customers and employees, including those at the management level. We compete with numerous casinos and hotel casinos of varying quality and size in market areas where our properties are located. We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation destinations, and with various other casino and other entertainment businesses, including online gaming websites, and could compete with any new forms of gaming that may be legalized in the future. The casino entertainment business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably in their size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, level of amenities, management talent and geographic diversity. In most markets, we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas. In some markets, we face competition from nearby markets in addition to direct competition within our market areas.\nWith fewer other new markets opening for development, competition in existing markets has intensified in recent years. We and our competitors have invested in expanding existing facilities, developing new facilities, and acquiring established facilities in existing markets. This expansion of existing casino entertainment properties, the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we compete, and this intense competition can be expected to continue. Additionally, competition may intensify if our competitors commit additional resources to aggressive pricing and promotional activities in order to attract customers.\nAlso, our business may be adversely impacted by the additional gaming and room capacity in states where we operate or intend to operate. Several states are also considering enabling the development and operation of casinos or casino-like operations in their jurisdictions.\nThe possible future expansion of gaming in Wisconsin or the possible expansion of gaming in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, if approved, could impact the operating results of the Diamond Jo Dubuque. Further, Kansas Star could, in the future, face competition from the Wichita Greyhound Park, located approximately 30 miles away in Park City, Kansas.\nWe also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on Native American tribal lands. Expansion of Native American gaming in areas located near our properties, or in areas in or near those from which we draw our customers, could have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, land located in Park City, Kansas (in the Wichita metro area) was recently taken into trust by the U.S. Government for the benefit of the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma and gaming operations have commenced at that location, which may negatively impact the business operations of the Kansas Star Casino.\nIn addition, we also compete to some extent with other forms of gaming on both a local and national level, including state-sponsored lotteries, charitable gaming, video gaming terminals at bars, restaurants, taverns and truck stops, on-and off-track wagering, and other forms of entertainment, including motion pictures, sporting events and other recreational activities. It is possible that these secondary competitors could reduce the number of visitors to our facilities or the amount they are willing to wager, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue or maintain our profitability and cash flows.\nIf our competitors operate more successfully than we do, if they attract customers away from us as a result of aggressive pricing and promotion, if they are more successful than us in attracting and retaining employees, if their properties are enhanced or expanded, if they operate in jurisdictions that give them operating advantages due to differences or changes in gaming regulations or taxes, or if additional hotels and casinos are established in and around the locations in which we conduct business, we may lose market share or the ability to attract or retain employees. In particular, the expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, increased competition may require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our properties, including updating slot machines to reflect changing technology, refurbishing public service areas periodically, replacing obsolete equipment on an ongoing basis and making other expenditures to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities. Because we are highly leveraged, after satisfying our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake these expenditures or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund such expenditures. If we are unable to make such expenditures, our competitive position could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets.\nIn accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets, we test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or if a triggering event occurs. We perform our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1. Impairment charges of $3.6 million were recorded as a result of our annual 2020 impairment test and $171.1 million were recorded as a result of our first quarter impairment review. No impairment charges were recorded as a result of the 2019 and 2018 tests.\nIf our estimates of projected cash flows related to our assets are not achieved, we may be subject to future impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of our information technology systems, protect our internal information, or comply with applicable privacy and data security regulations could adversely affect us.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to process customer transactions, manage customer data, manage employee data and communicate with third-party vendors and other third parties, and we may also access the internet to use our computer systems. Our operations require that we collect and store customer data, including credit card numbers and other personal information, for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. We also collect and store personal information about our employees. Breaches of our security measures or information technology systems or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive personal information or confidential data about us, or our customers, or our employees including the potential loss or disclosure of such information as a result of hacking or other cyber-attack, computer virus, fraudulent use by customers, employees or employees of third party vendors, trickery or other forms of deception or unauthorized use, or due to system failure, could expose us, our customers, our employees or other individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our casino or brand names and reputations or otherwise harm our business. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of customer information, such as payment card, employee information and other confidential or proprietary information. Our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly, however they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats. The cost and operational consequences of implementing further data security measures could be significant.\nAdditionally, the collection of customer and employee personal information imposes various privacy compliance related obligations on our business and increases the risks associated with a breach or failure of the integrity of our information technology systems. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted by the various states, the federal government of the United States, and various foreign jurisdictions. Privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent between jurisdictions. Various federal, state, and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact or adopt new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data retention, data transfer, and data protection. For example, California has enacted a new privacy law, known as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides to California consumers certain new access, deletion and opt-out rights related to their personal information, imposes civil penalties for violations and affords, in certain cases, a private right of action for data breaches. Compliance with the CCPA may require us to incur significant costs and expenses.\nCompliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our customers. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third-party service providers engaged by us) may also result in damage of reputation, result in vulnerabilities that could be exploited to breach our systems and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of personal information.\nWhile we maintain cyber insurance coverage to protect against these risks to the Company, such insurance is unlikely to fully mitigate the impact of any information breach.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of our Industry\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, as well as federal, state and local laws affecting business in general, which may harm our business.\nOur ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities are subject to extensive laws, regulations and ordinances, which are administered by the Illinois Gaming Board, Indiana Gaming Commission, Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, Kansas Lottery Commission, Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission, Louisiana State Gaming Control Board, Louisiana State Racing Commission, Mississippi Gaming Commission, Missouri Gaming Commission, Nevada Gaming Commission and Gaming Control Board, Ohio Lottery Commission and Ohio State Racing Commission, Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board and various other federal, state and local government entities and agencies. We are subject to regulations that apply specifically to the gaming industry and horse racetracks and casinos, including regulation with respect to gambling, live racing, and approval standards applicable to our directors, officers, key employees, joint venture partners and certain shareholders, in addition to regulations applicable to businesses generally, including regulation with respect to alcoholic beverages, smoking, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, anti-money laundering laws and regulations and marketing and advertising. A more detailed description of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is filed as Exhibit 99.1 herewith. If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals are introduced in the legislatures of some of the jurisdictions in which we have existing or planned operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and our company.\nTo date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, findings of suitability, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our properties. However, we can give no assurance that any additional licenses, permits and approvals that may be required will be given or that existing ones will be renewed or will not be revoked. Renewal is subject to, among other things, continued satisfaction of suitability requirements. Any failure to renew or maintain our licenses or to receive new licenses when necessary would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to extensive taxation policies, which may harm our business.\nThe federal government has, from time to time, considered a federal tax on casino revenues and may consider such a tax in the future. If such an increase were to be enacted, it could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flow. Our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future to finance casino development projects could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, gaming companies are often subject to significant state and local taxes and fees, in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time and which increase may be retroactive to prior years.\nIf there is any material increase in state and local taxes and fees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Properties\nWe own real property and are subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities, and could affect our ability to develop, sell or rent our property or to borrow money where such property is required to be used as collateral.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, including those governing discharges to air and water, the generation, handling, management and disposal of petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. Permits may be required for our operations and these permits are subject to renewal, modification and, in some cases, revocation. In addition, under environmental laws, ordinances or regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigation and removal or remediation of some kinds of hazardous substances or petroleum products on, under, or in its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they occurred. Additionally, as an owner or operator, we could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by them in connection with any contamination. The liability under those laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use our property.\nThe presence of, or failure to remediate properly, such substances may adversely affect the ability to sell or rent the property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral. Additionally, the owner of a site may be subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site.\nWe have reviewed environmental assessments, in some cases including soil and groundwater testing, relating to our currently owned and leased properties in Dubuque, Iowa, and other properties we may lease from the City of Dubuque or other parties. As a result, we have become aware that there is contamination present on some of these properties apparently due to past industrial activities.\nFuture developments regarding environmental matters could lead to material costs of environmental compliance for us and such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAdditionally, our horse racing operations are subject to oversight by the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), including regulations governing concentrated animal feeding operations and the related processing of animal waste water.\nWe own facilities that are located in areas that experience extreme weather conditions.\nExtreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas.\nFor example, certain of the properties we operate have been forced to close for extended periods due to floods and hurricanes. Most recently, Delta Downs was closed in for 21 days in 2020 due to Hurricane Laura.\nBelterra Park, Blue Chip, Par-A-Dice, Sam's Town Tunica, Sam's Town Shreveport and Treasure Chest are each located in an area that has been identified by the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\"FEMA\") as a special flood hazard area. Furthermore, our properties in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania are at risk of experiencing snowstorms, tornadoes and flooding.\nIn the past, snowstorms and other adverse weather conditions have interrupted our operations, damaged our properties and reduced the number of customers who visit our facilities in an affected area. These storms made it very difficult for our customers to visit, and we believe such winter weather had a material and adverse impact on the results of our operations during such times. If there is a prolonged disruption at any of our properties due to natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs and loss of revenue that we incur as a result of some extreme weather conditions, our coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits. There can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions. If any of our properties are damaged or if their operations are disrupted as a result of extreme weather in the future, or if extreme weather adversely impacts general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which they draw their patrons, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe draw a significant percentage of our customers from certain geographic regions. Events adversely impacting the economy or these regions, including public health outbreaks and man-made or natural disasters, may adversely impact our business.\nThe California, Fremont and Main Street Station draw a substantial portion of their customers from the Hawaiian market, with such customers historically comprising more than half of the room nights sold at each property. Decreases in discretionary consumer spending, as well as an increase in fuel costs or transportation prices, a decrease in airplane seat availability, or a deterioration of relations with tour and travel agents, particularly as they affect travel between the Hawaiian market and our facilities, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Recently, the portion of our business dependent upon our Hawaiian customers has been substantially disrupted as a result of COVID-19, including as a result of travel restrictions and quarantine requirements in Hawaii.\nOur Las Vegas properties also draw a substantial number of customers from certain other specific geographic areas, including the Southern California, Arizona and Las Vegas local markets. Due to our significant concentration of properties in Nevada, any man-made or natural disasters in or around Nevada, or the areas from which we draw customers to our Las Vegas properties, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our Las Vegas business has been materially impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and a reduction in visitation from customers in these geographic areas. Each of our properties located outside of Nevada depends primarily on visitors from their respective surrounding regions and are subject to comparable risk.\nThe strength and profitability of our business depends on consumer demand for hotel casino resorts in general and for the type of amenities our properties offer. Changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could harm our business. Terrorist activities in the United States and elsewhere, military conflicts, outbreaks of infectious disease and pandemics, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, among other things, have had negative impacts on travel and leisure expenditures. In addition, other factors affecting travel and discretionary consumer spending, including general economic conditions, disposable consumer income, fears of further economic decline and reduced consumer confidence in the economy, may negatively impact our business. We cannot predict the extent to which similar events and conditions may continue to affect us in the future. An extended period of reduced discretionary spending and/or disruptions or declines in tourism could significantly harm our operations.\nOur facilities, including our riverboats and dockside facilities, are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure and regulatory compliance.\nGenerally, all of our facilities are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time, as the result of casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, or extended or extraordinary maintenance, among other causes. In addition, our gaming operations, including those conducted on riverboats or at dockside facilities could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions.\nWe currently conduct our Treasure Chest, Par-A-Dice, Blue Chip, Sam's Town Shreveport, Amelia Belle and Belterra Resort gaming operations on riverboats. Each of our riverboats must comply with the United States Coast Guard (\"USCG\") requirements as to boat design, on-board facilities, equipment, personnel and safety. Each riverboat must hold a Certificate of Inspection for stabilization and flotation, and may also be subject to local zoning codes. The USCG requirements establish design standards, set limits on the operation of the vessels and require individual licensing of all personnel involved with the operation of the vessels. Loss of a vessel's Certificate of Inspection would preclude its use as a casino.\nUSCG regulations require a hull inspection for all riverboats at five-year intervals. Under certain circumstances, alternative hull inspections may be approved. The USCG may require that such hull inspections be conducted at a dry-docking facility, and if so required, the cost of travel to and from such docking facility, as well as the time required for inspections of the affected riverboats, could be significant. To date, the USCG has allowed in-place underwater inspections of our riverboats twice every five years on alternate two- and three-year schedules. The USCG may not continue to allow these types of inspections in the future. The loss of a dockside casino or riverboat casino from service for any period of time could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndiana and Louisiana have adopted alternate inspection standards for riverboats in those states. The standards require inspection by ABS Consulting (\"ABSC\"). ABSC inspection for our riverboats at Blue Chip, Treasure Chest and Sam's Town Shreveport commenced during 2010. The Amelia Belle is also inspected by the ABSC. The Par-A-Dice riverboat will remain inspected by the USCG for the foreseeable future. ABSC imposes essentially the same design, personnel, safety, and hull inspection standards as the USCG. Therefore, the risks to our business associated with USCG inspection should not change by reason of inspection by ABSC. Failure of a vessel to meet the applicable USCG or ABSC standards would preclude its use as a casino.\nUSCG regulations also require us to prepare and follow certain security programs. In 2004, we implemented the American Gaming Association's Alternative Security Program at our riverboat casinos and dockside facilities. The American Gaming Association's Alternative Security Program is specifically designed to address maritime security requirements at riverboat casinos and their respective dockside facilities. Only portions of those regulations will apply to our riverboats inspected by ABSC. Changes to these regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our hotels and casinos are located on leased property. If we default on one or more leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected hotel and/or casino.\nWe lease certain parcels of land on which Eastside Cannery, Suncoast, Belterra Resort, Belterra Park, Treasure Chest, Sam's Town Shreveport, IP, Ameristar Kansas City and Ameristar St. Charles' hotels and gaming facilities are located. In addition, we lease other parcels of land on which portions of the California and the Fremont are located. As a ground lessee, we have the right to use the leased land; however, we do not retain fee ownership in the underlying land. Accordingly, with respect to the leased land, we will have no interest in the land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases. Moreover, since we do not completely control the land underlying the property, a landowner could take certain actions to disrupt our rights in the land leased under the long-term leases. While such interruption is unlikely, such events are beyond our control. If the entity owning any leased land chose to disrupt our use either permanently or for a significant period of time, then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected. If we were to default on any one or more of these leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land, including the hotels and casinos. This would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had net operating losses (\"NOLs\") for federal income tax purposes. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change\" as defined in that section, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may become subject to significant limitations. We may experience an ownership change in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, which may result from the issuance of our common stock, the exercise of stock options and other equity compensation awards, as well as ordinary sales and purchases of our common stock, among other things. If an ownership change in our stock were to be triggered in the future, our subsequent ability to use any NOLs existing at that time could be significantly limited. Additionally, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act changed the carryback and carryforward periods for NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 and imposed annual limitations on the use of such NOLs. While the rules for NOLs generated in the year ended December 31, 2017 and prior did not change, our NOLs all predate the change, it is possible that future law changes could affect our ability to utilize NOLs prospectively.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries had approximately $3.9 billion of long-term debt (including debt of non-guarantor subsidiaries and without deducting unamortized discount and origination fees) as of December 31, 2020 (of which approximately $0.9 billion was outstanding under the Credit Facility) and which includes approximately $30.7 million of current maturities of long-term debt and excludes approximately $12.6 million in aggregate outstanding letters of credit. In addition, an aggregate amount of approximately $1,021.1 million was available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020.\nIf we pursue, or continue to pursue, any expansion, development, investment or renovation projects requiring capital beyond our available borrowing capacity, we expect that our long-term debt will substantially increase in connection with related capital expenditures. This indebtedness could have important consequences, including: difficulty in satisfying our obligations under our current indebtedness; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds.\nOur debt instruments contain, and any future debt instruments likely will contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt, including providing guarantees or credit support; incur liens securing indebtedness or other obligations; make certain investments; dispose of assets; make certain acquisitions; pay dividends or make distributions and make other restricted payments; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; engage in any new businesses; and enter into transactions with our stockholders and our affiliates.\nIn addition, our Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, including, without limitation, various covenants: (i) requiring the maintenance of a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 1.75 to 1.00; (ii) establishing a maximum permitted consolidated total leverage ratio; and (iii) establishing a maximum permitted secured leverage ratio.\nFailure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNote 7, Long-Term Debt, included in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8, contains further disclosure regarding our current outstanding debt.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nIt is unlikely that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under the Credit Facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to retire our indebtedness as such indebtedness matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. We believe that we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, at or before maturity, and cannot provide assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners. These financing strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, certain states\u2019 laws contain restrictions on the ability of companies engaged in the gaming business to undertake certain financing transactions. Some restrictions may prevent us from obtaining necessary capital.\nWe and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the indentures governing our senior notes do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are effectively senior to our senior notes and the guarantees of our subsidiary guarantors to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such borrowings. If new debt is added to our, or our subsidiaries', current debt levels, the related risks that we or they now face could intensify.\nWe are required to pay a substantial amount of rent pursuant to our Master Lease agreements with GLPI, which impacts free cash flow and could in the future limit our ability to invest in our operations or seek additional development or strategic opportunities.\nWe lease the real estate of Ameristar Kansas City, Ameristar St. Charles, Belterra Casino Resort and Belterra Park (each an \"OpCo,\" and collectively the \"OpCos\") from Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (\"GLPI\"), pursuant to two triple net REIT Master Leases (the \"Master Leases\"). Current annual rent under the Master Leases is $101.9 million, with rental increases over time. The Master Leases also include substantial additional obligations that may require future uses of free cash flow, including obligations to maintain and repair the properties, including minimum annual capital investment requirements, and provides that we have assumed the risk of loss with respect to any casualty or condemnation event, including the obligation to repair or rebuild the facility.\nThese obligations, which could significantly impact free cash flow, could in the future adversely impact our ability to invest in our operations or seek additional development or strategic opportunities. For example, our obligations under the Leases may:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to prepay or repay our long-term debt and to obtain additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022 limit our ability to respond to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including pursuing new markets and additional lines of business, development opportunities, acquisitions and other strategic investments that we would otherwise pursue.\nAny of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Master Leases include additional provisions that restrict our ability to freely operate and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including the following:\n\u2022\nEscalations in Rent - We are obligated to pay base rent under the Master Leases, and base rent is composed of building base rent and land base rent. Every year of a Master Lease's term, building base rent is subject to an annual escalation of up to 2% and we may be required to pay the escalated building base rent regardless of our revenues, profit or general financial condition.\n\u2022\nVariable Rent - We are obligated to pay percentage rent under the Master Leases, which is re-calculated every two years. Such percentage rent shall equal 4% of the change between (i) the average net revenues for the trailing two-year period and (ii) 50% of the trailing 12 months net revenues as of the month ending immediately prior to the execution of the Master Leases. We may be required to pay an increase in percentage rent based on increases in net revenues without a corresponding increase in our profits.\n\u2022\nPooled Lease - One of our Master Leases is a pooled lease arrangement, which prohibits us from divesting any individual OpCo without GLPI\u2019s prior consent. Any divestiture of all of the OpCos also requires GLPI\u2019s prior consent, except for limited circumstances where the purchaser meets various financial and gaming operations experience requirements. These limitations on transfer could adversely impact our ability to manage our business.\n\u2022\nGuaranties - One of our Master Lease Agreements is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the tenant (the \"Lease Guarantors\"). A default under any of such Master Lease guaranties that is not cured within the applicable grace period will constitute an event of default under the Master Lease.\n\u2022\nEffect of End of Term or Not Renewing the Master Leases - If we do not renew the Master Leases at the stipulated renewals or we do not enter into new master leases at the end of the applicable terms, we will be required to sell the business of the relevant tenant. If we cannot agree upon acceptable terms of sale with a qualified successor tenant, GLPI will select a successor tenant to purchase our business through a competitive auction. If this occurs, we will be required to transfer our business to the highest bidder at the auction, subject to regulatory approvals.\nRisks Related to our Equity Ownership\nCertain of our stockholders own large interests in our capital stock and may significantly influence our affairs.\nWilliam S. Boyd, our Co-Executive Chair of the Board of Directors, together with his immediate family, beneficially owned approximately 26% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2020. As such, the Boyd family has the ability to significantly influence our affairs, including the election of members of our Board of Directors and, except as otherwise provided by law, approving or disapproving other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including a merger, consolidation, or sale of assets.", "PERMNO": 79758, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "BYD"}
