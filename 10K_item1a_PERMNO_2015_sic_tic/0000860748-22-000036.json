{"cik": "860748", "company": "KEMPER Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nKemper is exposed to numerous risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from recent results or anticipated future results. The following discussion details the significant risk factors that are specific to the Company. In addition to those described below, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by other factors not presently known or considered material by the Company. Readers are advised to consider all of these factors along with the other information included in this 2021 Annual Report, including the factors set forth under the caption \u201cCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 1, and to consult any further disclosures Kemper makes on related subjects in its filings with the SEC.\nRisks Relating to Estimating Property and Casualty Insurance Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses and Catastrophes\nEstimating losses and LAE for determining property and casualty insurance reserves is inherently uncertain, and the Company\u2019s results of operations may be materially impacted if the Company\u2019s insurance reserves are insufficient.\nThe Company establishes loss and LAE reserves to cover estimated liabilities, which remain unpaid as of the end of each accounting period, and to investigate and settle all claims incurred under the property and casualty insurance policies that it has issued. Loss and LAE reserves are established for claims that have been reported to the Company as of the end of the accounting period, as well as for estimated claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the Company. The estimates of loss and LAE reserves are based on the Company\u2019s assessment of the facts and circumstances known to it at the time, as well as estimates of the impact of future trends in the severity of claims, the frequency of claims and other factors.\nThese estimates can be inaccurate or may change over time due to many variables, including changes driven by the evolving legal and regulatory landscape and economic conditions in which the Company operates and the rising costs of insurance claims from increased litigation, higher jury awards, broader definitions of liability and other effects of societal trends referred to as social inflation. In recent periods, these estimates have been impacted by the effect the COVID-19 pandemic and the related governmental responses have had on certain of these variables. See the risk factor below titled \u201cThe impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions could materially affect Kemper\u2019s results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.\u201d\nThe process of estimating property and casualty insurance reserves is complex and imprecise. The reserves established by the Company are inherently uncertain estimates and could prove to be inadequate to cover its ultimate losses and expenses. The estimate of the ultimate cost of claims for insured events that have occurred must take into consideration many factors that are dependent on the outcome of future events associated with the reporting, investigation and settlement of claims. The impacts on the Company\u2019s estimates of property and casualty insurance reserves from these factors are difficult to assess accurately. A change in any one or more of the factors is likely to result in a projected ultimate loss that is different than the previous projected ultimate loss and may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s estimates. Increases in the estimates of ultimate losses and LAE will decrease earnings, while decreases in these estimates will increase earnings, as reported by the Company in the results of its operations for the periods in which the changes to the estimates are made. See MD&A, \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates,\u201d under the caption \u201cProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\u201d beginning on page 62 for a discussion of the Company\u2019s reserving process and the factors considered by the Company\u2019s actuaries in estimating the Company\u2019s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves.\nIf the Company is unable to charge competitive yet profitable rates to its customers, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company considers trends in the severity and frequency of claims and other factors when determining the premium rates to charge for its property and casualty insurance products. An unanticipated change in any one or more of these factors or trends, as well as a change in competitive conditions, may result in inadequate premium rates charged for insurance policies issued by Kemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries in the future. Typically there is a time lag between when changes in frequency and severity are identified and when rate changes are approved, implemented and earned in. Material changes in frequency and severity and the time lag between when rates are approved, implemented and earned into the Company\u2019s results of operations may have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operations. Because of restrictions placed on the Company\u2019s ability to increase premium rates in certain states, including California, a pricing inadequacy may continue for a prolonged period. These pricing inadequacies have and could continue to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operating results. If the Company overestimates the severity or frequency of claims and other factors in determining the rates to charge for insurance products, the rates for the Company\u2019s products could be noncompetitive and result in loss of revenue and market share.\nCatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nKemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, severe winter weather, wildfires and pandemics, and may also include man-made events, such as terrorist attacks and hazardous material spills. The incidence, frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and may be impacted by the uncertain effects of climate change. The extent of the Company\u2019s losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of its insured exposure in the geographic area affected by the event and the severity of the event. The Company could experience more than one severe catastrophic event in any given period.\nThe property and casualty insurance subsidiaries use catastrophe modeling tools developed by third parties to project their potential exposure to property damage resulting from certain types of catastrophic events under various scenarios. These models are based on various assumptions and judgments which may turn out to be wrong. The actual impact of one or more catastrophic events could adversely and materially differ from these projections.\nKemper\u2019s life and health insurance subsidiaries are particularly exposed to risks of catastrophic mortality, such as pandemics or other events that result in large numbers of deaths. For example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased mortality that has had an adverse impact on our life and health business. See the risk factor below titled \u201cThe impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions could materially affect Kemper\u2019s results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.\u201d In addition, the occurrence of such an event in a concentrated geographic area could have a severe disruptive effect on the Company\u2019s workforce and business operations. The likelihood and severity of such events cannot be predicted and are difficult to estimate.\nChanges in the availability and cost of catastrophe reinsurance and in the ability of reinsurers to meet their obligations could result in Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries retaining more risk and could adversely and materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nKemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries seek to reduce their exposure to catastrophe losses through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. Catastrophe reinsurance does not relieve these subsidiaries of their direct liability to their policyholders. As long as the reinsurers meet their obligations, the net liability for each subsidiary is limited to the amount of risk it retains. While Kemper\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 principal reinsurers are each rated \u201cA-\u201d or better by A.M. Best at the time reinsurance is purchased, the Company cannot be certain that reinsurers will pay the amounts due from them either now, in the future, or on a timely basis. A reinsurer\u2019s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn addition, market conditions beyond the Company\u2019s control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection that Kemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries may purchase. A decrease in the amount of reinsurance coverage that these subsidiaries purchase generally should increase their risk of a more severe loss. If the amount of available reinsurance is reduced, the cost to obtain reinsurance may increase or Kemper\u2019s subsidiaries may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect their ability to write future insurance policies or result in their retaining more risk with respect to those policies.\nThe extent to which Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries can manage their catastrophe exposure through underwriting strategies may be limited by law or regulatory action and could adversely and materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nKemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also manage their exposure to catastrophe losses through underwriting strategies such as reducing exposures in, or withdrawing from, catastrophe-prone areas, establishing appropriate guidelines for insurable structures, and setting appropriate rates, deductibles, exclusions and policy limits. The extent to which Kemper\u2019s subsidiaries can manage their exposure through these strategies may be limited by law or regulatory action. For example, laws and regulations may limit the rate or timing at which insurers may non-renew insurance policies in catastrophe-prone areas or require insurers to participate in wind pools and joint underwriting associations. Generally, participation in these pools and associations is based on an insurer\u2019s market share determined on a state-wide basis. Accordingly, even though Kemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries may not incur a direct insured loss as a result of managing direct catastrophe exposures, they may incur indirect losses from required participation in pools and associations. In addition, laws and regulations requiring prior approval of policy forms and premium rates may limit the ability of Kemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance\nsubsidiaries to increase rates or deductibles on a timely basis, which may result in additional losses or lower returns than otherwise would have occurred in an unregulated market.\nRisks Relating to Competition\nA downgrade in the ratings of Kemper or its insurance subsidiaries below A- could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nThird-party rating agencies assess the financial strength and rate the claims-paying ability of insurance companies based on criteria established by the rating agencies. Third-party ratings are important competitive factors in the insurance industry. Financial strength ratings are used to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers. Ratings agencies may downgrade the ratings of Kemper and/or its insurance subsidiaries or require Kemper to retain more capital in its insurance businesses to maintain existing ratings following developments that they deem negative. This can include factors directly related to the Company, such as an increase in the catastrophic risk retained by Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, or developments in industry or general economic conditions. A downgrade by A.M. Best in the ratings of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries below A-, particularly those operating in the preferred and standard market or offering homeowners insurance, could result in a substantial loss of business if independent agents and brokers or policyholders move to other companies with higher claims-paying and financial strength ratings. Any substantial loss of business could materially and adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of such subsidiaries. A downgrade in Kemper\u2019s credit rating by Standard & Poor\u2019s (\u201cS&P\u201d), Moody\u2019s Investors Services (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) or Fitch Ratings (\u201cFitch\u201d) may reduce Kemper\u2019s ability to cost-effectively access the capital markets or may increase the cost to refinance existing debt.\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive, making it difficult to grow profitability and within expectations of investors.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance businesses face significant competition, and their ability to compete is affected by a variety of issues relative to others in the industry, such as management effectiveness, product pricing, service quality, ease of doing business, innovation, financial strength and name recognition. Competitive success is based on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Competitiveness of prices charged for insurance policies;\n\u2022Sophistication of pricing segmentation;\n\u2022Design and introduction of insurance products to meet emerging consumer trends;\n\u2022Ability to attract and retain experienced industry talent;\n\u2022Selection and retention of agents and other business partners;\n\u2022Compensation paid to agents;\n\u2022Underwriting discipline;\n\u2022Selectiveness of sales markets;\n\u2022Effectiveness of marketing materials and name recognition;\n\u2022Product and technological innovation;\n\u2022Effectiveness of online servicing platforms;\n\u2022Ability to settle claims timely and efficiently;\n\u2022Ability to detect and prevent fraudulent insurance claims;\n\u2022Effectiveness of deployment and use of information technology across all aspects of operations;\n\u2022Ability to control operating expenses;\n\u2022Financial strength ratings;\n\u2022Quality of services provided to, and ease of doing business with, independent agents and brokers or policyholders.\nThe inability to compete effectively in any of the Company\u2019s insurance businesses could materially reduce the Company\u2019s customer base and revenues and could materially and adversely affect the future results and financial condition of the Company.\nSee \u201cCompetition\u201d in Item 1 of Part I beginning on page 9 and page 11 for more information on the competitive rankings in the property and casualty insurance markets and the life and health insurance markets, respectively, in the United States.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Environment\nKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation, and the evolving legal and regulatory landscape in which they operate could result in increased operating costs, reduced profitability and limited growth.\nKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries operate under an extensive insurance regulatory system. Current laws and regulations affect a wide variety of matters, including policy forms, premium rates, licensing, market conduct, trade practices, claims handling\npractices, reserve and loss ratio requirements, investment standards, statutory capital and surplus requirements, restrictions on the payment of dividends, approvals of transactions involving a change in control of one or more insurance companies, restrictions on transactions among affiliates and consumer privacy and data security. Kemper subsidiaries must also file annual and quarterly financial reports and holding company reports. Pre-approval requirements often restrict or delay actions to implement premium rate changes for insurance policies, or to introduce new, or make changes to existing, policy forms and many other actions. These delays can adversely impact Kemper\u2019s business, especially where external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in a pricing imbalance for the Company\u2019s insurance products.\nInsurance regulators conduct periodic examinations of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries and can suspend or delay operations or licenses, require corrective actions, and impose penalties or other remedies available for compliance failures. For a more detailed discussion of the regulations applicable to Kemper\u2019s subsidiaries and related emerging developments, see \u201cRegulation\u201d in Item 1, beginning on page 12.\nThese laws and regulations, and their application by regulators and courts, are subject to continuous interpretation and revision. The legal and regulatory landscape within which Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries conduct their businesses is often unpredictable. As industry practices and regulatory, judicial, political, social and other conditions change, new issues may emerge. These changes and emerging issues could adversely affect Kemper\u2019s business in a variety of ways, including, for example, by expanding coverages beyond the underwriting intent, increasing the number or size of claims, accelerating the payment of claims or otherwise adding to operational costs or adversely affecting the Company\u2019s competitive advantages. Practices in the industry or within the Company that were once considered approved, compliant and reasonable may suddenly be deemed unacceptable by virtue of a court or regulatory ruling or changes in regulatory enforcement policies and practices. It is not possible for the Company to predict such shifts in legal or regulatory enforcement or to accurately estimate the impact they may have on the Company and its operations.\nOne area where the legal and regulatory landscape experienced significant change is in connection with the mandated use of death verification databases by life insurance companies. A majority of states now have laws requiring insurers to proactively use such databases, including the Social Security Administration\u2019s Death Master File (the \u201cDMF\u201d), in order to ascertain if an insured may be deceased. Kemper cannot predict whether additional states will enact similar legislation. These laws require the insurer to initiate the claims process even though the insureds\u2019 beneficiaries have not submitted a claim and the insurer was otherwise unaware of the insured\u2019s death. In a related development, many states expanded their unclaimed property laws, particularly as they relate to life insurance proceeds, and have examined life insurance companies with respect to the reporting and remittance of such proceeds under these laws. The push to alter practices previously considered lawful and appropriate relative to both claims handling and remittance of life insurance proceeds has led to the Company\u2019s involvement in compliance audits, market conduct examinations and litigation. The Company has a comprehensive process in place to compare life insurance records against the DMF and other databases to determine if any of its insureds may be deceased. See Note 2, \u201cSummary of Accounting Policies and Accounting Changes,\u201d and Note 24 \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nIn addition, there is increased legislative and regulatory focus on cybersecurity and on amendments to state holding company laws that expand the oversight and examination powers of insurance regulators beyond licensed insurance companies to include non-insurance affiliates and their organizations as a whole, particularly with respect to enterprise risk. See the discussion of these matters under \u201cRegulation\u201d in Item 1, beginning on page 12.\nThese developments and significant changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws and regulations could make it more expensive for Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries to conduct and grow their businesses which could materially impact the Company\u2019s operating results.\nKemper has a significant concentration of personal automobile insurance business in California and Florida, and negative developments in the regulatory, legal or economic conditions in these states may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nCalifornia and Florida represented 69% of the Company\u2019s total personal automobile insurance gross written premiums in 2021. Consequently, the dynamic nature of regulatory, legal, competitive and economic conditions in these states affects Kemper\u2019s revenues and profitability. For example, in Florida, increased severity in personal injury protection coverage has resulted in significant adverse loss and LAE reserve development in 2021. Further, both California and Florida have regulations that limit the after-tax return on underwriting profit allowed for an insurer. Changes in any of these conditions could negatively impact the Company's results of operations.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings are unpredictable and could produce one or more unexpected outcomes that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results for any given period.\nKemper and its subsidiaries are from time to time involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of their businesses. Some of these proceedings may involve matters particular to Kemper or one or more of its subsidiaries, while others may pertain to industry business practices. Some lawsuits may seek class action status that, if granted, could expose the Company to potentially significant liability by virtue of the size of the putative classes. These matters often raise difficult factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities. The outcomes of these matters are difficult to predict, and the amounts or ranges of potential loss at particular stages in the proceedings are in most cases difficult or impossible to ascertain. Even where the possibility of an adverse outcome is remote under traditional legal analysis, juries sometimes substitute their subjective views in place of facts and established legal principles. Given the unpredictability of the legal and regulatory landscape in which the Company operates, there can be no assurance that one or more of these matters will not produce a result that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results for any given period.\nFor information about the Company\u2019s pending legal proceedings, see Note 24, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nChanges in the availability of insurance coverage or in the ability of insurers to meet their obligations could result in the Company being exposed to significant losses.\nKemper maintains insurance coverage to limit its risk exposure to certain perils, including cybersecurity, errors and omissions, directors and officers liability insurance, and other financial indemnity coverages. The availability of these coverages could be significantly reduced in the future and there is no guarantee that if coverage is available it will be in an amount sufficient to cover the losses of one or more covered incidents or on terms that Kemper finds acceptable. An insurer\u2019s insolvency or inability to make payments under the insurance coverage it provides to Kemper could also result in Kemper being exposed to significant losses.\nRisks Relating to Security of Personal Data, Availability of Critical Systems, and Technology Initiatives\nFailure to protect against system security breaches that compromise personal data held by the Company or its business partners could result in business interruption, legal and consulting fees, regulatory penalties, litigation, lost business, reputational harm, and other liabilities and expenses.\nKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries obtain, process and store vast amounts of personal data that can present significant risks to the Company and its customers, employees and other affected individuals. An increasing array of laws and regulations govern the use, transfer and storage of such data, including, for example, social security numbers, credit card data, driver\u2019s license numbers and protected health information. The Company uses an array of sophisticated security measures and policies and procedures designed to enhance security of the Company\u2019s data systems. Notwithstanding these efforts, the Company\u2019s data systems, as well as those of third party administrators and other business partners working on behalf of the Company, are vulnerable to security breaches due to the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyber attacks, viruses, ransomware, spyware and other malware and infiltration methods, hackers and other external hazards, as well as equipment and system failures and inadvertent errors, negligence or intentional misconduct of employees and/or contractors. The Company also relies on the ability of its business partners to maintain secure systems and processes that comply with legal requirements and protect personal data. The Company and its third party administrators and other business partners regularly defend against and respond to data security threats and investigate and remediate breaches that have occurred.\nSystem security breaches can result in data loss, business interruption, ransom demands, investigations and litigation. The Company has been and may continue to be exposed to damages, regulatory penalties and other liabilities, reputational risk and significant increases in compliance and litigation costs.\nIf Kemper is unable to send or accept electronic payments, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe Company relies increasingly on electronic payments from policyholders, including, but not limited to, payment by credit and debit cards. Kemper\u2019s ability to use electronic payments depends on its ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations and with the rules of the various payment networks. Failure to maintain compliance with laws and industry rules and regulations governing such transactions could result in additional costs and damages. For example, in the event of non-compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, an information security framework for organizations that handle cardholder information for the major debit, credit, prepaid, and other payment card methods, Kemper\u2019s insurance\nsubsidiaries could be prohibited from collecting premium payments from customers by way of such methods and be subject to significant fines.\nFailure to maintain the availability of critical systems could result in business interruption, lost business, reputational harm, penalties and other costs.\nThe Company\u2019s business operations rely on the continuous availability of its own computer systems, systems and software hosted by vendors, and computer systems used by third party administrators and contractors working on behalf of the Company. From time to time these systems have been, and may again be, adversely affected or disrupted by cyber attacks or other data breaches, natural and man-made catastrophes or other significant events. The failure of the Company, or its third party administrators or other business partners, to maintain business continuity in the wake of such events may prevent the timely performance of critical processes across its operations, including, for example, insurance policy administration, claims processing, billing, payment processing, treasury and investment operations and payroll and other employer-related functions. These failures could result in significant loss of business, increased costs, fines and other adverse consequences.\nTechnology initiatives could present significant economic and competitive challenges to the Company. Failure to complete and implement such initiatives in a timely manner could result in the loss of business and incurrence of internal use software development costs that may not be recoverable.\nData and analytics play an increasingly important role in the insurance industry. The Company may periodically initiate multi-year technology projects to enhance operations or replace systems. While technology developments can facilitate the use and enhance the value of data and analytics, streamline business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives can present significant economic and organizational challenges to the Company and potential short-term cost and implementation risks. In addition, projections of expenses and implementation schedules could change materially and costs could escalate over time, while the ultimate utility of a technology initiative could deteriorate over time.\nDue to the highly-regulated nature of the financial services industry, the Company also faces rising costs and competing time constraints in adapting technology to meet compliance requirements of new and proposed regulations. The costs to develop and implement systems to replace the Company\u2019s existing systems and to comply with new regulatory requirements as needed are expected to be material. Due to the complexities involved, there can be no assurances that new system development and implementation projects will be successful, that the costs for such projects will not exceed estimates and that the incurred costs will be recoverable. Furthermore, failure to implement replacement systems in a timely manner could result in loss of business from the Company\u2019s delay or inability to design and introduce new insurance products that meet emerging consumer needs and competitive trends.\nRisks Relating to Investments\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio is exposed to a variety of risks that may negatively impact net investment income, the change in fair value of equity and convertible securities and cause realized and unrealized losses.\nThe Company maintains a diversified investment portfolio that is exposed to significant financial and capital market risks, including interest rate (risk-free and spread), equity price, and liquidity, as well as risks from changes in tax laws and regulations and other risks from changes in general economic conditions.\nThe interest rate environment has a significant impact on the Company\u2019s financial results and position. In recent years, rates have been at or near historic lows. A protracted low interest rate environment would continue to place pressure on net investment income, particularly related to fixed income securities, short-term investments and limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships accounted for under the equity method of accounting (\u201cEquity Method Limited Liability Investments\u201d) that invest in distressed and mezzanine debt of other companies. A decline in interest rates would generally increase the carrying value of the Company\u2019s fixed income securities and its Equity Method Limited Liability Investments that exhibit debt-like characteristics, but it may adversely affect the Company\u2019s investment income as it invests cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolio\u2019s average rate. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may seek to refinance their borrowings at lower rates and, accordingly, prepay or redeem securities the Company holds as investments more quickly than the Company initially expected. Such prepayment or redemption action may cause the Company to reinvest the redeemed proceeds in lower yielding investments. An increase in interest rates would generally reduce the carrying value of a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, particularly fixed income securities and Equity Method Limited Liability Investments.\nKemper\u2019s Life and Health business writes long duration insurance contracts which are priced in consideration of the interest rate environment. If the Company is not able to purchase investments that match that duration of the liabilities and there is a\ndecline in interest rates, the Company could experience a significant deterioration in results.\nThe Company invests a portion of its investment portfolio in equity securities, which generally have more volatile returns than fixed income securities and may experience sustained periods of depressed values. There are multiple factors that could negatively impact the performance of the Company\u2019s equity portfolio, including general economic conditions, industry or sector deterioration and issuer-specific concerns. A decline in equity values will result in losses being recognized by the Company in the period such change in fair value occurs, which may be significant. In addition, a decline in equity values may result in a decrease in dividend income.\nInterest rates and equity returns also have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s pension and other post-retirement employee benefit plans. In addition to the impact on carrying values and yields of the underlying assets of the funded plans, interest rates also impact the discounting of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations of the plans. A decrease in interest rates may have a negative impact on the funded status of the plans.\nThe nature and cash flow needs of the Company present certain liquidity risks that may impact the return of the investment portfolio. If the Company were to experience several significant catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time, investments may have to be sold in advance of their maturity dates to fund payments to claimants, which could result in realized losses. Additionally, increases in illiquidity in the financial markets may increase uncertainty in the valuations of the Company\u2019s investments. This increases the risk that the fair values reported in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual price that may be obtained in an orderly sales transaction.\nThe Company has also benefited from certain tax laws related to its investment portfolio, including dividends received deductions and tax-exempt investment income. Changes in tax laws may have a detrimental effect on the after-tax return of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio. A reduction in income tax rates could also reduce the demand for tax-preferenced securities and result in a decline in the value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio of such securities.\nThe Company\u2019s entire investment portfolio is subject to broad risks inherent in the financial markets, including, but not limited to, inflation, regulatory changes, inactive capital markets, governmental and social stability, economic outlooks, unemployment and recession. Changes to these risks and how the market perceives them may impact the financial performance of the Company\u2019s investments.\nKemper and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to various capital adequacy measurements that are significantly impacted by various characteristics of their invested assets, including, but not limited to, asset type, class, duration and credit rating. The Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are also subject to various limitations on the amounts at which they can invest in individual assets or certain asset classes in the aggregate. Asset risk is one factor used by insurance regulators and rating agencies to determine required capital for Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries. Accordingly, a deterioration in the quality of the investments held by Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries or an increase in the investment risk inherent in their investment portfolios could increase capital requirements. See the risk factor below titled \u201cThe ability of Kemper to service its debt, pay dividends to its shareholders and/or fund targeted transactions may be materially impacted by lack of timely and/or sufficient dividends received from its subsidiaries.\u201d These factors may inhibit the Company from shifting its investment mix to produce higher returns. The Company is also subject to concentration of investment risk to the extent that the portfolio is heavily invested, at any particular time, in specific asset types, classes, industries, sectors or collateral types, among other defining features. Developments and the market\u2019s perception thereof in any of these concentrations may exacerbate the negative effects on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio compared to other companies.\nThe determination of the fair values of the Company\u2019s investments and whether a decline in the fair value of an investment is other-than-temporary are based on management\u2019s judgment and may prove to be materially different than the actual economic outcome.\nThe Company holds a significant amount of assets without readily available, active, quoted market prices or for which fair value cannot be measured from actively quoted prices. These assets are generally deemed to require a higher degree of judgment in measuring fair value. The assumptions used by management to measure fair values could turn out to be different than the actual amounts that may be realized in an orderly transaction with a willing market participant could be either lower or higher than the Company\u2019s estimates of fair value.\nThe Company reviews its investment portfolio for factors that may indicate that a decline in the fair value of an investment is other-than-temporary. This evaluation is based on subjective factors, assumptions and estimates and may be materially different than the actual economic outcome, which may result in the Company recognizing additional losses in the future as new information emerges or recognizing losses currently that may never materialize in the future in an orderly transaction with a willing market participant.\nRisks Relating to Servicing Debt, Paying Dividends and/or Fund Targeted Transactions\nThe ability of Kemper to service its debt, pay dividends to its shareholders and/or fund targeted transactions may be materially impacted by lack of timely and/or sufficient dividends received from its subsidiaries.\nAs a holding company, Kemper depends on the dividend income that it receives from its subsidiaries as a primary source of funds to meet its payment obligations. Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions under state insurance laws and regulations that limit their ability to declare and pay dividends. These laws and regulations impose minimum solvency and liquidity requirements on dividends between affiliated companies and require prior notice to, and may require approval from, state insurance regulators before dividends can be paid. In addition, third-party rating agencies monitor statutory capital and surplus levels for capital adequacy. Even though a dividend may be payable without regulatory approval, an insurance subsidiary may forgo paying a dividend to Kemper and retain the capital to maintain or improve ratings or to offset increases in required capital from increases in premium volume or investment risk. The inability of one or more of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries to pay sufficient dividends to Kemper may materially affect Kemper\u2019s ability to pay its debt obligations on time, pay dividends to its shareholders or undertake funding for targeted transactions.\nGeneral Risks Relating to Mergers, Acquisitions and/or Divestitures\nThe expected benefits and synergies from mergers, acquisitions and/or divestitures may not be realized to the extent anticipated or within the anticipated time frames.\nThe Company routinely evaluates opportunities for transactions such as mergers, acquisitions and/or divestitures that would enhance its business and align with the Company\u2019s strategic plans. Kemper\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated financial benefits from transactions may not be realized due to any number of factors, including, but not limited to, integration difficulties or failures, the loss of key agents/brokers, customers or employees, unexpected or underestimated liabilities, increased costs, fees, expenses and charges related to transactions, or may be delayed by factors outside of the Company\u2019s control. Furthermore, these adverse events could result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets established as a result of such transactions, triggering an impairment. These and other factors could have a negative impact on Kemper\u2019s financial condition, profitability and results from operations.\nRisks Relating to COVID-19\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic conditions have had and could continue to have a material effect on Kemper\u2019s results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.\nBeginning in March 2020, the global pandemic related to the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 began to adversely impact the global economy and resulted in an enormous global economic downturn, including in the United States where the Company conducts its operations. While overall economic activity rebounded significantly in 2021, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continued throughout 2021.\nAs the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related economic consequences, including governmental responses to the pandemic and the effects of the dramatic surge in economic activity as pandemic lockdowns ended, the Company experienced in 2021 a significant increase in loss frequency and severity in its Property and Casualty line of business. In addition, increased mortality resulting from the pandemic adversely impacted the Life and Health line of business. As the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt, the Company could be subject to the following risks, any of which could individually or collectively have a material, adverse effect on its business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u2022Decrease in overall premium volumes due to economic disruption and rising unemployment rates\n\u2022Adverse impact on economic conditions, including increased rate of inflation, negative impact on employment levels, supply chain disruptions and changing consumer patterns that could impact Kemper\u2019s businesses\n\u2022Adverse impact on investment portfolio as a result of ratings downgrades, increased bankruptcies and credit spread widening in distressed industries\n\u2022Increase in estimated credit losses on fixed maturity investments held at fair value as well as other investments and receivables from policyholders\n\u2022Higher incurred losses and LAE in Life and Health lines of business related to an increase in frequency and/or severity of claims\n\u2022Regulatory actions imposing new requirements that could result in increased costs, reduced revenues, expansion of coverage and other effects, and additional restrictions that could affect the Company\u2019s pricing, risk selection and\nparticular rights and obligations under its insurance policies and with regard to its insureds, including the ability to cancel policies and collect premiums\n\u2022Increased cybersecurity risks due to remote working arrangements and resulting changes in certain operational controls\nRisks Relating to General Economic and Market Factors\nChanges in the global economy and capital markets could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant changes in the economic and capital market environment could adversely affect consumer demands for the Company\u2019s products, results of operations, investment returns and financial condition. The following are examples of economic market conditions that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial liquidity and results of operations:\n\u2022Volatility in debt and equity markets\n\u2022Changes in interest rates\n\u2022Increases in inflation\n\u2022Reduced availability of credit\n\u2022Economic downturns\n\u2022Increased unemployment and reduced consumer spending\nStressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets or financial asset classes could adversely affect our investment portfolio.", "PERMNO": 76136, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "KMPR"}
