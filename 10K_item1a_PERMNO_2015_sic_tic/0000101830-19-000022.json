{"cik": "101830", "company": "SPRINT Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-05-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us. Our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nRisks Relating to the Merger Transactions\nThe closing of the Merger Transactions is subject to many conditions, including the receipt of approvals from various governmental entities, which may not approve the Merger Transactions, may delay the approvals for, or may impose conditions or restrictions on, jeopardize or delay completion of, or reduce the anticipated benefits of, the Merger Transactions, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger Transactions will not be completed.\nThe completion of the Merger Transactions is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, obtaining certain governmental authorizations, consents, orders or other approvals and the absence of any injunction prohibiting the Merger Transactions or any legal requirements enacted by a court or other governmental entity preventing consummation of the Merger Transactions. While Sprint has received certain of such approvals, Sprint continues to seek to obtain various other required approvals. There is no assurance that these required authorizations, consents, orders or other approvals will be obtained or that they will be obtained in a timely manner, or whether they will be subject to required actions, conditions, limitations or restrictions on our, T-Mobile\u2019s or the combined company\u2019s business, operations or assets. If any such required actions, conditions, limitations or restrictions are imposed, they may jeopardize or delay completion of the Merger Transactions, reduce or delay the anticipated benefits of the Merger Transactions or allow the parties to terminate the Merger Transactions, which could result in a material adverse effect on our, T-Mobile\u2019s or the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition or operating results. In addition, the completion of the Merger Transactions is also subject to T-Mobile USA having specified minimum credit ratings on the closing date of the Merger Transactions (after giving effect to the Merger Transactions) from at least two of the three credit rating agencies, subject to certain qualifications.\nFailure to complete the Merger Transactions, or a delay in completing the Merger Transactions, could negatively impact our stock price and the future business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition and results of operations of us or the combined company.\nIf the Merger Transactions are not completed or are delayed, our common stock price and future business and financial results could be negatively affected, or our employees, suppliers, vendors, distributors, retailers, dealers or customers could lose focus on our business, cease doing business with us, or curtail their activities with us. In addition, the Business Combination Agreement may be terminated if, among other things, required regulatory approvals or consents are not obtained or either party breaches certain of its obligations under the Business Combination Agreement. Subject to certain extension rights, the Business Combination Agreement may be terminated by either Sprint or T-Mobile on July 29, 2019. If the Business Combination Agreement were terminated, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.\nWe and T-Mobile are subject to various uncertainties and contractual restrictions and requirements while the Merger Transactions are pending that could disrupt our, T-Mobile\u2019s or the combined company\u2019s business and adversely affect our or T-Mobile\u2019s business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger Transactions on employees, customers, suppliers, vendors, distributors, dealers and retailers has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on us and T-Mobile. These uncertainties may impair our and T-Mobile\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel during the pendency of the Merger Transactions and, if the Merger Transactions are completed, for a period of time thereafter, as existing and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us or T-Mobile, our and T-Mobile\u2019s business following the Merger Transactions could be negatively impacted. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause customers, suppliers, distributors, dealers, retailers and others who deal with us or T-Mobile to seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us or T-Mobile or fail to renew existing relationships with us or T-Mobile. Suppliers, distributors and content and application providers may also delay or cease developing for us or T-Mobile new products that are necessary for the operations of our or T-Mobile\u2019s business due to the uncertainty created by the Merger Transactions. Competitors may also target our or T-Mobile\u2019s existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the Merger Transactions.\nThe Business Combination Agreement also restricts each of us and T-Mobile, without the other\u2019s consent, from taking certain actions outside of the ordinary course of business while the Merger Transactions are pending, including, among other things, certain acquisitions or dispositions of businesses and assets, entering into or amending certain contracts, repurchasing or issuing securities, making capital expenditures and incurring indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions. These restrictions may have a significant negative impact on our and T-Mobile\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, management and financial resources have been diverted and will continue to be diverted toward the completion of the Merger Transactions. We and T-Mobile have incurred, and expect to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger Transactions. These costs could adversely affect our and T-Mobile\u2019s financial condition and results of operations prior to the consummation of the Merger Transactions.\nThe Business Combination Agreement contains provisions that restrict the ability of our board of directors to pursue alternatives to the Merger Transactions.\nThe Business Combination Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that restrict our ability to solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making of, any proposal the consummation of which would constitute an alternative transaction for purposes of the Business Combination Agreement.\nOur directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger Transactions that may be different from, or in addition to, those of other of our stockholders.\nOur directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger Transactions that may differ from, or that are in addition to, the interests of our other stockholders. These interests with respect to our directors and executive officers may include, among others, continued service as a director or an executive officer of the combined company, employment or consulting arrangements, arrangements that provide for severance benefits if certain executive officers\u2019 employment is terminated under certain circumstances following the completion of the Merger Transactions and rights to indemnification and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance following the completion of the Merger Transactions. Our board of directors was aware of these interests during the time that the Business Combination Agreement was being negotiated and at the time they approved the Merger Transactions. These interests may cause our directors and executive officers to view the Merger Transactions differently than another stockholder may view.\nAlthough we expect that the Merger Transactions will result in synergies and other benefits to us and T-Mobile, those benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may not be realized within the expected time frame.\nOur and T-Mobile\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger Transactions will depend, to a large extent, on the combined company\u2019s ability to integrate our and T-Mobile\u2019s businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected stand-alone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by each company without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. In addition, some of the anticipated synergies are not expected to occur for a significant time period following the completion of the Merger Transactions and will require substantial capital expenditures in the near term to be fully realized. Even if the combined company is able to integrate the two companies successfully, the anticipated benefits of the Merger Transactions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nOur business and T-Mobile\u2019s business may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected. Operating costs, customer loss and business disruption, including difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, suppliers or vendors, may be greater than expected following the Merger Transactions. Revenues following the Merger Transactions may be lower than expected.\nThe combination of two independent businesses is complex, costly and time-consuming and may divert significant management attention and resources to combining our and T-Mobile\u2019s business practices and operations. This process may disrupt our and T-Mobile\u2019s businesses. The failure to meet the challenges involved in combining the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger Transactions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined company and could adversely affect the results of operations of the combined company. The overall combination of our and T-Mobile\u2019s businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and loss of customer and other business relationships. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the companies\u2019 operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems, including compliance by the combined company with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated by the SEC;\n\u2022\nchallenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures, accounting and other policies, business cultures, and compensation structures between the two companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel;\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated synergies, business opportunities, and growth prospects from the combination;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;\n\u2022\nthe transition of management to the combined company executive management team;\n\u2022\ndetermining whether and how to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the additional debt financing expected to be incurred in connection with the Merger Transactions;\n\u2022\ncontingent liabilities that are larger than expected; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences, and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the Merger Transactions.\nMany of these factors are outside of our and T-Mobile\u2019s control and/or will be outside the control of the combined company, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. In addition, even if the operations of our business and T-Mobile\u2019s business are combined successfully, the full benefits of the Merger Transactions may not be realized, including the synergies or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in combining our business and T-Mobile\u2019s business. All of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of the combined company, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger Transactions and negatively impact the price of our and T-Mobile\u2019s common stock. As a result, it cannot be assured that the combination of our business and T-Mobile\u2019s business will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the Merger Transactions within the anticipated time frames or at all.\nFailure to consummate the Merger Transactions could materially and adversely affect our future business and financial results.\nIf the Merger Transactions are not completed for any reason, our ongoing businesses may be materially and adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger Transactions, we will be subject to numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nhaving to pay substantial costs relating to the Merger Transactions, such as financing fees and costs and advisor, filing and other fees that will have already been incurred;\n\u2022\nexperiencing negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price or the trading price of our notes, on our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on acceptable terms or at all or from our customers, regulators and employees;\n\u2022\nfocusing on the Merger Transactions instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial, without realizing any of the benefits of having the Merger Transactions consummated; and\n\u2022\nreputational harm due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully consummate the Merger Transactions.\nThere can be no assurance that these risks will not materialize and will not materially affect our business, results of operation and financial condition if the Merger Transactions are not consummated.\nLitigation relating to the Merger Transactions may be filed against us or our board of directors and/or T-Mobile or the board of directors of T-Mobile that could prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger Transactions, result in the payment of damages following consummation of the Merger Transactions and/or have an adverse effect on the trading prices of our securities.\nIn connection with the Merger Transactions, Sprint and/or T-Mobile have, and may in the future, become subject to litigation, including putative class action lawsuits filed by stockholders against the boards of directors of Sprint and/or T-Mobile. Among other remedies, these legal actions could seek damages and/or to enjoin the Merger Transactions. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain and any such potential lawsuits could prevent or delay consummation of the Merger Transactions and/or result in substantial costs to us and/or T-Mobile. Any such actions may create uncertainty relating to the Merger Transactions and may be costly and distracting to management. Further, the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Merger Transactions are consummated may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Potential litigation relating to the Merger Transactions or the threat thereof may have an adverse effect on the trading prices of our securities.\nThe agreements governing the combined company\u2019s indebtedness will include restrictive covenants that limit the combined company\u2019s operating flexibility.\nThe agreements governing the combined company\u2019s indebtedness will impose material operating and financial restrictions on the combined company. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions and incurrence-based ratio tests, may limit the combined company\u2019s ability to engage in some transactions, including the following:\n\u2022\nincurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock;\n\u2022\npaying dividends, redeeming capital stock or making other restricted payments or investments;\n\u2022\nselling or buying assets, properties or licenses;\n\u2022\ndeveloping assets, properties or licenses which the combined company has or in the future may procure;\n\u2022\ncreating liens on assets;\n\u2022\nparticipating in future FCC auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum;\n\u2022\nengaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations, or other transactions;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nplacing restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments.\nThese restrictions could limit the combined company\u2019s ability to obtain debt financing, repurchase stock, refinance or pay principal on its outstanding indebtedness, complete acquisitions for cash or indebtedness or react to changes in its operating environment or the economy. Any future indebtedness that the combined company incurs may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the combined company\u2019s debt agreements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these agreements and other agreements, giving the combined company\u2019s lenders the right to terminate any commitments they had made to provide it with further funds and to require the combined company to repay all amounts then outstanding.\nFinancing of the Merger Transactions is not assured.\nAlthough T-Mobile USA has received debt financing commitments from lenders to provide various bridge and other credit facilities to finance the Merger Transactions, the obligation of the lenders to provide these facilities is subject to a number of conditions. It is also expected that T-Mobile will enter into other financing arrangements in connection with the Merger Transactions for which it does not presently have commitments. Furthermore, T-Mobile USA may seek to modify its existing financing arrangements in connection with the Merger Transactions. Accordingly, financing of the Merger Transactions is not assured. Even if T-Mobile USA is able to obtain financing or modify its existing financing arrangements, the terms of such new or modified financing arrangements may not be available to T-Mobile USA on favorable terms, and T-Mobile USA may incur significant costs in connection with entering into such financing. Furthermore, if T-Mobile is unable to obtain financing for the Merger Transactions on terms it finds acceptable or at all, it may have to exercise some or all of the commitments under its bridge financing facilities, in which event the costs of financing for the Merger Transactions may be higher than expected.\nDowngrades of our and/or T-Mobile\u2019s credit ratings could adversely affect our, T-Mobile\u2019s and/or the combined company\u2019s respective businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nOur credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings, and, as a result, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect each rating organization\u2019s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or, following completion of the Merger Transactions, obligations to the combined company\u2019s creditors. Each of the rating organizations reviews our ratings and T-Mobile\u2019s ratings periodically, and there can be no assurance that our or T-Mobile\u2019s current ratings will be maintained in the future. Downgrades in our financial health or ratings and/or T-Mobile\u2019s ratings could adversely affect our, T-Mobile\u2019s and/or the combined company\u2019s businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating results. The Business Combination Agreement also contains certain conditions relating to a minimum credit rating of T-Mobile USA on the closing date of the Merger Transactions.\nThe combined company\u2019s indebtedness following the completion of the Merger Transactions will be substantially greater than our indebtedness on a stand-alone basis and greater than the combined indebtedness of us and T-Mobile prior to the announcement of the Merger Transactions. This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business flexibility, and increase its borrowing costs.\nIn connection with the Merger Transactions, we expect T-Mobile to incur merger-related debt financing, which we expect will be used in part to prepay a portion of our existing indebtedness and a portion of T-Mobile\u2019s existing indebtedness and to fund liquidity needs. As a result, after giving effect to the Merger Transactions and the related transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, including the incurrence of the merger-related debt financing, we anticipate that the combined company will have substantially higher consolidated indebtedness.\nThe combined company\u2019s substantially increased indebtedness following completion of the Merger Transactions in comparison to our indebtedness prior to the Merger Transactions will have the effect, among other things, of reducing its flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. In addition, the amount of cash required to pay interest on the combined company\u2019s increased indebtedness levels will increase following the completion of the Merger Transactions, and thus the demands on cash resources will be greater than prior to the Merger Transactions. The increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the Merger Transactions may reduce funds available to fund the combined company\u2019s efforts to combine our business with T-Mobile\u2019s business and realize the expected benefits of the Merger Transactions and/or may also reduce funds available for capital expenditures, share repurchases, and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for the combined company relative to other companies with lower debt levels.\nFurther, it may be necessary to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future after the Merger Transactions subject to the restrictions contained in the combined company\u2019s debt instruments. If new indebtedness is added after the closing of the Merger Transactions, the related risks could intensify.\nBecause of the combined company\u2019s substantial indebtedness following the completion of the Merger Transactions, it may not be able to service its debt obligations in accordance with their terms after the Merger Transactions.\nThe combined company\u2019s ability to service its substantial debt obligations following the completion of the Merger Transactions will depend on its future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including its ability to achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the Merger Transactions. There is no guarantee that the combined company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay its debt service obligations when due. If the combined company is unable to meet its debt service obligations after the Merger Transactions or it fails to comply with its financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing its indebtedness, the combined company may be required to refinance all or part of its debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices or borrow more money. The combined company may not be able to, at any given time, refinance its debt, sell assets or borrow more money on acceptable terms or at all. The combined company\u2019s inability to refinance its debt could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the combined company after the Merger Transactions and will exercise less influence over management.\nUpon completion of the Merger Transactions, each of our stockholders who receives shares of T-Mobile common stock will become a stockholder of T-Mobile with a percentage ownership of T-Mobile that is smaller than their current percentage ownership of us. As a result, even if all of our former stockholders voted together on all matters presented to T-Mobile stockholders from time to time, our former stockholders would exercise significantly less influence over the combined company after the completion of the Merger Transactions relative to their influence over us now, and thus would have a less significant impact on the election of the combined company\u2019s board and on the approval or rejection of future proposals submitted to a stockholder vote of the combined company\u2019s stockholders.\nBusiness Risks\nIf we are not able to retain and attract profitable wireless subscribers, our financial performance will be impaired.\nOur success is based on our ability to retain current subscribers and attract new subscribers. If we are unable to attract and retain profitable wireless subscribers, our financial performance will be impaired, and we could fail to meet our financial obligations. We have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining profitable wireless customers. For example, our postpaid churn rate has increased nearly twenty basis points since the beginning of fiscal year 2018; this churn rate is the highest among major carriers and almost double that of AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. Furthermore, from January 1, 2008 through March 31, 2019, we have experienced an aggregate net decrease of approximately 9.9 million subscribers in our total retail postpaid subscriber base.\nOur ability to retain our existing subscribers, to compete successfully for new subscribers, and reduce our churn rate depends on, among other things:\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including our successful execution of marketing, customer retention and sales strategies; the acceptance of our value proposition; service delivery and customer care activities, including new account set up and billing; and execution under credit and collection policies;\n\u2022\nactual or perceived quality and coverage of our network, including delivering a positive and consistent experience nationwide;\n\u2022\npublic perception about our brands and the Merger Transactions;\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate, develop, and deploy new or enhanced technologies, products and services that are attractive to existing or potential subscribers on a timely basis or at all, including 5G technologies;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to access spectrum and acquire additional spectrum capacity, including certain low-band and millimeter wave frequencies;\n\u2022\nour ability to grow revenues and stabilize our financial metrics; and\n\u2022\nour ability to have the scale necessary to successfully compete.\nA competitive nationwide wireless network requires significant fixed costs and continual investment. Many of our competitors have significant size and scale advantages that enable them to spread these fixed costs over significantly larger subscriber bases. If we are unable to maintain a sufficiently large subscriber base necessary to support the needs of a competitive nationwide wireless network and the associated high costs, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Increased churn would further exacerbate this risk in the 5G era as we continue to make significant investments in our existing network for 5G.\nOur ability to retain subscribers may be negatively affected by industry trends related to subscriber contracts. We continue to see aggressive customer acquisition efforts by our competitors. For example, most service providers, including us, are offering wireless service plans without any long-term commitment and wireless service plans or devices with promotional pricing terms, such as buy one device, get one free and discounted lines for new qualifying customers. Furthermore, some service providers are reimbursing contract termination fees, including paying off the outstanding balance on devices, incurred by new customers in connection with such customers terminating service with their current wireless service providers. Aggressive promotional activities such as those described above could continue to negatively affect our ability to retain subscribers and could lead to a further increase in our churn rates if we are not successful in providing an attractive product, price and service mix, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the loss of customers upon expiration of their promotional pricing plans could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe expect to continue to incur expenses such as the reimbursement of subscriber termination fees and other subscriber acquisition and retention expenses to attract and retain subscribers, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will generate new subscribers or result in a lower churn rate. Subscriber losses and a high churn rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations because they result in lost revenues and cash flow.\nMoreover, we and our competitors continue to gain a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other\u2019s existing subscriber bases rather than from first-time purchasers. To the extent we cannot compete effectively for new subscribers or if we attract more subscribers that are not creditworthy, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe success of our network improvements and 5G deployment will depend on the timing, extent and cost of implementation; availability of financial resources; access to additional spectrum, including low-band frequencies; the performance of third-parties; upgrade requirements; and the availability and reliability of the various technologies required to provide such modernization.\nWe must continually invest in our wireless network, including expanding our network capacity and coverage through macro sites and small cells, in order to improve our wireless services and remain competitive by providing 5G capabilities. The development and deployment of new technologies and services requires us to anticipate the changing demands of our customers and to respond accordingly, which we may not be able to do in a timely or efficient manner.\nImprovements in our service depend on many factors, including our ability to predict and adapt to future changes in technologies, changes in consumer demands, changes in pricing and service offerings by our competitors and continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum, including any leased spectrum. If we are unable to access or acquire additional spectrum to increase capacity or to deploy the services subscribers desire on a timely basis or at acceptable costs while maintaining network quality levels, our ability to attract and retain subscribers could be adversely affected, which would negatively impact our operating results. If the Merger Transactions are not completed, our ability to provide a nationwide 5G network capable of competing effectively with other competitors in the wireless industry will depend on our access to, and deployment of, adequate low-band spectrum that we do not currently have and that we may not be able to obtain in the future on a timely basis given the lack of low-band spectrum available for purchase, or at acceptable costs. Accordingly, we likely will be unable to access sufficient low-band spectrum as a standalone company, which would limit the scope of our 5G services to certain geographic areas only and which likely would cause our 5G services to suffer from inconsistent network performance.\nIf we fail to provide a competitive network, which includes delivering a positive and consistent network experience nationwide, our ability to provide wireless services to our subscribers, to attract and retain subscribers, and to maintain and grow our subscriber revenues could be adversely affected. For instance, we will need to acquire additional spectrum to remain competitive and grow our subscriber base, meet increasing customer demands, and deploy a nationwide 5G network.\nUsing new and sophisticated technologies on a very large scale entails risks. For example, deployment of new technologies, such as 5G, from time to time has adversely affected, and in the future may adversely affect, the performance of existing services on our network and result in increased churn or failure to attract wireless subscribers. Should implementation of our network upgrades, including 5G, fail, be delayed or result in incurring costs in excess of expected amounts, our margins could be adversely affected and such effects could be material. Should the delivery of services expected to be deployed on our network be delayed due to technological constraints or changes, performance of third-party suppliers, regulatory restrictions, including zoning and leasing restrictions, or permit issues, subscriber dissatisfaction, or other reasons, the cost of providing such services could become higher than expected, ultimately increasing our cost to subscribers and resulting in decreases in net subscribers or our margins, or both, which would adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and cash flow from operations.\nIn addition, as a standalone company, we may lack the financial resources necessary to provide a robust,\nnationwide 5G network capable of competing effectively with other competitors in the wireless industry and other companies that have more recently begun providing wireless services, many of which have greater financial resources than we do. Accordingly, if the Merger Transactions are not completed, it is expected that we will not be able to deploy a nationwide 5G network on the same scale and on the same timeline as the combined company or on a scale and timeline that will allow us to compete effectively with our competitors, and therefore will continue to be limited in our ability to compete effectively in the 5G era. Further, it is expected that if the Merger Transactions are not completed, we will continue to lack the network, scale and financial resources of other competitors in, and other companies that have more recently begun providing, wireless services.\nOur high debt levels and restrictive debt covenants could negatively impact our ability to access future financing at attractive rates or at all, which could limit our operating flexibility and ability to repay our outstanding debt as it matures.\nAs of March 31, 2019, our consolidated principal amount of indebtedness was $40.3 billion. Our high debt levels and debt service requirements are significant in relation to our declining revenues and negative free cash flow, which may reduce our ability to respond to competition and economic trends in our industry or in the economy generally. Our high debt levels, including aggregate debt maturities of almost $28 billion over the next five fiscal years, may have an adverse effect on our business by reducing cash available for operations and further place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors. Our high debt levels and debt service requirements may also limit our financing options, including as a result of\nmarket sentiment and the restrictions placed on certain of our assets in our financing transactions. In addition, certain agreements governing our indebtedness impose operating restrictions on us, subject to exceptions, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make certain investments;\n\u2022\nreceive dividend or other payments from certain of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nengage in certain asset sale or business combination transactions.\nOur secured revolving bank credit facility and other financing facilities also require that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage ratio, which could limit our ability to incur additional debt. Our failure to comply with our debt covenants would trigger defaults under those obligations, which could result in the maturities of those debt obligations being accelerated and could in turn result in cross defaults with other debt obligations. If we are forced to refinance our debt obligations prior to maturity on terms that are less favorable or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, our asset-backed financings could subject us to an increased risk of loss of assets secured under those facilities. We continue to expect to rely on asset-backed financings as a source of funds, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so. For instance, although we have leveraged certain of our spectrum assets as collateral in asset-backed financing transactions, certain limitations such as our leasing arrangements on 2.5 GHz spectrum may significantly reduce our ability to further leverage our spectrum. In addition, the Business Combination Agreement restricts us, without T-Mobile's consent, from taking certain actions outside the ordinary course of business while the Merger Transactions are pending, including incurring certain indebtedness, which such restriction could put us at a disadvantage should the Merger Transactions not be consummated. Limitations on our ability to obtain suitable financing when needed could result in an inability to continue to expand our business, timely execute network plans, and meet competitive challenges.\nSubscribers who purchase on a financing basis or lease a device are not required to sign a fixed-term service contract, which could result in higher churn and higher bad debt expense.\nOur service plans allow certain subscribers to purchase or finance the use of an eligible device under an installment contract payable generally over a period of 24 months or to lease an eligible device for 18 months, as opposed to a traditional subsidy plan. Subscribers who take advantage of these plans are not required to sign a fixed-term service contract to obtain postpaid service; rather, their service is provided on a month-to-month basis with no early termination fee. These service plans may not meet our subscribers\u2019 or potential subscribers\u2019 needs, expectations, or demands. In addition, subscribers on these plans can discontinue their service at any time without penalty, other than the obligation of any residual commitment they may have for unpaid service, for amounts due under the installment contract or remaining lease payments for the device. We could experience a higher churn rate than we expect due to the ability of subscribers to more easily change service providers, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our operational and financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our customer base and achieve the customer penetration levels that we anticipate with this business model.\nBecause our lease and installment billing contracts permit customers to use or pay for devices over time, we maintain a certain level of debt to support our investment in these contracts. We fund our customer device financing activities through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from monetizing customer receivables. If a customer discontinues their\nservice, we are unable to support our investment in the associated device through debt, which will therefore require more cash on hand.\nIn addition, subscribers who have financed their devices through installment billing plans have the option to pay for their devices in installments generally over a period of up to 24 months. This program subjects us to increased risks relating to consumer credit issues, which could result in increased costs, including increases to our bad debt expense and write-offs of installment billing receivables. These arrangements may be particularly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, and any declines in the credit quality of our subscriber base could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur device leasing program exposes us to risks, including those related to the actual residual value realized on returned devices, higher churn and increased losses on devices.\nWe lease devices to certain of our subscribers. Our financial condition and results of operations depend, in part, on our ability to appropriately assess the credit risk of our lease subscribers and the ability of our lease subscribers to perform\nunder our device leases. In addition to monthly lease payments, we expect to realize economic benefit from the estimated residual value of a leased device, which is the estimated value of a leased device at the time of the expiration of the lease term. Changes in residual value assumptions made at lease inception affect the amount of depreciation expense and the net amount of equipment under operating leases. If estimated residual values, in the aggregate, significantly decline due to economic factors, obsolescence, or other circumstances, we may not realize such residual value, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We have suffered and may continue to suffer negative consequences including increased costs and increased losses on devices as a result of a lease subscriber default, the related termination of a lease, and the attempted repossession of the device, including failure of a lease subscriber to return a leased device. Sustained failure of subscribers to return leased devices could also negatively impact our ability to obtain financing based on leased devices in the future. In addition, subscribers who lease a device are not required to sign a fixed-term service contract, which could result in higher churn, and increased losses on devices.\nAdverse economic conditions may negatively impact our business and financial performance, as well as our access to financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur business and financial performance are sensitive to changes in macro-economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, inflation rates (or concerns about deflation), unemployment rates, energy costs, and other factors. Concerns about these and other factors, including the impact of the Merger Transactions on our business, may contribute to market volatility and economic uncertainty.\nMarket turbulence and weak economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance in a number of ways. Our services and device financing plans are available to a broad customer base, a significant portion of which may be more vulnerable to weak economic conditions, particularly our subprime customers. We may have greater difficulty in gaining new subscribers within this segment and existing subscribers may be more likely to terminate or select a lower cost service and default on device financing plans due to an inability to pay.\nWe will need to maintain lower costs and raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and execute our business strategy. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. Instability in the global financial markets has resulted in periodic volatility in the credit, equity, and fixed income markets. This volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nWeak economic conditions and credit conditions may also adversely impact various third parties on which we rely, some of which have filed for or may be considering bankruptcy, experiencing cash flow or liquidity problems, or are unable to obtain credit such that they may no longer be able to operate. Any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services.\nGovernment regulation could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations; federal and state regulatory commissions may adopt new regulations or take other actions that could adversely affect our business prospects, future growth, or results of operations.\nThe FCC, FTC, CFPB, and other federal, state and local, as well as international, governmental authorities assert jurisdiction over our business and could adopt regulations or policies or take other actions that would adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations.\nThe licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, international, state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation. There is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed. Failure to comply with the FCC requirements applicable to a given license could result in revocation of that license and, depending on the nature of the non-compliance, other Sprint licenses.\nThe FCC uses its transactional \"spectrum screen\" to identify prospective wireless transactions that may require additional competitive scrutiny. If a proposed transaction would exceed the spectrum screen threshold, the FCC undertakes a more detailed analysis of relevant market conditions in the impacted geographic areas to determine whether the transaction would reduce competition without offsetting public benefits. The screen includes substantial portions of the 2.5 GHz band previously excluded from the screen and that are licensed or leased to Sprint in numerous markets. As a result, future Sprint spectrum acquisitions may exceed the spectrum screen trigger for additional FCC review. Such additional review could\nextend the duration of the regulatory review process and there can be no assurance that such transactions will ultimately be completed in whole or in part.\nOver the past several years, the FCC and other federal and state agencies have engaged in increased regulatory and enforcement activity as well as investigations of the industry generally. Enforcement activities or investigations could make it more difficult and expensive to operate our business, and could increase the costs of our wireless operations. In addition, we may offer products that include highly regulated financial services, which subject us to additional state and federal regulations. The costs to comply with such regulations and failure to remain compliant with such regulations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDegradation in network performance caused by compliance with government regulation, loss of spectrum, or additional rules associated with the use of spectrum in any market could result in an inability to attract new subscribers or higher subscriber churn in that market, which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Furthermore, additional costs or fees imposed by governmental regulation could adversely affect our revenues, future growth, and results of operations.\nOn December 14, 2017, the FCC voted to return broadband Internet access service to its prior classification as an information service, and reinstate the private mobile service classification of mobile broadband Internet access service. The order also eliminated the FCC's Internet Conduct Standard, along with the bright-line rules and included expanded transparency requirements. The new rules were published in the federal register on February 22, 2018. The 2017 FCC order has been challenged by various groups, including certain state attorneys general, and has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In addition, as a result of the 2017 FCC order, state legislators have introduced, and in some cases passed, state laws requiring different levels of adherence to net neutrality principles for broadband Internet access service providers active in the applicable states. In addition, several governors have issued executive orders similarly addressing net neutrality. Depending on the interpretation and application of these rules, including the outcome of the appeal of the 2017 FCC order, other legal challenges to the order and conflicts between federal and state laws and executive orders, we may incur additional costs or be limited in the services we can provide which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe financing of devices through leasing and installment billing has increased our regulatory exposure, including\nwith respect to consumer complaints and potential examinations or enforcement actions by federal and state regulatory\nagencies, including the CFPB, state attorneys general, the FCC and the FTC. We may also be subject to potential regulatory\nfines, penalties, enforcement actions, and litigation. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and our financial condition.\nVarious federal, state and international governmental authorities have adopted or are considering laws or\nregulations related to privacy and data protection, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect in May 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which takes effect in 2020. Enactment of new privacy laws or regulations could, among other things, result in additional costs of compliance or litigation. In addition, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to significant penalties for non-compliance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe recruit professionals, including senior management, on a global basis to work in the U.S. and, therefore, must comply with the U.S. immigration and work permit/visa laws and regulations. An inability to obtain sufficient work permits/visas due to the impact of these regulations, including any changes to immigration and work permit/visa regulations in the U.S., could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with the products and services we sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and\nlocal taxes and fees to the respective governmental authorities. Tax laws are subject to change and interpretation. In the event\nthat we are found to have incorrectly calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we\ncould be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions, which could materially impact our business,\nresults of operations and our financial condition. For risks related to governmental regulation in connection with the Merger Transactions, see \"- Risks Relating to the Merger Transactions.\"\nCompetition, industry consolidation, effectiveness of our cost optimization efforts, and technological changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our operations, resulting in adverse effects on our revenues, cash flows, growth, and profitability.\nWe compete with a number of other wireless service providers, many of which have greater financial resources than we do. Competition is expected to continue to increase as additional spectrum is made available for commercial wireless services and as additional communications, cable, and technology companies begin providing wireless services. In addition,\nwe have experienced and expect to continue to experience an increased customer demand for data usage on our network. Competition in pricing, service, and product offerings may adversely impact subscriber retention and our ability to attract new subscribers. A decline in the average revenue per subscriber coupled with a decline in the number of subscribers would negatively impact our revenues, cash flows, and profitability.\nIn addition, consolidation by our competitors and roaming partners could lead to fewer companies controlling access to network infrastructure, enabling our competitors to control usage and rates, which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability. The two largest national wireless communication providers serve a significant percentage of all\nwireless subscribers and hold substantial spectrum and other resources. Our largest competitors may be able to enter into\nexclusive handset, device, or content arrangements, as well as execute widespread advertising and marketing campaigns. In\naddition, refusal of our largest competitors to provide access to critical resources, such as roaming services on reasonable\nterms, could improve our largest competitors\u2019 position within the industry.\nThe wireless industry also faces competition from other communications, cable, and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. Further, some of our current competitors now provide content services in addition to voice and broadband services, and consumers are increasingly accessing video content from alternative sources via Internet-based providers and applications, all of which create increased competition in this area. For\ninstance, AT&T recently completed its acquisition of Time Warner, Inc. after it acquired DirecTV. In addition, Verizon has\nacquired AOL, Inc. and Yahoo! Inc.\nThe wireless communications industry continues to experience significant technological change, including improvements in the capacity, quality, security and types of technology. These developments cause uncertainty about future subscriber demand for our wireless services and the prices that we will be able to charge for these services. As services, technology, and devices evolve, we also expect continued pressure on voice, text, data and other service revenues. Rapid changes in technology may lead to the development of wireless communications technologies, products, or alternative services that are superior to our technologies, products, or services, or that consumers prefer over ours. In addition, technological advances have caused long distance, local, wireless, video, and Internet services to become more integrated, which has contributed to increased competition, new competitors, new products, and the expansion of services offered by our competitors in each of these markets. If we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis, or at an acceptable cost, we may not be able to compete effectively and could lose subscribers to our competitors.\nWe believe that the ability to provide nationwide 5G services will be a critical driver of competition as wireless\ntechnologies evolve from current-generation 4G services to next-generation 5G services, and significant competitive\nadvantages are expected to result from being \u201cfirst-to-market\u201d with nationwide 5G services. The failure to develop and launch a successful nationwide 5G network could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a 5G network could result in us not being among the \u201cfirst-to-market,\u201d which could further compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOver the past several years, we have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating costs across all functions\nof the Company. As a result of these cost-cutting initiatives, we have a more limited ability to further reduce costs should such measures become necessary. In addition, any further reductions may have a materially negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile and may not reflect our actual operations and performance.\nMarket and industry factors may impact the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operations and performance. Stock price volatility and sustained decreases in our share price could subject our stockholders to losses and may adversely impact our ability to issue equity. The trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nuncertainties related to our proposed merger with T-Mobile;\n\u2022\ninformation about the Merger Transactions;\n\u2022\nour actual or anticipated financial results;\n\u2022\nmarket and pricing risks due to concentrated ownership of our stock;\n\u2022\nthe ability to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional debt or equity or otherwise, including the cost and availability or perceived availability of additional capital;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors or market speculation of acquisitions, spectrum acquisitions, new products, technologies, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nthe performance of SoftBank and SoftBank\u2019s ordinary shares or speculation about the possibility of future actions SoftBank may take;\n\u2022\ndisruption to our operations or those of other companies critical to our network operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and market new and enhanced technologies, products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis, including any network improvement efforts and the deployment of 5G;\n\u2022\nrecommendations by securities analysts or changes in their estimates concerning us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the ratings of our debt by rating agencies;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental actions, regulations, or approvals; and\n\u2022\nperceptions of general market conditions in the technology and communications industries, the U.S. economy, and global market conditions.\nWe have entered into, or may enter into, agreements with various parties for certain business operations. Any difficulties experienced by us in these arrangements could result in additional expense, loss of subscribers and revenue, interruption of our services, or a failure or delay in the roll-out of new technology.\nWe have entered into, and may in the future enter into, agreements with various third parties for the day-to-day execution of services, provisioning, maintenance, and upgrading of our wireless and wireline networks, including the permitting, building, and installation of network upgrades; leases and subleases for space on communications towers; the development and maintenance of certain systems necessary for the operation of our business; customer service, related support to our wireless subscribers, outsourcing aspects of our wireline network and back office functions; and to provide network equipment, handsets, devices, and other equipment. For example, we depend heavily on local access facilities obtained from ILECs to serve our data and voice subscribers, and payments to ILECs for these facilities are a significant cost of service for both our Wireless and Wireline segments. We also expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as more advanced technologies are developed, which may lead to additional significant costs. If our key vendors fail to meet their contractual obligations or experience financial difficulty, or if we fail to adequately diversify our reliance among vendors, we may experience disruptions to our business operations or incur significant costs implementing alternative arrangements.\nWe may not be able to protect the intellectual property rights upon which we rely, or the products and services utilized by us and our suppliers and service providers may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others.\nWe rely on various patent, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish\nand protect our proprietary rights. Despite these actions, they only offer limited protection and may not prevent the\nmisappropriation of our rights. Also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of or protect against any\nunauthorized use of our proprietary rights, which may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. Any\nof these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We also purchase products from suppliers, including device suppliers, and outsource services to service providers, including billing and customer care functions, that incorporate or utilize intellectual property. We and some of our suppliers and service providers have received, and may receive in the future, assertions and claims from third parties that the products or software utilized by us or our suppliers and service providers infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of these third parties. These claims could require us or an infringing supplier or service provider to cease certain activities or to cease selling the relevant products and services. These claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management resources. If these claims are successful, we could be forced to pay significant damages or stop selling certain products or services or stop using certain trademarks, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nNegative outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are regularly involved in a number of legal proceedings before various state and federal courts, the FCC, the FTC, the CFPB, and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. These proceedings may be complicated, costly, and disruptive to our business operations. We may incur significant expenses in defending these matters and may be required to pay significant fines, awards, or settlements. In addition, litigation or other proceedings could result in restrictions on our current or future manner of doing business. Any of these potential outcomes, such as judgments, awards, settlements, or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or ability to do business.\nFor a discussion of litigation risks related to the Merger Transactions, see \"- Risks Relating to the Merger Transactions.\"\nOur reputation and business may be harmed and we may be subject to legal claims if there is a loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, unauthorized access to, or other security breach of our proprietary or sensitive information. Any disruption of our business operations due to a cyber attack, even for a limited amount of time, may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur information technology and other systems-including those of our third-party service providers-that maintain and transmit our proprietary information, the confidential information of our business partners and our employees, and our subscribers\u2019 information, including credit card information, location data, or other personal information, may be compromised by a malicious third-party penetration of our network security, including by state-sponsored parties, or company employees or external actors, and impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees and agents. As a result, our proprietary or confidential information or the proprietary or confidential information of our business partners, employees and subscribers may be lost, disclosed, accessed, used, corrupted, destroyed, or taken without consent. Cyber attacks, such as the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of service attacks, or other means for disruption or unauthorized access, and data breaches have increased in frequency, scope, and potential harm in recent years. Cyber attacks may occur in conjunction with physical attacks on our network infrastructure. We also purchase equipment and software from third parties that could contain software defects, Trojan horses, malware, or other means by which third parties could access our network or the information stored or transmitted on such network or equipment.\nWhile to date we are not aware of any cyber attacks or other cyber incidents that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology and networks may be insufficient to repel a cyber attack in the future. In addition, the costs of such preventative actions, including insurance coverage that we maintain relating to cybersecurity incidents, may be significant, which may adversely affect our results of operations. Any disruption of the information\ntechnology systems that are necessary to conducting normal business operations due to a cyber attack, even for a limited\namount of time, may prevent us from conducting normal business operations and adversely affect our financial condition. Any major compromise of our data or network security or that of our third-party service suppliers, failure to prevent or mitigate a loss of our services or network, our proprietary information, or our subscribers\u2019 information, and delays in detecting any such compromise or loss, even for a limited amount of time, could disrupt our operations, impact our reputation and subscribers\u2019 willingness to purchase our service, and subject us to significant additional expenses. Such expenses could include incentives offered to existing subscribers and other business relationships in order to retain their business, increased expenditures on cyber security measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption, significant penalties under privacy laws, and litigation, which could be material. Furthermore, the potential costs associated with any such cyber attacks could be greater than the insurance coverage we maintain.\nEquipment failure, natural disasters or terrorist acts may affect our infrastructure and result in significant disruption to\nour business.\nMajor equipment failures, natural disasters, including severe weather, terrorist acts or other disruptions that affect our wireline and wireless networks, including transport facilities, communications switches, routers, microwave links, cell sites, or other equipment or third-party owned local and long-distance networks on which we rely, could disrupt our operations, require significant resources to remedy, result in a loss of subscribers or impair our ability to attract new subscribers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to improve our results of operations and as we continue to upgrade our networks, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our long-lived assets, goodwill, or other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nAs a result of the SoftBank Merger, Sprint recognized goodwill at its acquisition-date estimate of fair value of approximately $6.6 billion, which has been entirely allocated to the wireless segment. Since goodwill was reflected at its estimate of fair value, there was no excess fair value over book value as of the date of the close of the SoftBank Merger. Additionally, we recorded $14.6 billion and $41.7 billion of long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively, as of the close of the SoftBank Merger. We evaluate the carrying value of our indefinite-lived assets, including goodwill, at least annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired, or in the case of goodwill, that the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying amount. As a result of our evaluation, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2.0 billion related to goodwill in our wireless reporting unit during the year ended March 31, 2019. Continued, sustained declines in the Company\u2019s operating results, the number of wireless\nsubscribers, future forecasted cash flows, growth rates and other assumptions, as well as significant, sustained declines in the Company\u2019s stock price and related market capitalization could impact the underlying key assumptions and our estimated fair values, potentially leading to a future material impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill, or other indefinite-lived assets, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, as we continue to refine our network strategy, management may conclude, in future periods, that certain equipment assets in use will not be utilized as long as originally intended, which could result in an acceleration of depreciation expense. Moreover, certain equipment assets may never be deployed or redeployed, in which case cash and/or non-cash charges that could be material to our consolidated financial statements would be recognized.\nAny acquisitions, strategic investments, or mergers may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business.\nAlthough we are focused on taking the steps necessary to close the Merger Transactions, we may still, from time to time, evaluate potential acquisitions, strategic investments, and mergers, and we may engage in discussions with potential counterparties. Some of these potential transactions could be significant relative to the size of our business and operations. Any such acquisitions would involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges.\nAs a result, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment, or merger may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. For more information on the Merger Transactions, see \"- Risks Relating to the Merger Transactions.\"\nControlled Company Risks\nAs long as SoftBank controls us, other holders of our common stock will have limited ability to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and SoftBank\u2019s interest may conflict with ours and our other stockholders.\nAs of March 31, 2019, SoftBank beneficially owned nearly 85% of the outstanding common stock of Sprint. As a result, until such time as SoftBank and its controlled affiliates hold shares representing less than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of our outstanding common stock at a stockholder meeting, SoftBank generally will have the ability to control the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of our stockholders, except in certain circumstances set forth in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws. For example, SoftBank was able to approve the Merger Transactions.\nSo long as SoftBank and its controlled affiliates hold shares of our common stock representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of our common stock at a stockholder meeting, SoftBank will be able to freely nominate and elect all the members of our board of directors, subject only to a requirement that a certain number of directors qualify as \"Independent Directors,\" as such term is defined in the NYSE listing rules and applicable laws. The directors elected by SoftBank will have the authority to make decisions affecting the capital structure of the Company, including the issuance of additional equity, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the implementation of stock repurchase programs, and the declaration of dividends.\nThe interests of SoftBank may not coincide with the interests of our other stockholders or with holders of our indebtedness. SoftBank\u2019s ability, subject to the limitations in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval limits the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders or holders of our indebtedness do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our common stock or terms upon which we issue indebtedness could be adversely affected. In addition, the existence of a controlling stockholder may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or discouraging a third-party from seeking to acquire, the Company. For example, T-Mobile was required to negotiate the Merger Transactions with SoftBank. The interests of SoftBank with respect to such transactions may be different from the interests of our other stockholders or with holders of our indebtedness. See \"- Risks Relating to the Merger Transactions\" for more information. In addition, the performance of SoftBank and SoftBank\u2019s ordinary shares or speculation about the possibility of future actions SoftBank may take may adversely affect our share price or the trading price of our debt securities.\nSubject to limitations in our certificate of incorporation that limit SoftBank\u2019s ability to engage in certain competing businesses in the U.S. or take advantage of certain corporate opportunities, SoftBank is not restricted from competing with us or otherwise taking for itself or its other affiliates certain corporate opportunities that may be attractive to the Company.\nSoftBank\u2019s ability to control our board of directors may make it difficult for us to recruit independent directors.\nFor so long as SoftBank and its controlled affiliates hold shares of our common stock representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of our common stock at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, SoftBank will be able\nto elect all of the members of our board of directors. Under these circumstances, persons who might otherwise accept an invitation to join our board of directors may decline.\nAny inability to resolve favorably any disputes that may arise between the Company and SoftBank or its affiliates may adversely affect our business.\nDisputes may arise between SoftBank or its affiliates and the Company in a number of areas, including:\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations involving the Company, including with respect to the Merger Transactions;\n\u2022\nsales or dispositions by SoftBank of all or any portion of its ownership interest in us;\n\u2022\nthe nature, quality and pricing of services SoftBank or its affiliates may agree to provide to the Company;\n\u2022\narrangements with third parties that are exclusionary to SoftBank or its affiliates or the Company; and\n\u2022\nbusiness opportunities that may be attractive to both SoftBank or its affiliates and the Company.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nWe are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not \"controlled companies.\"\nSoftBank owns more than 50% of the total voting power of our common shares and, accordingly, we have elected to be treated as a \"controlled company\" under the NYSE corporate governance standards. As a controlled company, we are exempt under the NYSE standards from the obligation to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u2022\na majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors;\n\u2022\nwe have a corporate governance and nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022\nwe have a Compensation Committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nan annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance committee and Compensation Committee be performed.\nAs a result of our use of the \"controlled company\" exemptions, holders of our common stock and debt securities may not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nRegulatory authorities have imposed measures to protect national security and classified projects as well as other conditions that could have an adverse effect on Sprint.\nAs a precondition to approval of the SoftBank Merger, certain U.S. government agencies required that SoftBank and Sprint enter into certain agreements, including the NSA, under which SoftBank and Sprint have agreed to implement certain measures to protect national security, certain of which may materially and adversely affect our operating results due to increasing the cost of compliance with security measures, and limiting our control over certain U.S. facilities, contracts, personnel, vendor selection, and operations. If we fail to comply with our obligations under the NSA or other agreements, our ability to operate our business may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 39087, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "S"}
