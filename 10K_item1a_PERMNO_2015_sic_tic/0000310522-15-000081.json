{"cik": "310522", "company": "FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION FANNIE MAE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRefer to \u201cMD&A-Risk Management\u201d for more detailed descriptions of the primary risks to our business and how we seek to manage those risks.\nThe risks we face could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our past results or the results contemplated by forward-looking statements contained in this report. However, these are not the only risks we face. In addition to the risks we discuss below, we face risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe future of our company is uncertain.\nThere continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the future of our company, including how long the company will continue to exist in its current form, the extent of our role in the market, what form we will have, and what ownership interest, if any, our current common and preferred stockholders will hold in us after the conservatorship is terminated and whether we will continue to exist following conservatorship. The conservatorship is indefinite in duration and the timing, conditions and likelihood of our emerging from conservatorship are uncertain. Termination of the conservatorship, other than in connection with a receivership, requires Treasury\u2019s consent under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement.\nIn 2011, the Administration released a report to Congress on ending the conservatorships of the GSEs and reforming America\u2019s housing finance market. The report provides that the Administration will work with FHFA to determine the best way to responsibly reduce Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s role in the market and ultimately wind down both institutions. The report also addresses three options for a reformed housing finance system. The report does not state whether or how the existing infrastructure or human capital of Fannie Mae may be used in the establishment of such a reformed system. The report emphasizes the importance of proceeding with a careful transition plan and providing the necessary financial support to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the transition period. In August 2013, the White House released a paper confirming that a core principle of the Administration\u2019s housing policy priorities is to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac through a responsible transition. In January 2015, the White House reaffirmed the Administration\u2019s view that housing finance reform should include ending Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s business model.\nIn the last Congress, members of Congress considered several bills to reform the housing finance system, including bills that, among other things, would require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be wound down after a period of time and place certain restrictions on Fannie Mae\u2019s and Freddie Mac\u2019s activities prior to being wound down. We expect that Congress will continue to hold hearings and consider legislation on the future status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including proposals that would result in Fannie Mae\u2019s liquidation or dissolution. Congress or FHFA may also consider legislation or regulation aimed at increasing the competition we face or reducing our market share. We cannot predict the prospects for the enactment, timing or final content of housing finance reform legislation. See \u201cBusiness-Housing Finance Reform\u201d for more information about the Administration\u2019s report and paper, and Congressional proposals regarding housing finance reform.\nOur dividend obligations on Treasury\u2019s investment result in our retaining a limited and decreasing amount of our net worth each year until 2018. Beginning in 2018, we will no longer retain any of our net worth.\nAs a result of the dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock and quarterly directives from our conservator, we are obligated to pay Treasury each quarter the amount, if any, by which our net worth as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeds an applicable capital reserve amount. This capital reserve amount is $1.8 billion for each quarterly dividend period in 2015 and decreases by $600 million annually until it reaches zero in 2018. Accordingly, our dividend obligations will result in our retaining a limited and decreasing amount of our net worth each year until 2018. Beginning in 2018, we will no longer retain any of our net worth, as the entire amount of our net worth at the end of each quarter will be required to be paid to Treasury.\nBecause we are permitted to retain only a limited and decreasing amount of capital reserves through 2017, we may not have sufficient reserves to avoid a net worth deficit if we experience a comprehensive loss in a future quarter. In addition, beginning in 2018, we are not permitted to retain any capital reserves against losses in subsequent quarters; therefore, if we have a comprehensive loss for a quarter we will also have a net worth deficit for that quarter. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience volatility in our financial results from period to period due to a number of factors, particularly changes in market conditions that result in fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the financial instruments, such as derivatives and certain securities, that we mark to market through our earnings. Our credit-related income or expense also can vary substantially from period to period primarily due to changes in home prices, borrower payment behavior and\neconomic conditions. In addition, as described in \u201cExecutive Summary-Outlook,\u201d we expect substantially lower earnings in future years than our earnings for 2014. Accordingly, although we expect to remain profitable on an annual basis for the foreseeable future, the expected volatility in our financial results, which may be significant from quarter to quarter, could result in a net worth deficit in a future quarter, particularly as our capital reserve approaches zero.\nFor any quarter for which we have a net worth deficit, we will be required to draw funds from Treasury under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement in order to avoid being placed into receivership. As of the date of this filing, the maximum amount of remaining funding under the agreement is $117.6 billion. If we were to draw additional funds from Treasury under the agreement in a future period, the amount of remaining funding under the agreement would be reduced by the amount of our draw. Dividend payments we make to Treasury do not restore or increase the amount of funding available to us under the agreement.\nOur regulator is authorized or required to place us into receivership under specified conditions, which would result in the liquidation of our assets. Amounts recovered from the liquidation may not be sufficient to repay the liquidation preference of any series of our preferred stock or to provide any proceeds to common shareholders.\nFHFA is required to place us into receivership if the Director of FHFA makes a written determination that our assets are less than our obligations for a period of 60 days after the filing deadline for our Form 10-K or Form 10-Q with the SEC. Although Treasury committed to providing us funds in accordance with the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, if we need funding from Treasury to avoid triggering FHFA\u2019s obligation, Treasury may not be able to provide sufficient funds to us within the required 60 days if it has exhausted its borrowing authority, if there is a government shutdown, or if the funding we need exceeds the amount available to us under the agreement. In addition, we could be put into receivership at the discretion of the Director of FHFA at any time for other reasons set forth in the GSE Act, including if we are critically undercapitalized or if we are undercapitalized and have no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized.\nA receivership would terminate the conservatorship. In addition to the powers FHFA has as our conservator, the appointment of FHFA as our receiver would terminate all rights and claims that our shareholders and creditors may have against our assets or under our charter arising from their status as shareholders or creditors, except for their right to payment, resolution or other satisfaction of their claims as permitted under the GSE Act. Unlike a conservatorship, the purpose of which is to conserve our assets and return us to a sound and solvent condition, the purpose of a receivership is to liquidate our assets and resolve claims against us.\nTo the extent we are placed into receivership and do not or cannot fulfill our guaranty to the holders of our Fannie Mae MBS, the MBS holders could become unsecured creditors of ours with respect to claims made under our guaranty, to the extent the mortgage collateral underlying the Fannie Mae MBS is insufficient to satisfy the claims of the MBS holders.\nIn the event of a liquidation of our assets, only after payment of the administrative expenses of the receiver and the immediately preceding conservator, the secured and unsecured claims against the company (including repaying all outstanding debt obligations), and the liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock, would any liquidation proceeds be available to repay the liquidation preference on any other series of preferred stock. Finally, only after the liquidation preference on all series of preferred stock is repaid would any liquidation proceeds be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock. We believe that in the event of a liquidation of our assets it is unlikely that there would be sufficient proceeds to make any distribution to holders of our preferred stock or common stock, other than to Treasury as a holder of our senior preferred stock.\nOur business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to retain and recruit well-qualified employees. The limitations on our employee compensation put us at a disadvantage compared to many other companies in attracting and retaining employees.\nOur business processes are highly dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees. The conservatorship, the uncertainty of our future, limitations on employee compensation and negative publicity concerning the GSEs have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on our ability to retain and recruit well-qualified employees. Turnover in key management positions and challenges in integrating new management could harm our ability to manage our business effectively and ultimately adversely affect our financial performance.\nActions taken by Congress, FHFA and Treasury to date, or that may be taken by them or other government agencies in the future, have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on the retention and recruitment of senior executives, management and other employees. We are subject to significant restrictions on the amount and type of compensation we may pay our executives and other employees under conservatorship. For example, in April 2012, the STOCK Act was enacted, which includes a provision that prohibits senior executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from receiving bonuses during any period of conservatorship on or after the date of enactment of the law. In addition, we are unable to offer equity-based\ncompensation. As a result, we have not been able to incent and reward excellent performance with compensation structures that provide upside potential to our executives, which places us at a disadvantage compared to many other companies in attracting and retaining executives.\nIn addition, the amount of compensation we pay our senior executives is significantly less than executives\u2019 compensation at many comparable companies. As discussed more fully in \u201cExecutive Compensation-Compensation Discussion and Analysis-Other Executive Compensation Considerations-Comparator Group and Role of Benchmark Data,\u201d our named executives\u2019 total target direct compensation under the 2014 executive compensation program in aggregate was substantially below the market median for comparable firms. Our Chief Executive Officer\u2019s annual total direct compensation is $600,000, which was more than 90% below the market median in 2014. While many of our executives have accepted below market compensation for the past several years, our inability to increase executive compensation to market levels for the foreseeable future puts us at greater risk of attrition, and also hampers our ability to recruit new executives. Moreover, our inability to offer market-based compensation makes succession planning very difficult, particularly for our Chief Executive Officer role.\nCongress has considered other legislation in the past that would alter the compensation for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac employees. In 2011, the Financial Services Committee of the House of Representatives approved a bill that would put our employees on a federal government pay scale. Although this legislation was not passed by the House or the Senate, if similar legislation were to become law, our employees could experience a sudden and sharp decrease in compensation, which would harm our ability to retain and recruit employees. In addition, the uncertainty of potential Congressional action with respect to housing finance reform, which may result in the wind-down of the company, negatively affects our ability to retain and recruit employees.\nWe face competition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside of the financial services industry for qualified employees. Additionally, an improving economy has put additional pressures on turnover, as attractive opportunities have become available to our employees. Our competitors for talent are generally not subject to the same limitations on employee compensation. The constraints on our compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract qualified candidates. While we engage in succession planning for our senior management and other critical positions and have been able to fill a number of important positions internally, our inability to offer market-based compensation may limit our ability to attract and retain qualified employees below the senior executive level that could fill our senior executive level positions if there is an increase in turnover.\nIf we are unable to retain, promote and attract employees with the necessary skills and talent, we would face increased risks for operational failures. If there were several high-level departures at approximately the same time, our ability to conduct our business and our results of operations would likely be materially adversely affected.\nOur business activities are significantly affected by the conservatorship and the senior preferred stock purchase agreement.\nWe are currently under the control of our conservator, FHFA, and we do not know when or how the conservatorship will terminate. As conservator, FHFA can direct us to enter into contracts or enter into contracts on our behalf, and generally has the power to transfer or sell any of our assets or liabilities. In addition, our directors do not have fiduciary duties to any person or entity except to the conservator. Accordingly, our directors are not obligated to consider the interests of the company, the holders of our equity or debt securities, or the holders of Fannie Mae MBS in making or approving a decision unless specifically directed to do so by the conservator.\nWe are subject to significant restrictions on our business activities during conservatorship. We may be prevented by our conservator from engaging in business activities or transactions that we believe would benefit our business and financial results. For example, we publish risk-based loan level price adjustment grids that specify the additional cash fees we charge at the time we initially acquire a loan based on the credit characteristics of the loan. These fees allow us to price appropriately for the credit risk we assume in providing our guaranty on the loans. We do not have the ability to implement changes to these pricing grids without the approval of FHFA. If the mix of our single-family loan acquisitions changes, and FHFA does not approve requested changes to our pricing grids in response to these changes, it could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nIn addition, we may be required by our conservator to engage in activities that are operationally difficult, costly to implement or unprofitable, or that may adversely affect our financial results or the credit risk profile of our book of business. For example, in 2014, FHFA requested that we reduce our retained mortgage portfolio each year to 90% of the amount permitted under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, which requires that we reduce our retained mortgage portfolio at a faster rate than previously required. This could result in the sale of assets at prices below the levels recorded in our financial statements or the sale of assets that may be more economical to hold, and will result in a faster decline in the revenues generated by our retained mortgage portfolio. In addition, as described in \u201cBusiness-Our Charter and Regulation of Our\nActivities-Potential Changes to Our Single-Family Guaranty Fee Pricing,\u201d FHFA announced in June 2014 that it was requesting public input on the guaranty fees that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac charge lenders, and FHFA is currently reviewing and considering the public input that was received. Based on its review, FHFA may direct us to make changes to our guaranty fee pricing that could materially affect our financial results. If FHFA directs us to decrease our guaranty fee pricing, depending on the extent of the decrease, it could result in a significant decrease in our guaranty fee revenues in future periods. If FHFA directs us to increase our guaranty fee pricing, depending on the extent of the increase, it could result in some of our lender customers retaining lower credit risk loans for their portfolio instead of delivering the loans to us. This could lead to a decrease in our single-family business volume, negatively affect the credit risk profile of our new single-family acquisitions and adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nBecause we are under the control of our conservator, our business objectives may not be consistent with the investment objectives of our investors. FHFA has changed our business objectives significantly since we entered conservatorship, and could make additional changes at any time. In May 2014, FHFA released its 2014 Strategic Plan for the Conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which replaced FHFA\u2019s strategic goals identified in 2012. Actions we take to meet FHFA\u2019s goals and objectives could adversely affect our financial results. For example, FHFA\u2019s 2014 and 2015 conservatorship scorecards include objectives relating to the development of a single common security for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We believe the development of a single common security would likely reduce, and could eliminate, the trading advantage Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities have over Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities. If this occurs, we believe it would negatively impact our ability to compete for mortgage assets in the secondary market, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations. Our objectives and business activities may continue to change, possibly significantly, including in pursuit of our public mission and other non-financial objectives. Significant changes in our business objectives could adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, we are devoting significant resources to meeting FHFA\u2019s goals for our conservatorship and expect to continue to do so.\nThe senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury includes a number of covenants that significantly restrict our business activities. We cannot, without the prior written consent of Treasury: pay dividends (except on the senior preferred stock); sell, issue, purchase or redeem Fannie Mae equity securities; sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of assets in specified situations; engage in transactions with affiliates other than on arm\u2019s-length terms or in the ordinary course of business; issue subordinated debt; or incur indebtedness that would result in our aggregate indebtedness exceeding 120% of the amount of mortgage assets we are allowed to own under the agreement. In deciding whether to consent to any request for approval it receives from us under the agreement, Treasury has the right to withhold its consent for any reason and is not required by the agreement to consider any particular factors, including whether or not management believes that the transaction would benefit the company. Pursuant to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, the maximum allowable amount of mortgage assets we were permitted to own as of December 31, 2014 was $469.6 billion, and on each December 31 thereafter, our mortgage assets may not exceed 85% of the maximum allowable amount that we were permitted to own as of December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year until the amount of our mortgage assets reaches $250 billion. In addition, as described above, FHFA has requested that we further cap our mortgage assets each year at 90% of the annual limit under our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury.\nActions taken by the conservator and the restrictions set forth in the senior preferred stock purchase agreement could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nA number of lawsuits have been filed against the U.S. government relating to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement and the conservatorship. See \u201cNote 19, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for a description of these lawsuits. We cannot predict the course or the outcome of these lawsuits, or the actions the U.S. government (including Treasury or FHFA) may take in response to any ruling or finding in any of these lawsuits. Accordingly, we cannot predict what impact, if any, these lawsuits will have on our business.\nThe conservatorship and investment by Treasury have had, and will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our common and preferred shareholders.\nWe do not know when or how the conservatorship will terminate. Moreover, even if the conservatorship is terminated, we remain subject to the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, senior preferred stock and warrant, which can only be canceled or modified with the consent of Treasury. The conservatorship and investment by Treasury have had, and will continue to have, material adverse effects on our common and preferred shareholders, including the following:\nNo voting rights during conservatorship. The rights and powers of our shareholders are suspended during the conservatorship. The conservatorship has no specified termination date. During the conservatorship, our common shareholders do not have the ability to elect directors or to vote on other matters unless the conservator delegates this authority to them.\nDividends to common and preferred shareholders, other than to Treasury, have been eliminated. Our conservator announced in September 2008 that we would not pay any dividends on the common stock or on any series of preferred stock, other than the senior preferred stock, while we are in conservatorship. In addition, under the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, dividends may not be paid to common or preferred shareholders (other than on the senior preferred stock) without the prior written consent of Treasury, regardless of whether we are in conservatorship.\nOur future profits will effectively be distributed to Treasury. As described in a risk factor above, the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement and the senior preferred stock ultimately require the payment of our entire net worth to Treasury. As a result, our net income is not available to common shareholders or preferred shareholders other than Treasury as holder of the senior preferred stock.\nLiquidation preference of senior preferred stock is high and could increase. The senior preferred stock ranks prior to our common stock and all other series of our preferred stock, as well as any capital stock we issue in the future, as to both dividends and distributions upon liquidation. Accordingly, if we are liquidated, the senior preferred stock is entitled to its then-current liquidation preference, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, before any distribution is made to the holders of our common stock or other preferred stock. The liquidation preference on the senior preferred stock is currently $117.1 billion and would increase if we draw on Treasury\u2019s funding commitment in any future quarters or if we do not pay dividends owed on the senior preferred stock. If we are liquidated, we believe it is unlikely that there would be sufficient funds remaining after payment of amounts to our creditors and to Treasury as holder of the senior preferred stock to make any distribution to holders of our common stock and other preferred stock.\nExercise of the Treasury warrant would substantially dilute investment of current shareholders. If Treasury exercises its warrant to purchase shares of our common stock equal to 79.9% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, the ownership interest in the company of our then existing common shareholders will be substantially diluted, and we would thereafter have a controlling shareholder.\nNo longer managed for the benefit of shareholders. Because we are in conservatorship, we are no longer managed with a strategy to maximize shareholder returns.\nFor additional description of the restrictions on us and the risks to our shareholders, see \u201cBusiness-Conservatorship and Treasury Agreements.\u201d\nBasel III and U.S. capital and liquidity rules could materially and adversely affect demand by banks for our debt and MBS securities in the future and otherwise could affect the future business practices of our customers and counterparties.\nBasel III is a set of revised global regulatory standards developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision establishing minimum bank capital and liquidity requirements. U.S. banking regulators have issued rules regarding new bank capital and liquidity requirements in accordance with Basel III that are expected to go into effect over the next few years. Although we are not subject to banking regulations, these new requirements could materially adversely affect demand by U.S. banks for our debt securities and MBS in the future, which could adversely affect the price of those securities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nFor example, in September 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final regulation setting minimum liquidity standards for large U.S. banks generally in accordance with Basel III standards. Under the final rule, U.S. banks subject to the standards are required to hold a minimum level of high-quality liquid assets based on projections of their short-term cash needs. The debt and mortgage-related securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are permitted to count toward only up to 40% of the banks\u2019 high-quality liquid asset requirement, and then only after applying a 15% discount to the market value of those securities. The final rule became effective January 1, 2015 and provides for a transition period. Banks subject to the rule are required to maintain a minimum liquidity coverage ratio of 80% beginning on January 1, 2015, 90% beginning on January 1, 2016 and 100% beginning on January 1, 2017. U.S. banks currently hold large amounts of our outstanding debt and MBS securities, and prior U.S. banking regulations did not limit the amount of these securities that banks were permitted to count toward their liquidity requirements. Accordingly, the implementation of this rule could materially adversely affect demand by banks for Fannie Mae debt securities and MBS in the future.\nIn addition, in April 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule for enhanced supplementary leverage ratio requirements applicable to the largest U.S. banks. The rule requires bank holding companies to maintain a minimum enhanced supplementary leverage ratio of more than 5% in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Covered companies are required to report their supplementary leverage ratio starting January 1, 2015 and to comply with the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio requirement beginning on January 1, 2018. These higher leverage requirements may require large U.S. banks to hold more capital against the securities they hold, including Fannie Mae debt and MBS securities, which could adversely affect demand by these banks for our debt and MBS securities in the future.\nBasel III\u2019s revisions to international capital requirements could limit some lenders\u2019 ability to count the value of their rights to service mortgage loans as assets in meeting their regulatory capital requirements, which may reduce the economic value of mortgage servicing rights. As a result, a number of our customers and counterparties may change their business practices, including reducing the amount of loans they service or exiting servicing altogether.\nWe may incur additional credit-related expenses, particularly in light of the poor credit performance of loans we acquired prior to 2009.\nSome of the mortgage loans we acquired prior to 2009 have performed poorly, which increased our credit losses and credit-related expenses, and our risk of future credit losses and credit-related expenses, as a result of borrowers failing to make required payments of principal and interest on their mortgage loans. In addition, although home prices have improved in each of the last three years on a national basis, a portion of the loans in our single-family guaranty book of business continues to have an estimated mark-to-market LTV ratio greater than 100%, which increases the likelihood that either these borrowers will strategically default on their mortgage loans even if they have the ability to continue to pay the loans or that distressed homeowners will sell their homes in a \u201cshort sale\u201d for significantly less than the unpaid amount of the loans. We present detailed information about the risk characteristics of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business in \u201cMD&A-Risk Management-Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management,\u201d and we present detailed information on our 2014 credit-related expenses, credit losses and results of operations in \u201cMD&A-Consolidated Results of Operations.\u201d The credit performance of loans in our guaranty book of business, particularly those acquired prior to 2009, could deteriorate in the future, particularly if we experience national or regional declines in home prices, weakening economic conditions or high unemployment.\nA failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could materially adversely affect our business, impair our liquidity, cause financial losses and harm our reputation.\nShortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems could disrupt our business or have a material adverse effect on our risk management, liquidity, financial statement reliability, financial condition and results of operations. Such a failure could result in legislative or regulatory intervention or sanctions, liability to customers, financial losses, business disruptions and damage to our reputation. For example, our business is highly dependent on our ability to manage and process, on a daily basis, an extremely large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets and in an environment in which we must adapt to changing external conditions. These transactions are subject to various legal, accounting and regulatory standards. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions. In addition, we rely on information provided by third parties in processing many of our transactions; that information may be incorrect or we may fail to properly manage or analyze it.\nWe rely upon business processes that are highly dependent on people, legacy technology and the use of numerous complex systems and models to manage our business and produce books and records upon which our financial statements are prepared. This reliance increases the risk that we may be exposed to financial, reputational or other losses as a result of inadequately designed internal processes or systems, or failed execution of our systems. While we continue to enhance our technology, operational controls and organizational structure in order to reduce our operational risk, these actions may not be effective to manage these risks and may create additional operational risk as we execute these enhancements. In addition, our increased use of third-party service providers for some of our business functions increases the risk that an operational failure by a third party will adversely affect us.\nWe also face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities and derivatives transactions. In recent years, there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses. This consolidation and interconnectivity increases the risk of operational failure, on both an individual basis and an industry-wide basis, as disparate complex systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions or manage our exposure to risk, and could have a significant adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition, net worth and results of operations.\nAdditionally, nearly all of our employees in our primary locations, including the Washington, DC and Dallas, Texas metropolitan areas, work in relatively close proximity to one another. Notwithstanding the business continuity plans and facilities that we have in place, given that most of our facilities and employees are located in the Washington, DC and Dallas metropolitan areas, a catastrophic event such as a terrorist attack, natural disaster, extreme weather event or disease pandemic could overwhelm our recovery capabilities. Although we have built an out-of-region data center for disaster recovery in order to increase the geographic diversity of our business continuity plans, most of our employees are located in the Washington,\nDC and Dallas metropolitan areas. If a regional disruption occurs and our employees are not able to occupy our facilities, work remotely, or communicate with or travel to other locations, we may not be able to successfully implement our contingency plans, which could materially adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and lead to financial losses.\nA breach of the security of our systems, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business or result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential information, which could damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nOur operations rely on the secure receipt, processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and with our business partners, including confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. Information security risks for large institutions like us have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored actors. From time to time we have been, and likely will continue to be, the target of attempted cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks and other information security breaches. To date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, but we could suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our prominent size and scale and our role in the financial services industry, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and the current global economic and political environment. As a result, we have increased our investments in the development and enhancement of controls, processes and practices designed to detect and prevent information security threats.\nAlthough we take measures to protect the security of our computer systems, software and networks, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to cyber attack, breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. The occurrence of such an event could jeopardize or result in the unauthorized disclosure, gathering, monitoring, misuse, corruption, loss or destruction of our or our customers\u2019, our counterparties\u2019 or borrowers\u2019 confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, damage to our computers or systems, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our customers\u2019, our counterparties\u2019 or third parties\u2019 operations. This could result in significant losses, loss of customers and business opportunities, reputational damage, violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks. We currently do not maintain insurance coverage relating to cybersecurity risks.\nThird parties with which we do business may also be sources of cybersecurity or other technological risks. We outsource certain functions and these relationships allow for the storage and processing of our information, as well as customer, counterparty and borrower information. While we engage in actions to mitigate our exposure resulting from outsourcing, ongoing threats may result in unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data or other cybersecurity incidents with increased costs and consequences to us such as those described above.\nOur implementation of FHFA directives and other initiatives may increase our operational risk and result in one or more significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe magnitude of the many new initiatives we are undertaking, including as part of our effort to help build a sustainable housing finance system, may increase our operational risk. Some actions we have been directed to take by FHFA also present significant operational challenges for us, and we believe that implementing these directives will increase our operational risk and could result in one or more significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in a future period. We are working with FHFA and Freddie Mac on a multi-year effort to build a common securitization platform to eventually replace some of our current securitization infrastructure. This initiative, in coordination with related internal infrastructure upgrades, is expected to result in significant changes to our current systems and operations, and involves a high degree of complexity. We are also currently working on implementing a number of other FHFA directives and initiatives that may increase our operational burdens and our costs.\nWhile implementation of each individual initiative and directive creates operational challenges, implementing multiple initiatives and directives during the same time period significantly increases these challenges. Implementing these initiatives and directives requires a substantial time commitment from management and the employees responsible for implementing the changes, limiting the amount of time they can spend on other corporate priorities. In addition, some of these initiatives and directives require significant changes to our accounting methods and systems. Due to the operational complexity associated with these changes and the limited time periods for implementing them, we believe there is a significant risk that\nimplementing these changes could result in one or more significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in a future period. If this were to occur, we could experience material errors in our reported financial results. In addition, FHFA, Treasury, other agencies of the U.S. government or Congress may require us to take actions in the future that could further increase our operational risk.\nWe may undertake efforts that adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nIn conservatorship our business is no longer managed with a strategy to maximize shareholder returns while fulfilling our mission. In May 2014, FHFA released its 2014 Strategic Plan for the Conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which identifies three strategic goals that are described in \u201cBusiness-Executive Summary-Helping to Build a Sustainable Housing Finance System.\u201d In pursuit of these or other goals prescribed by our conservator, we may take a variety of actions that could adversely affect our economic returns, possibly significantly, such as modifying loans to defer principal, lower the interest rate or extend the maturity; engaging in principal reduction; expanding our underwriting and eligibility requirements to increase access to mortgage credit; or issuing a single common GSE security. We are already taking some of these actions. These activities may have short- and long-term adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nOther agencies of the U.S. government or Congress also may ask us to undertake significant efforts to support the housing and mortgage markets, as well as struggling homeowners. They may also ask us to take actions in support of other goals. For example, in December 2011 Congress enacted the TCCA under which, at the direction of FHFA, we increased the guaranty fee on all single-family residential mortgages delivered to us by 10 basis points effective April 1, 2012. This fee increase helps offset the cost of a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut from January 1, 2012 through February 29, 2012. FHFA and Treasury advised us to remit this fee increase to Treasury with respect to all loans acquired by us on or after April 1, 2012 and before January 1, 2022, and to continue to remit these amounts to Treasury on and after January 1, 2022 with respect to loans we acquired before this date until those loans are paid off or otherwise liquidated.\nWe are also required by the GSE Act to undertake efforts in support of the housing market that could adversely affect our financial results and condition. For example, we are subject to housing goals under the GSE Act that require that a portion of the mortgage loans we acquire must be for low- and very-low income families, families in low-income census tracts and moderate-income families in minority census tracts or designated disaster areas. FHFA\u2019s proposed 2015 to 2017 housing goals include higher benchmarks for some of the goals than those that were applicable for 2014. In addition, the 2008 Reform Act created a new duty to serve underserved markets. We could be required to make changes to our business and our acquisitions in the future in response to this duty. Although FHFA has not yet published a final rule with respect to this requirement, FHFA has indicated that a proposed rulemaking on the duty to serve underserved markets is forthcoming and FHFA\u2019s 2015 conservatorship scorecard includes an objective for us to prepare to implement duty to serve requirements upon publication of a final rule. We may take actions to meet our housing goals and duty to serve obligations that could adversely affect our profitability. For example, we may acquire loans that offer lower expected returns on our investment than our other loan acquisitions and that may potentially increase our credit losses and credit-related expenses. If we do not meet our housing goals or duty to serve requirements, and FHFA finds that the goals or requirements were feasible, we may become subject to a housing plan that could require us to take additional steps that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cBusiness-Our Charter and Regulation of Our Activities-The GSE Act-Housing Goals and Duty to Serve Underserved Markets\u201d for more information on our housing goals and duty to serve underserved markets.\nLimitations on our ability to access the debt capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our operations and generate net interest income.\nOur ability to fund our business depends primarily on our ongoing access to the debt capital markets. The level of net interest income generated by our retained mortgage portfolio assets depends on how much lower our cost of funds is compared with what we earn on our mortgage assets. Market concerns about matters such as the extent of government support for our business, the future of our business (including future profitability, future structure, regulatory actions and GSE status) and the creditworthiness of the U.S. government could cause a severe negative effect on our access to the unsecured debt markets, particularly for long-term debt. We believe that our ability in recent years to issue debt of varying maturities at attractive pricing resulted from federal government support of our business. As a result, we believe that our status as a GSE and continued federal government support is essential to maintaining our access to debt funding. Changes or perceived changes in federal government support of our business or our status as a GSE could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the government will continue to support us, or that our current level of access to debt funding will continue. In addition, due to our reliance on the U.S. government\u2019s\nsupport, our access to debt funding also could be materially adversely affected by a change or perceived change in the creditworthiness of the U.S. government.\nFuture changes or disruptions in the financial markets could significantly change the amount, mix and cost of funds we obtain, as well as our liquidity position. If we are unable to issue both short- and long-term debt securities at attractive rates and in amounts sufficient to operate our business and meet our obligations, it likely would interfere with the operation of our business and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and net worth.\nOur liquidity contingency plans may be difficult or impossible to execute during a liquidity crisis.\nWe believe that our liquidity contingency plans may be difficult or impossible to execute during a liquidity crisis. If we cannot access the unsecured debt markets, our ability to repay maturing indebtedness and fund our operations could be eliminated or significantly impaired. In this event, our alternative sources of liquidity-consisting of our cash and other investments portfolio and the unencumbered mortgage assets in our retained mortgage portfolio-may not be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.\nWe believe that the amount of mortgage-related assets that we could successfully sell or borrow against in the event of a liquidity crisis or significant market disruption is substantially lower than the amount of mortgage-related assets we hold. Due to the large size of our portfolio of mortgage assets, current market conditions and the significant amount of distressed assets in our retained mortgage portfolio, there would likely be insufficient market demand for large amounts of these assets over a prolonged period of time, which would limit our ability to borrow against or sell these assets.\nTo the extent that we are able to obtain funding by pledging or selling mortgage-related securities as collateral, we anticipate that a discount would be applied that would reduce the value assigned to those securities. Depending on market conditions at the time, this discount could result in proceeds significantly lower than the current market value of these securities and could thereby reduce the amount of financing we obtain. In addition, our primary source of collateral is Fannie Mae MBS that we own. In the event of a liquidity crisis in which the future of our company is uncertain, counterparties may be unwilling to accept Fannie Mae MBS as collateral. As a result, we may not be able to sell or borrow against these securities in sufficient amounts to meet our liquidity needs.\nA decrease in the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt could have an adverse effect on our ability to issue debt on reasonable terms, and would likely do so if such a decrease were not based on a similar action on the credit ratings of the U.S. government. A decrease in our credit ratings also could trigger additional collateral requirements under our derivatives contracts.\nCredit ratings on our senior unsecured debt, as well as the credit ratings of the U.S. government, are primary factors that could affect our borrowing costs and our access to the debt capital markets. Credit ratings on our debt are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies. Actions by governmental entities impacting the support we receive from Treasury could adversely affect the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt. As of February 12, 2015, our long-term debt was rated \u201cAA+\u201d by Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services (\u201cS&P\u201d), \u201cAaa\u201d by Moody\u2019s Investors Services (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) and \u201cAAA\u201d by Fitch Ratings Limited (\u201cFitch\u201d).\nBecause we rely on the U.S. government for capital support, in recent years, when a rating agency has taken an action relating to the U.S. government\u2019s credit rating, they have taken a similar action relating to our ratings at approximately the same time. S&P, Moody\u2019s and Fitch have all indicated that they would likely lower their ratings on the debt of Fannie Mae and certain other government-related entities if they were to lower their ratings on the U.S. government. We currently cannot predict whether one or more of these rating agencies will downgrade our debt ratings in the future, nor can we predict the potential impact. Although S&P\u2019s downgrade of our credit rating from \u201cAAA\u201d to \u201cAA+\u201d in August 2011 has not increased our borrowing costs or limited our access to the debt capital markets to date, an additional reduction in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our access to debt funding or on the cost of our debt funding, and would likely do so if it were not based on a similar action on the credit ratings of the U.S. government.\nAn additional reduction in our credit ratings may also trigger additional collateral requirements under our derivative contracts because a majority of our over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivative contracts contain provisions that require our senior unsecured debt to maintain a minimum credit rating from S&P and Moody\u2019s. If our senior unsecured debt credit ratings were downgraded to established thresholds in our OTC derivative contracts, which range from A+ to BBB+, we could be required to provide additional collateral to or terminate transactions with certain counterparties. The aggregate fair value of all OTC derivatives with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 31, 2014 was $2.6 billion, for which we posted collateral of $2.4 billion in the normal course of business. If our senior unsecured debt had been downgraded to AA or Aa1, or even to AA- or Aa2, we would not have been required to post any additional collateral under these agreements as of December 31, 2014. If all of the credit-risk-related contingency features underlying these agreements\nhad been triggered, an additional $269 million would have been required either to be posted as collateral or to immediately settle our positions based on the individual agreements and our fair value position as of December 31, 2014. An additional reduction in our credit ratings also could cause derivatives clearing organizations or their members to demand that we post additional collateral for our cleared derivative contracts. Further, an additional reduction in our credit ratings may materially adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to conduct our normal business operations, our financial condition and our results of operations. Our credit ratings and ratings outlook are included in \u201cMD&A-Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Credit Ratings.\u201d\nOne or more of our institutional counterparties may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, resulting in financial losses, business disruption and decreased ability to manage risk.\nWe face the risk that one or more of our institutional counterparties may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. Our primary exposures to institutional counterparty risk are with mortgage servicers that service the loans we hold in our retained mortgage portfolio or that back our Fannie Mae MBS; mortgage sellers and servicers that are obligated to repurchase loans from us or reimburse us for losses in certain circumstances; third-party providers of credit enhancement on the mortgage assets that we hold in our retained mortgage portfolio or that back our Fannie Mae MBS, including mortgage insurers, lenders with risk sharing arrangements, financial guarantors and reinsurers; issuers of investments held in our cash and other investments portfolio; and derivatives counterparties.\nWe may have multiple exposures to one counterparty as many of our counterparties provide several types of services to us. For example, our lender customers or their affiliates may also act as derivatives counterparties, mortgage servicers, custodial depository institutions or document custodians. Accordingly, if one of these counterparties were to become insolvent or otherwise default on its obligations to us, it could harm our business and financial results in a variety of ways.\nAn institutional counterparty may default in its obligations to us for a number of reasons, such as changes in financial condition that affect its credit rating, changes in its servicer rating, a reduction in liquidity, operational failures or insolvency. Although the liquidity and financial condition of some of our institutional counterparties continued to improve in 2014, there is still significant risk to our business of defaults by these counterparties. Counterparty defaults or limitations on their ability to do business with us could result in significant financial losses or hamper our ability to do business, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nWe routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry. Many of the transactions we engage in with these counterparties expose us to credit risk relating to the possibility of a default by our counterparties. In addition, to the extent these transactions are secured, our credit risk may be exacerbated to the extent that the collateral we hold cannot be realized or can be liquidated only at prices too low to recover the full amount of our exposure. These losses could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nWe depend on our ability to enter into derivatives transactions in order to manage the duration and prepayment risk of our retained mortgage portfolio. If we lose access to our derivatives counterparties, it could adversely affect our ability to manage these risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected if mortgage servicers fail to perform their obligations to us.\nWe delegate the servicing of the mortgage loans in our guaranty book of business to mortgage servicers; we do not have our own servicing function. Functions performed by mortgage servicers on our behalf include collecting and delivering principal and interest payments, administering escrow accounts, monitoring and reporting delinquencies, performing default prevention activities and other functions. The inability of a mortgage servicer to perform these functions due to financial, operational, regulatory or other issues could negatively affect our ability to manage our book of business, delay or prevent our collection of amounts due to us or otherwise result in the failure to perform other servicing duties, resulting in financial losses. In addition, our servicers have an active role in our loss mitigation efforts, and a decline in their performance could affect our credit performance, including through missed opportunities for loan modifications.\nIn recent periods, non-depository servicers that specialize in servicing troubled loans have experienced rapid growth in their servicing portfolios, and now service a large portion of our loans. The rapid expansion of these servicers\u2019 servicing portfolios results in increased operational risk, which could negatively impact their ability to effectively manage their servicing portfolios. In addition, regulatory bodies have been reviewing the activities of some of our largest non-depository servicers.\nIf we replace a mortgage servicer, we likely would incur costs and potential increases in servicing fees and could also face operational risks. If a mortgage servicer counterparty fails, it could result in a temporary disruption in servicing and loss\nmitigation activities relating to the loans serviced by that mortgage servicer, particularly if there is a loss of experienced servicing personnel. We may also face challenges in transferring a large servicing portfolio.\nMultifamily mortgage servicing is typically performed by the lenders who sell the mortgages to us. We are exposed to the risk that multifamily servicers could come under financial pressure, which could potentially result in a decline in the quality of the servicing they provide us.\nWe may incur losses as a result of claims under our mortgage insurance policies not being paid in full or at all.\nWe rely heavily on mortgage insurers to provide insurance against borrower defaults on single-family conventional mortgage loans with LTV ratios over 80% at the time of acquisition. Several of our mortgage insurer counterparties incurred losses in recent years, which increases the risk that these counterparties may fail to fulfill their obligations to pay in full our claims under insurance policies.\nPMI Mortgage Insurance Co. (\u201cPMI\u201d), Triad Guaranty Insurance Corporation (\u201cTriad\u201d) and Republic Mortgage Insurance Company (\u201cRMIC\u201d) are under various forms of supervised control by their state regulators and are in run-off. A mortgage insurer that is in run-off continues to collect renewal premiums and process claims on its existing insurance business, but no longer writes new insurance, which increases the risk that the mortgage insurer will pay claims only in part or fail to pay claims at all under existing insurance policies. Entering run-off may close off a source of profits and liquidity that may have otherwise assisted a mortgage insurer in paying claims under insurance policies, and could also cause the quality and speed of its claims processing to deteriorate. PMI and Triad have been paying only a portion of policyholder claims and deferring the remaining portion. PMI is currently paying 67% of claims under its mortgage insurance policies in cash and is deferring the remaining 33%, and Triad is currently paying 75% of claims in cash and deferring the remaining 25%. It is uncertain whether PMI or Triad will be permitted in the future to pay any remaining deferred policyholder claims and/or increase or decrease the amount of cash they pay on claims. RMIC is no longer deferring payments on policyholder claims and has paid us its previously outstanding deferred payment obligations; however, RMIC has not paid us interest on its deferred payment obligations and remains in run-off and under the supervisory control of its state regulator. PMI, Triad and RMIC provided a combined $12.3 billion, or 11%, of our risk in force mortgage insurance coverage of our single-family guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2014.\nFrom time to time we assess our mortgage insurer counterparties\u2019 respective abilities to fulfill their obligations to us, and our loss reserves take into account this assessment. If our assessment indicates their ability to pay claims has deteriorated significantly or if our projected claim amounts have increased, it could result in an increase in our loss reserves and our credit losses.\nChanges in the mortgage industry may negatively impact our business.\nA number of our largest single-family mortgage seller and servicer counterparties have reduced or eliminated their purchases of mortgage loans from mortgage brokers and correspondent lenders. As a result, we have been acquiring an increasing portion of our business volume directly from, and a larger portion of our servicing is being performed by, smaller or non-depository financial institutions that may not have the same financial strength, liquidity or operational capacity as our larger depository financial institution counterparties.\nOur top five lender customers in terms of single-family business acquisition volume, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 33% of our single-family business acquisition volume in 2014, compared with approximately 42% in 2013. Our five largest single-family mortgage servicers, including their affiliates, serviced approximately 46% of our single-family guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2014, compared with approximately 49% as of December 31, 2013.\nThe potentially lower financial strength, liquidity and operational capacity of smaller or non-depository mortgage sellers and servicers may negatively affect their ability to satisfy their repurchase or compensatory fee obligations or to service the loans on our behalf. In addition, some of our non-depository mortgage servicer counterparties have grown significantly in recent years, which could negatively impact their ability to effectively manage their servicing portfolios and increase their operational risk. The decrease in the concentration of our business with large depository financial institutions could increase both our institutional counterparty credit risk and our mortgage credit risk, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nThe loss of business volume from a key lender customer could adversely affect our business and result in a decrease in our revenues, especially if we are unable to replace the business volume that customer provided to us.\nOur ability to generate revenue from the purchase and securitization of mortgage loans depends on our ability to acquire a steady flow of mortgage loans from the originators of those loans. Although we have been acquiring an increasing portion of our single-family business volume directly from smaller financial institutions, we have continued to acquire a significant\nportion of our mortgage loans from several large mortgage lenders, with our top five lender customers in terms of single-family business acquisition volume, in the aggregate, accounting for approximately 33% of our single-family business acquisition volume in 2014. Accordingly, maintaining our current business relationships and business volumes with our top lender customers is important to our business. To the extent a key lender customer significantly reduces the volume or quality of mortgage loans that the lender delivers to us or that we are willing to buy from them, we could lose significant business volume that we might be unable to replace, which could adversely affect our business and result in a decrease in our revenues. In addition, a significant reduction in the volume of mortgage loans that we securitize could reduce the liquidity of Fannie Mae MBS, which in turn could have an adverse effect on their market value.\nOur reliance on third parties to service our mortgage loans may impede our efforts to keep people in their homes and adversely affect the re-performance rate of loans we modify.\nMortgage servicers, or their agents and contractors, typically are the primary point of contact for borrowers on our loans. We rely on these mortgage servicers to identify and contact troubled borrowers as early as possible, to assess the situation and offer appropriate options for resolving the problem and to successfully implement a solution. Over the past few years, the demands placed on experienced mortgage loan servicers to service delinquent loans have increased significantly across the industry, straining servicer capacity. To the extent that mortgage servicers are hampered by limited resources or other factors, they may not be successful in conducting their servicing activities in a manner that fully accomplishes our objectives within the timeframe we desire. Further, our servicers have advised us that they have not been able to reach many of the borrowers who may need help with their mortgage loans even when repeated efforts have been made to contact the borrower.\nFor these reasons, our ability to actively manage the troubled loans that we own or guarantee, and to implement our homeownership assistance and foreclosure prevention efforts quickly and effectively, is limited by our reliance on our mortgage servicers. This reliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expect the slow pace of single-family foreclosures in some states will continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and net worth.\nThe processing of foreclosures of single-family loans continues to be slow in a number of states, primarily as a result of the elevated level of foreclosures caused by the housing market downturn that began in 2006, changes in state foreclosure laws, and federal and state servicing requirements imposed by regulatory actions and legal settlements in recent years. The slow pace of foreclosures in some states has negatively affected our foreclosure timelines, credit-related income (expense) and single-family serious delinquency rates, and we expect they will continue to do so. We believe the slow pace of foreclosures in certain states is contributing to a slower recovery of those housing markets.\nChallenges to the MERS\u00ae company, system and processes could pose operational, reputational and legal risks for us.\nMERSCORP Holdings, Inc. (\u201cMERSCORP\u201d) is a privately held company that maintains an electronic registry (the \u201cMERS System\u201d) that tracks servicing rights and ownership of loans in the United States. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\u201cMERS\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of MERSCORP, can serve as a nominee for the owner of a mortgage loan and, in that role, become the mortgagee of record for the loan in local land records. Fannie Mae sellers and servicers may choose to use MERS as a nominee; however, we have prohibited servicers from initiating foreclosures on Fannie Mae loans in MERS\u2019s name. A large portion of the loans we own or guarantee are registered in MERS\u2019s name and the related servicing rights are tracked in the MERS System. The MERS System is widely used by participants in the mortgage finance industry. Along with a number of other organizations in the mortgage finance industry, we are a shareholder of MERSCORP.\nNumerous legal challenges have been made disputing MERS\u2019s ability to initiate foreclosures, act as nominee in local land records, and/or assign mortgages or take other action on behalf of the loan owner. These challenges seek judicial relief ranging from money damages, fines and penalties to injunctive/declaratory relief seeking the prevention of mortgage assignments by MERS and/or the voiding of completed foreclosures in which MERS appeared in the chain of title. These challenges have focused public attention on MERS and on how loans are recorded in local land records. As a result, these challenges could negatively affect MERS\u2019s ability to serve as the mortgagee of record in some jurisdictions, which could cause additional costs and time in the recordation process and could negatively impact our interest in the loans. These challenges also could result in court decisions that substantially delay new or pending foreclosures, or void completed foreclosures in certain jurisdictions, which would require that we re-foreclose on the affected properties, thereby increasing our costs and lengthening the time it takes for us to foreclose on and dispose of the properties.\nIn addition, where MERS is the mortgagee of record, it must execute assignments of mortgages, affidavits and other legal documents in connection with foreclosure proceedings. In April 2011, federal banking regulators and FHFA announced that they were taking enforcement action against MERS and MERSCORP to address significant weaknesses in, among other\nthings, oversight, management supervision and corporate governance at MERS and MERSCORP that were uncovered as part of the regulators\u2019 review of mortgage servicers\u2019 foreclosure processing. Failures by MERS or MERSCORP to apply prudent and effective process controls and to comply with legal and other requirements could pose counterparty, operational, reputational and legal risks for us. If investigations or new regulation or legislation restricts servicers\u2019 use of MERS, our counterparties may be required to record all mortgage transfers in land records, incurring additional costs and time in the recordation process. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these legal challenges to, or the enforcement action against, MERS and MERSCORP or the impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards and policies can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial results.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the FASB or the SEC changes the financial accounting and reporting standards or the policies that govern the preparation of our financial statements. In addition, FHFA provides guidance that affects our adoption or implementation of financial accounting or reporting standards. These changes can be difficult to predict and expensive to implement, and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. We could be required to apply new or revised guidance retrospectively, which may result in the revision of prior period financial statements by material amounts. The implementation of new or revised accounting guidance could have a material adverse effect on our financial results or net worth and result in or contribute to the need for additional draws from Treasury under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement.\nMaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our reported results or disclosures that are not complete or accurate.\nManagement has determined that, as of the date of this filing, we have ineffective disclosure controls and procedures that result in a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has expressed an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting because of the material weakness. Our ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and material weakness could result in errors in our reported results or disclosures that are not complete or accurate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur material weakness relates specifically to the impact of the conservatorship on our disclosure controls and procedures. Because we are under the control of FHFA, some of the information that we may need to meet our disclosure obligations may be solely within the knowledge of FHFA. As our conservator, FHFA has the power to take actions without our knowledge that could be material to our shareholders and other stakeholders, and could significantly affect our financial performance or our continued existence as an ongoing business. Because FHFA currently functions as both our regulator and our conservator, there are inherent structural limitations on our ability to design, implement, test or operate effective disclosure controls and procedures relating to information within FHFA\u2019s knowledge. As a result, we have not been able to update our disclosure controls and procedures in a manner that adequately ensures the accumulation and communication to management of information known to FHFA that is needed to meet our disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws, including disclosures affecting our financial statements. Given the structural nature of this material weakness, we do not expect to remediate this weakness while we are under conservatorship. See \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d for further discussion of management\u2019s conclusions on our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nIn many cases, our accounting policies and methods, which are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management also relies on models in making these estimates.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in applying many of these accounting policies and methods so that these policies and methods comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the appropriate accounting policy or method from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances but might affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that we report. See \u201cNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d for a description of our significant accounting policies.\nWe have identified some of our accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. These accounting policies are described in \u201cMD&A-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d We believe these policies are critical because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about\nmatters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nBecause our financial statements involve estimates for amounts that are very large, even a small change in the estimate can have a significant impact for the reporting period. For example, because our total loss reserves are so large, even a change that has a small impact relative to the size of our loss reserves can have a meaningful impact on our results for the quarter in which we make the change.\nDue to the complexity of the critical accounting policies we have identified, our accounting methods relating to these policies involve substantial use of models. Models are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on assumptions, including assumptions about future events. Our models may not include assumptions that reflect very positive or very negative market conditions and, accordingly, our actual results could differ significantly from those generated by our models. As a result of the above factors, the estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements, as well as our estimates of our future results of operations, may be inaccurate, perhaps significantly.\nFailure of our models to produce reliable results may adversely affect our ability to manage risk and make effective business decisions.\nWe make significant use of quantitative models to measure and monitor our risk exposures and to manage our business. For example, we use models to measure and monitor our exposures to interest rate, credit and market risks, and to forecast credit losses. The information provided by these models is used in making business decisions relating to strategies, initiatives, transactions, pricing and products.\nModels are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on historical data and assumptions regarding factors such as future loan demand, borrower behavior, creditworthiness and home price trends. Other potential sources of inaccurate or inappropriate model results include errors in computer code, bad data, misuse of data, or use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model\u2019s design. Modeling often assumes that historical data or experience can be relied upon as a basis for forecasting future events, an assumption that may be especially tenuous in the face of unprecedented events.\nGiven the challenges of predicting future behavior, management judgment is used at every stage of the modeling process, from model design decisions regarding core underlying assumptions, to interpreting and applying final model output. To control for these inherent imperfections, our primary models are vetted by an independent model risk management team within our Enterprise Risk Division.\nWhen market conditions change quickly and in unforeseen ways, there is an increased risk that the model assumptions and data inputs for our models are not representative of the most recent market conditions. Under such circumstances, we must rely on management judgment to make adjustments or overrides to our models. A formal model update is typically an extensive process that involves basic research, testing, independent validation and production implementation. In a rapidly changing environment, it may not be possible to update existing models quickly enough to properly account for the most recently available data and events. Management adjustments to modeled results are applied within the confines of the governance structure provided by a combination of our model risk management team and our business, finance and risk committees.\nIf our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management decisions, including decisions affecting loan purchases, management of credit losses, guaranty fee pricing, asset and liability management and the management of our net worth. Any of these decisions could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, liquidity, net worth and financial condition. Furthermore, strategies we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable.\nChanges in interest rates or our loss of the ability to manage interest rate risk successfully could adversely affect our financial results and condition, and increase interest rate risk.\nWe fund our operations primarily through the issuance of debt and invest our funds primarily in mortgage-related assets that permit mortgage borrowers to prepay their mortgages at any time. These business activities expose us to market risk, which is the risk of adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments resulting from changes in market conditions. Our most significant market risks are interest rate risk and prepayment risk. We describe these risks in more detail in \u201cMD&A-Risk Management-Market Risk Management, Including Interest Rate Risk Management.\u201d Changes in interest rates affect both the value of our mortgage assets and prepayment rates on our mortgage loans.\nChanges in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth. Our ability to manage interest rate risk depends on our ability to issue debt instruments with a range\nof maturities and other features, including call provisions, at attractive rates and to engage in derivatives transactions. We must exercise judgment in selecting the amount, type and mix of debt and derivatives instruments that will most effectively manage our interest rate risk. The amount, type and mix of financial instruments that are available to us may not offset possible future changes in the spread between our borrowing costs and the interest we earn on our mortgage assets.\nWe mark to market changes in the estimated fair value of our derivatives through our earnings on a quarterly basis, but we do not similarly mark to market changes in some of the financial instruments that generate our interest rate risk exposures. As a result, changes in interest rates, particularly significant changes, can have a significant adverse effect on our earnings and net worth for the quarter in which the changes occur, depending on the nature of the changes and the derivatives we hold at that time. We have experienced significant fair value losses in some periods due to changes in interest rates, and we expect to continue to experience volatility from period to period in our financial results as a result of fair value losses or gains on our derivatives.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect our credit losses. When interest rates increase, our credit losses from loans with adjustable payment terms may increase as borrower payments increase at their reset dates, which increases the borrower\u2019s risk of default, particularly for adjustable-rate loans with interest-only features. Rising interest rates may also reduce the opportunity for these borrowers to refinance into a fixed-rate loan. Similarly, many borrowers may have additional debt obligations, such as home equity lines of credit and second liens, that also have adjustable payment terms. If a borrower\u2019s payment on his or her other debt obligations increases due to rising interest rates or a change in amortization, it increases the risk that the borrower may default on a loan we own or guarantee.\nChanges in spreads could materially impact our results of operations, net worth and the fair value of our net assets.\nSpread risk or basis risk is the resulting impact of changes in the spread between our mortgage assets and our debt and derivatives we use to hedge our position. Changes in market conditions, including changes in interest rates, liquidity, prepayment and default expectations, and the level of uncertainty in the market for a particular asset class may cause fluctuations in spreads. Changes in mortgage spreads have contributed to significant volatility in our financial results in certain periods, due to fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the financial instruments that we mark to market through our earnings, and this could occur again in a future period. A widening of mortgage spreads could cause significant fair value losses, and could adversely affect our near-term financial results and net worth. We do not actively manage or hedge our spread risk after we purchase mortgage assets, other than through asset monitoring and disposition.\nOur business is subject to laws and regulations that restrict our activities and operations, which may prohibit us from undertaking activities that management believes would benefit our business and limit our ability to diversify our business.\nAs a federally chartered corporation, we are subject to the limitations imposed by the Charter Act, extensive regulation, supervision and examination by FHFA and regulation by other federal agencies, including Treasury, HUD and the SEC. As a company under conservatorship, our primary regulator has management authority over us in its role as our conservator. We are also subject to other laws and regulations that affect our business, including those regarding taxation and privacy.\nThe Charter Act defines our permissible business activities. For example, we may not originate mortgage loans or purchase single-family loans in excess of the conforming loan limits, and our business is limited to the U.S. housing finance sector. In addition, as described in a previous risk factor, our business activities are subject to significant restrictions as a result of the conservatorship and the senior preferred stock purchase agreement. As a result of these limitations on our ability to diversify our operations, our financial condition and results of operations depend almost entirely on conditions in a single sector of the U.S. economy, specifically, the U.S. housing market. Weak or unstable conditions in the housing market, as we have seen in recent years, can therefore have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and net worth.\nOur business and financial results could be materially adversely affected by legal or regulatory proceedings.\nWe are a party to various claims and other legal proceedings. We also have been, and in the future may be, involved in government investigations. We may be required to establish reserves and to make substantial payments in the event of adverse judgments or settlements of any such claims, investigations or proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth. Any legal proceeding or governmental investigation, even if resolved in our favor, could result in negative publicity or cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses. In addition, certain of our former officers are involved in legal proceedings for which they may be entitled to reimbursement by us for costs and expenses of the proceedings.\nDevelopments in, outcomes of, impacts of, and costs, expenses, settlements and judgments related to these legal proceedings and governmental investigations may differ from our expectations and exceed any amounts for which we have reserved or\nrequire adjustments to such reserves. In addition, responding to these matters could divert significant internal resources away from managing our business.\nAn active trading market in our equity securities may cease to exist, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common and preferred stock.\nOur common stock and preferred stock are now traded exclusively in the over-the-counter market. We cannot predict the actions of market makers, investors or other market participants, and can offer no assurances that the market for our securities will be stable. If there is no active trading market in our equity securities, the market price and liquidity of the securities will be adversely affected.\nMortgage fraud could result in significant financial losses and harm to our reputation.\nWe use a process of delegated underwriting in which lenders make specific representations and warranties about the characteristics of the mortgage loans we purchase and securitize. As a result, we do not independently verify most borrower information that is provided to us. This exposes us to the risk that one or more of the parties involved in a transaction (the borrower, seller, broker, appraiser, title agent, lender or servicer) will engage in fraud by misrepresenting facts about a mortgage loan. Similarly, we rely on delegated servicing of loans and use of a variety of external resources to manage our REO. We have experienced financial losses resulting from mortgage fraud, including institutional fraud perpetrated by counterparties. In the future, we may experience additional financial losses or reputational damage as a result of mortgage fraud.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR INDUSTRY\nOur business and financial results are affected by general economic conditions, particularly home prices and employment trends, and a deterioration of economic conditions or the financial markets may materially adversely affect our result of operations, net worth and financial condition.\nOur business is significantly affected by the status of the U.S. economy, particularly home prices and employment trends. Although the U.S. economy has continued to gradually improve, economic growth and improvement in the housing market have been modest. A prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S. economy or any deterioration in general economic conditions or the financial markets could materially adversely affect our result of operations, net worth and financial condition. For example, if home prices decrease or the unemployment rate increases, it could result in significantly higher levels of credit losses and credit-related expense.\nGlobal economic conditions can also adversely affect our business and financial results. Changes or volatility in market conditions resulting from deterioration in or uncertainty regarding global economic conditions can adversely affect the value of our assets, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, net worth and financial condition. For example, weak economic conditions in Europe and concerns about the European banking system resulted in a significant decline in interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2014. This decline in interest rates contributed to the fair value losses on our derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2014. Volatility or uncertainty in global political conditions can also significantly affect economic conditions and the financial markets. We describe above the risks to our business posed by changes in interest rates and changes in spreads. In addition, as described above, future changes or disruptions in the financial markets could significantly change the amount, mix and cost of funds we obtain, as well as our liquidity position.\nA decline in activity in the U.S. housing market or increasing interest rates could lower our business volumes.\nOur business volume is affected by the rate of growth in total U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the U.S. residential mortgage market. A decline in mortgage debt outstanding reduces the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans available for us to securitize or purchase, which in turn could reduce our guaranty fee income and net interest income. Even if we were able to increase our share of the secondary mortgage market, it may not be sufficient to make up for a decline in the rate of growth in mortgage originations.\nMortgage interest rates also affect our business volume. Rising interest rates generally result in fewer mortgage originations, particularly for refinances. Interest rates increased significantly in the second half of 2013, which reduced our business volume in the second half of 2013 and in 2014. Interest rates subsequently declined in late 2014 and early 2015 to levels similar to mid-2013. If interest rates rise again, particularly if the increase is sudden and steep, it could significantly reduce our business volume. Significant reductions in our business volume could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn recent years, the Federal Reserve has purchased a significant amount of mortgage-backed securities issued by us, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. The Federal Reserve began to taper these purchases in January 2014 and concluded its asset purchase program in October 2014. In announcing the conclusion of its asset purchase program, the Federal Reserve stated that it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities; therefore, it has continued to purchase a significant amount of agency mortgage-backed securities. Any change in the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy towards the reinvestment of principal payments of mortgage-backed securities, or possible future sales of mortgage-backed securities by the Federal Reserve, could result in increases in mortgage interest rates and adversely affect our business volume, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and regulatory changes in the financial services industry may negatively impact our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the regulation of the financial services industry. This legislation is affecting and will continue to affect many aspects of our business and could affect us in substantial and unforeseeable ways. The Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory changes have required us to change certain business practices, limit the types of products we offer and incur additional costs. Additionally, implementation of this legislation has resulted in and will continue to result in increased supervision and more comprehensive regulation of our customers and counterparties in the financial services industry, which may have a significant impact on the business practices of our customers and counterparties, as well as on our counterparty credit risk. The Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s impact on our customers\u2019 and counterparties\u2019 business practices could indirectly adversely affect our business. For example, if our customers reduce the amount of their mortgage originations, it would adversely affect the number of mortgages available for us to purchase or guarantee.\nExamples of aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory changes that have affected us or may affect us in the future include: rules requiring the clearing of certain derivatives transactions and margin and capital rules for uncleared derivative trades, which impose additional costs on us; the CFPB\u2019s \u201cability to repay\u201d rule, which has limited the types of products we offer and could impact the volume of loans sold to us in the future; and the development of single-counterparty credit limit regulations, which could cause our customers to change their business practices. We could also be designated as a systemically important nonbank financial company subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve. If this were to occur, the Federal Reserve would have the authority to examine us and could impose stricter prudential standards on us, including risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, single-counterparty exposure limits, resolution plan and credit exposure reporting requirements, overall risk management requirements, contingent capital requirements, enhanced public disclosures and short-term debt limits. We have not received any notification of possible designation as a systemically important financial institution.\nIn addition, the actions of Treasury, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the SEC, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and international central banking authorities directly or indirectly impact financial institutions\u2019 cost of funds for lending, capital-raising and investment activities, which could increase our borrowing costs or make borrowing more difficult for us. Changes in monetary policy are beyond our control and difficult to anticipate.\nOverall, these legislative and regulatory changes could affect us in substantial and unforeseeable ways and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth.\nLegislative, regulatory or judicial actions could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or net worth.\nLegislative, regulatory or judicial actions at the federal, state or local level could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or net worth. Legislative, regulatory or judicial actions could affect us in a number of ways, including by imposing significant additional costs on us and diverting management attention or other resources. For example, we could be affected by legislative or regulatory changes that expand the responsibilities and liabilities of servicers and assignees for maintaining vacant properties prior to foreclosure, which could increase our costs. We also could be affected by state laws and court decisions granting priority rights for homeowners associations in foreclosure proceedings, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our losses on affected loans. In addition, as described above, our business could be materially adversely affected by legislative and regulatory actions relating to housing finance reform or the financial services industry or by legal or regulatory proceedings.\nThe occurrence of a major natural or other disaster in the United States could negatively impact our credit losses and credit-related expenses, and could disrupt our business operations in the affected geographic area or nationally.\nWe conduct our business in the residential and multifamily mortgage markets and own or guarantee the performance of mortgage loans throughout the United States. The occurrence of a major natural or environmental disaster, terrorist attack, cyber attack, pandemic, or similar event (a \u201cmajor disruptive event\u201d) in a regional geographic area of the United States could\nnegatively impact our credit losses and credit-related expenses in the affected area or, depending on the nature of the event, nationally.\nThe occurrence of a major disruptive event could negatively impact a geographic area in a number of different ways, depending on the nature of the event. A major disruptive event that either damages or destroys residential or multifamily real estate securing mortgage loans in our book of business or negatively impacts the ability of borrowers to continue to make principal and interest payments on mortgage loans in our book of business could increase our delinquency rates, default rates and average loan loss severity of our book of business in the affected region or regions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth. While we attempt to create a geographically diverse mortgage credit book of business, there can be no assurance that a major disruptive event, depending on its magnitude, scope and nature, will not generate significant credit losses and credit-related expenses.\nIn addition, as described in a risk factor above, although we have business continuity plans and facilities in place, the occurrence of a catastrophic event could overwhelm our recovery capabilities, which could materially adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and lead to financial losses.", "PERMNO": 51043, "SIC": 6111, "TIC": "FNMA"}
