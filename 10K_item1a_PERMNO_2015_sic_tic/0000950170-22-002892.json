Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to those discussed below. Any of these factors could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to vary material from recent results of future anticipated results.\nIndustry and Economic Risks\nDue to the Company\u2019s dependency on the energy and telecommunication industries, the Company is susceptible to negative trends relating to those industries that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s sales to the energy and telecommunication industries represent a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s historical sales. The concentration of revenue in such industries is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. Demand for products to these industries depends primarily on capital spending by customers for constructing, rebuilding, maintaining or upgrading their systems. The amount of capital spending and, therefore, the Company\u2019s sales and profitability are affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, access by customers to financing, government regulation, demand for energy and cable services, energy prices and technological factors. As a result, some customers may significantly reduce or delay their spending or may not continue as going concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the Company may incur exit-related costs and impairments of goodwill, definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, fixtures and equipment as the Company makes corresponding changes to its business to reflect these changes and uncertainties in the Company\u2019s industries and customer demand, and these costs and impairments could have a significant negative impact on the Company\u2019s operating results for the period in which they are incurred. Consolidation presents an additional risk to the Company in that merged customers will rely on relationships with a source other than the Company. Consolidation may also increase the pressure on suppliers, such as the Company, to sell product at lower prices.\nThe intense competition in the Company\u2019s markets, particularly telecommunication, may lead to a reduction in sales and earnings.\nThe markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive. The level of intensity of competition may increase in the foreseeable future due to anticipated growth in the telecommunication and data communication industries. The Company\u2019s competitors in the telecommunication and data communication markets are larger companies with significant influence over the distribution network. The Company may not be able to compete successfully against its competitors, many of which may have access to greater financial resources than the Company. In addition, the pace of technological development in the telecommunication market is rapid and these advances (i.e., wireless, fiber optic network infrastructure, etc.) may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to compete in this market.\nCompetitors\u2019 introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products or products under development obsolete or unmarketable and result in lost sales.\nThe energy and telecommunication industries are characterized by rapid technological change. Satellite, wireless and other communication technologies currently being deployed may represent a threat to copper, coaxial and fiber optic-based systems by reducing the need for wire-line networks. Future advances or further development of these or other new technologies may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition as a result of lost sales.\nPrice increases or decreased or delayed availability of raw materials could result in lower earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s cost of sales may be materially adversely affected by increases in the market prices of the raw materials used in the Company\u2019s manufacturing processes. During 2021, the Company implemented several price increases in the U.S. and internationally to mitigate rising material costs. This may have impacted or could continue to impact the Company's demand for its products. The Company may not be able to pass on further price increases in raw materials to the Company\u2019s customers through increases in product prices. As a result, the Company\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, any decrease or delay in the availability of these materials or interruptions generally in the global supply chain could slow production and delivery to the Company\u2019s customers. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent inflation, which is expected to continue, has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the global supply chain and could have a material, adverse effect on the ability to secure raw materials and supplies.\nThe Company\u2019s international operations subject the Company to additional business risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nInternational sales account for a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s net sales (50%, 57% and 60% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively). Due to its international sales, the Company is subject to the risks of conducting business internationally, including unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, which could materially adversely affect U.S. dollar sales or operating expenses, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, potentially longer payment cycles, greater difficulty in accounts\nreceivable collection, reduced or limited protection of intellectual property rights, potentially adverse taxes and the burdens of complying with a variety of international laws and communications standards. The Company is subject to foreign currency volatility, which could materially impact the Company\u2019s operating results, including the impact of hyper-inflationary conditions in certain economies, particularly where exchange controls limit or eliminate the Company\u2019s ability to convert from local currency. The Company is also subject to general geopolitical risks, such as political and economic instability, social unrest, acts of war, military conflict, international hostilities or the perception that hostilities may be imminent, terrorism and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including any retaliatory measures, sanctions or tariffs imposed in response to any acts of war or military conflicts in connection with its international operations. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of the Company\u2019s products and the loss of sales and customers. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending or the economy in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally. These risks of conducting business internationally may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nAdditionally, in 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d). Continued uncertainty relating to Brexit could adversely impact the Company. The United Kingdom formally exited the European Union on January 31, 2020 and had a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020. Since January 1, 2021, the European Union - United Kingdom Trade and Cooperative Agreement has provisionally been in effect and entered into force on May 21, 2021. Due to the lack of comparable precedent, the ultimate effect of Brexit and the trade and cooperative agreement are difficult to predict and could continue to have a further adverse impact on global economic conditions, the stability of global financial markets and global market liquidity, including effects on the discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR as a reference interest rate included under the Company\u2019s credit facility. Any of these factors could depress economic activity or lead to long-term volatility in the currency markets which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's financial results could be adversely affected by the change in interest rates.\nAny period of interest rate increases may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability. As of December 31, 2021, 38% of the Company's indebtedness bears interest at rates that float with the market. A higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates. Additionally, the interest rates on some of the Company\u2019s debt is tied to LIBOR. The use of LIBOR is expected to be phased out by June 2023. The uncertainty regarding the transition from LIBOR to another reference rate or rates could have adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s available debt that currently uses LIBOR as a reference rate, and ultimately, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to public health concerns, including viral outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Worldwide economic conditions have been significantly impacted by COVID-19 and the effects could continue to have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and businesses as government authorities could continue to impose mandatory closures, work-from-home orders and social distancing protocols along with other unknown potential restrictions. COVID-19 has disrupted and could continue to disrupt the global supply chain, which could have a material, adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to secure raw materials and supplies and could result in increased costs and the loss of sales and customers. The impact of COVID-19 could potentially exacerbate all the risks discussed and lead to the creation of new risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. The duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be predicted, and therefore, any anticipated negative financial impact to the Company\u2019s operating results cannot be reasonably estimated.\nBusiness and Operations Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business will suffer if the Company fails to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the changing needs of the Company\u2019s customers.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis is a significant factor in the Company\u2019s ability to grow and remain competitive. New product development often requires long-term forecasting of market trends, development and implementation of new designs and processes and a substantial capital commitment. The trend toward consolidation of the energy, telecommunication and data communication industries may require the Company to quickly adapt to rapidly changing market conditions and customer requirements. Any failure by the Company to anticipate or respond in a cost-effective and timely manner to technological developments or changes in industry standards or customer requirements, or any significant delays in product development or introduction or any failure of new products to be widely accepted by the Company\u2019s customers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition as a result of reduced net sales.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully integrate businesses that it may acquire in the future or complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s growth in sales and earnings has been generated from acquisitions. The Company expects to continue a strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products. In connection with this growth strategy, the Company faces certain risks and uncertainties in addition to the risks faced in the Company\u2019s day-to-day operations, including the risks pertaining to integrating acquired businesses, realizing the benefits of acquired technology, utilizing new personnel and operating in new jurisdictions. In addition, the Company may incur debt to finance future acquisitions, and the Company may issue securities in connection with future acquisitions that may dilute the holdings of current and future shareholders. Covenant restrictions relating to additional indebtedness could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends, fund capital expenditures, consummate additional acquisitions and significantly increase the Company\u2019s interest expense. Any failure to successfully complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate such strategic acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company may have interruptions in or lose business due to the uncertainty of the global economy, specifically related to the lack of available funding for the Company\u2019s customers.\nThe demand for the Company\u2019s products is significantly affected by the amount of discretionary business and consumer spending, each of which is impacted by the continued uncertainty of the global economy. The Company\u2019s operations could be adversely affected by global economic conditions such as recession, political or social unrest, economic instability, acts of war, military conflict, international hostilities or the perception that hostilities may be imminent, terrorism and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including any retaliatory measures, sanctions or tariffs imposed in response to any acts of war or military conflicts, public health concerns or otherwise. The liquidity and financial position of the Company\u2019s customers could also impact their ability to pay in full and/or on a timely basis. This lack of funding could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company employs information technology systems to support its business, and any material breach, interruption or failure may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company employs information technology systems to support its business. Security breaches and other disruptions to the Company\u2019s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company\u2019s operations, and compromise information belonging to the Company and its customers, suppliers and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of its businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite the Company\u2019s cybersecurity measures and oversight of such matters by the Board of Directors, which are continuously reviewed and upgraded, the Company\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure and protected data may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service providers including cloud services, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, up to and including several years. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nLegal, Tax and Regulatory Risks\nThe Company may be adversely impacted by laws, regulation, and litigation.\nThe Company is subject to various laws and regulation. For example, extensive environmental regulations related to air and water quality, the discharge of pollutants, climate change, the handling of toxic waste and the handling and transport of products and components classified as hazardous impact its daily operations. The introduction of new laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, could increase the costs of doing business. It is difficult to predict what impact, if any, changes in federal policy, including environmental and tax policies will have on our industry, the economy as a whole, consumer confidence and spending. As a result, the nature, timing and impact on our business of potential changes to the current legal and regulatory frameworks are uncertain. At any given time, the Company may also be subject to litigation or claims related to its products, suppliers, customers, employees, shareholders, distributors, sales representatives, intellectual property or acquisitions, among other things, the disposition of which may have an adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operation. The outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify. Lawsuits can result in the payment of substantial damages by defendants. If the Company is required to pay substantial damages and expenses as a result of these or other types of lawsuits, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations would be adversely affected. Regardless of whether any claims against the Company are valid or whether it is liable, claims may be expensive to defend,\nmay cause reputational harm (particularly where any claims relate to significant harm to persons and property) and may divert time and money away from the Company\u2019s operations. Insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of the Company\u2019s insurance coverage or financial statement accruals for any claims could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully manage its intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.\nThe Company relies on a combination of contractual rights and patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws to establish and protect its proprietary technology. Third parties may challenge, invalidate, circumvent, infringe or misappropriate the Company\u2019s intellectual property, or such intellectual property may not be sufficient to permit the Company to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Others, including its competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate or design around the Company\u2019s intellectual property, and in such cases, it could not assert its intellectual property rights against such parties. The Company may also be subject to costly litigation in the event its technology infringes upon or otherwise violate a third party\u2019s proprietary rights. Any claim from third parties may result in a limitation on its ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims or the requirement to pay a licensing fee or royalty. The Company may be forced to litigate to enforce or determine the scope and enforceability of its intellectual property rights, trade secrets and know-how, which is expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove successful, especially in countries where such rights are more difficult to enforce. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to obtain third party intellectual property could harm its business and ability to compete.\nTax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating the provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of its foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where the Company has lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where the Company has higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which the Company is not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any related valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. In addition, many countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the proposed U.S. Build Back Better Plan, which potentially could raise the U.S. corporate tax rate. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign governments facilitated economic stimulus by enacting new tax legislation throughout 2021. Foreign governments will continue to contemplate future changes to tax law to assist in economic recovery. These future changes could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nRisk Factors Related to Human Capital\nThe Company depends on maintaining a skilled workforce and any interruption in the workforce could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to sustain and grow its business requires a commitment to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that the Company has the depth and breadth of personnel with the necessary skill set and experience, the loss of key employees or interruptions in the Company's workforce, including unionization efforts and changes in labor relations, could impede the Company\u2019s ability to deliver its growth objectives and execute its strategy. Additionally, the health of the Company's employees is critical and protection of its employees is the Company's top priority.\nThe Company continues to develop and invest in human capital through continuing education, work-related certifications, and talent and performance management systems. These efforts directly impact the ability to deliver its growth objectives and execute its strategy.", "PERMNO": 89141, "SIC": 3640, "TIC": "PLPC"}
