You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report, including the consolidated audited financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this annual report on Form 10-K, with respect to any investment in shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of the date of this report (unless another date is indicated) and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements in light of future development.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nThere is no guarantee that cash flow from operations and/or debt and equity financings will provide sufficient capital to meet our expansion goals and working capital needs.\nOur current strategic plan includes the expansion of our company both organically and through acquisitions if market conditions and competitive conditions allow. Due to the long-term nature of investments in acquisitions and other financial needs to support organic growth, including working capital, we expect our long-term and working capital needs to periodically exceed the short-term fluctuations in cash flow from operations. We anticipate that we will likely raise additional external capital from the sale of common stock, preferred stock and debt instruments as market conditions may allow, in addition to cash flow from operations (which may not always be sufficient), to fund our growth and working capital needs. In December 2016, we commenced a subscription rights offering to our stockholders to raise up to $15.0 million through the sale of units, each consisting of one share of our series 1 preferred stock, paying cumulative dividends at the rate of 10% of the purchase price per year, and two five-year series 1 warrants, upon the exercise of subscription rights at $10.00 per unit. The rights offering extends through January 2017 and may be extended thereafter. No assurance can be given that the rights offering will result in significant funds for us. We are subject to uncertain and ever-changing debt and equity capital market conditions over which we have no control. The magnitude and the timing of the funds that we need to raise from external sources also cannot be easily predicted.\nIn the event that we need to raise significant amounts of external capital at any time or over an extended period, we face a risk that we may need to do so under adverse capital market conditions with the result that persons who acquire our common stock may incur significant and immediate dilution should we raise capital from the sale of our common or preferred stock. Similarly, we may need to meet our external capital needs from the sale of secured or unsecured debt instruments at interest rates and with such other debt covenants and conditions as the market then requires. In all of these transactions we anticipate that we will likely need to raise significant amounts of additional external capital to support our growth. However, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise external capital on terms that are reasonable in light of current market conditions. In the event that we are not able to do so, those who acquire our common stock may face significant and immediate dilution and other adverse consequences. Further, debt covenants contained in debt instruments that we issue may limit our financial and operating flexibility with consequent adverse impact on our common stock market price.\nWe are substantially dependent upon the success and continued market acceptance of our technology and a favorable regulatory environment; the absence of which may significantly reduce our sales, profits and cash flow and adversely impact our financial condition.\nThe failure of the emissions monitoring and controls market to develop as we anticipate and any lack of acceptance of our emissions monitoring and control equipment technology would adversely affect our environmental control products business. In this respect, we may find that other competing technologies may be offered by other existing competitors or by those that enter the market and these competing technologies may offer a better cost-benefit ratio than our products and/or at lower prices with the result that our sales, profits, and cash flow may suffer significantly over an extended period with serious adverse impact on our financial condition.\nWe have substantial debt which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations and prevent us from meeting our obligations under outstanding indebtedness.\nAs of September 30, 2016, our total indebtedness was approximately $24.2 million, including a revolving line of credit of $3.5 million, convertible notes payable of $3.7 million, non-convertible notes payable of $1.4 million, related party notes payable of $3.6 million, bank loans of $8.0 million and mortgage of $4.0 million. Approximately $7.9 million of such debt is classified as current and approximately $3.7 million of such debt is convertible into shares of our common stock. This substantial debt could have important consequences, including the following: (i) a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations, future business opportunities and capital expenditures; (ii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, debt service requirements and general corporate purposes in the future may be limited; (iii) we may face a competitive disadvantage to lesser leveraged competitors; (iv) our debt service requirements could make it more difficult to satisfy other financial obligations; and (v) we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out activities that are important to our growth.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, or to pay interest on, or to refinance indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond management\u2019s control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of indebtedness, if available at all, could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. Despite our significant amount of indebtedness, we may be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial debt.\nWe have outstanding convertible notes with fluctuating conversion rates that are set at a discount to market prices of our common stock during the period immediately preceding conversion, which may result in material dilution to our common stockholders.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding unsecured convertible notes issued to a number of unrelated third parties in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.7 million. Of these unsecured convertible notes, $373,000 under two notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to 75% of the average closing bid prices of our common stock for the ten days preceding the conversion date (the \u201c75% Notes\u201d), while approximately $1.3 million under three notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to 80% of the average closing bid prices of our common stock for the ten days preceding the conversion date (the \u201c80% Notes\u201d). This could result in material dilution to existing stockholders of our company. The number of shares of common stock into which the notes may be converted may increase without an upper bound as a consequence of the fluctuating conversion rate that is 75% or 80% of the weighted average market price at the time of conversion. By way of illustration, the following table sets forth the dilutive impact of conversion of the unsecured convertible notes, assuming that the average closing bid price of our common stock for the ten days preceding the conversion is equal to $5.00, $4.00, $3.00 and $2.00 per share:\nAdditionally, we have outstanding convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,110,000 with fixed conversion prices ranging from $5.00 to $6.50 per share. Approximately 373,300 shares of our common stock are issuable pursuant to these notes at the election of the holder.\nOur ability to secure and maintain sufficient credit arrangements is key to our continued operations and there is no assurance we will be able to obtain sufficient additional equity or debt financing in the future.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to retain or renew our credit agreements and other finance agreements in the future. In the event the business grows rapidly, the uncertain economic climate continues or we acquire one or more other companies, additional financing resources will likely be necessary in the current or future fiscal years. As a small company with a limited ability to attract and obtain financing, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient additional equity or debt financing in the future on terms that are reasonable in light of current market conditions.\nOur sales and gross margins depend significantly on market demand for our products, as to which there can be no assurances.\nThe uncertainty in the U.S. and international economic and political environment could result in a decline in demand for our products in any industry. Our gross margins are dependent upon our ability to maintain sales volumes at levels that allow us to cover our fixed costs and variable costs per unit. To the extent that one or more product lines experience a significant and protracted decline in sales volume, we may experience significant declines in our gross margins that may result in losses. Further, any adverse changes in tax rates and laws affecting our customers could result in decreases in demand of our products and thus decrease our gross margins. Any of these factors could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of our existing and future customers do not commit to firm production schedules, which may result in higher fixed costs per unit for us relative to our competitors.\nMost of our customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, which makes it difficult to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency at our manufacturing facilities and to manage inventory levels. As a result, our fixed costs per unit may be higher than our competitors who are able to achieve greater economies with longer production runs at lower costs per unit and, at the same time, achieve lower manufacturing costs as a result and as a result of better manufacturing scheduling.\n\u25cf The volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to:\n\u25cf customers\u2019 attempts to manage their inventory;\n\u25cf variation in demand for the company\u2019s customers\u2019 products design changes; or\n\u25cf acquisitions of or consolidation among customers.\nMany of our existing and future customers do not commit to firm production schedules. As a result, we are unable to forecast the level of customer orders with any precision. This means that it is very difficult for us to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity and manage inventory levels. This may adversely impact our unit manufacturing costs so that our unit manufacturing costs may be higher than our competitors\u2019 costs.\nIn these circumstances we anticipate that we could be required to increase or decrease staffing and more closely manage other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our existing and future customers. Orders from our customers are subject to cancellation and delivery schedules fluctuate as a result of changes in our customers\u2019 demand, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations, and may result in higher inventory levels. Higher inventory levels cause us to obtain greater external financing which adversely affects our financial performance.\nOur products could face serious competitive challenges, including rapid technological changes, and pricing pressure from competitors, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn the event that one or more of our product lines become the subject of significant pressures from our existing and future competitors, market conditions, technological change, or any combination thereof, our sales revenues and our gross margins may suffer protracted and serious declines with the result that we will likely incur protracted losses thereby. Further, the barriers to entry in several of our lines of business are not so significant that we may be facing competition from others who see significant opportunities to enter the market and undercut our prices with products that possess superior technological attributes at prices that offer our customers a better value. In this instance we could incur protracted and significant losses and persons who acquire our common stock would suffer losses thereby.\nFactors affecting the industries that utilize our customers\u2019 products could negatively impact our customers and us.\nWe have no real control over these factors and to the extent that any one or more of them change dramatically, we may be facing significant financial challenges that are in excess of our abilities. These factors include:\n\u25cf increased competition among our customers and their competitors;\n\u25cf the inability of our customers to develop and market their products;\n\u25cf recessionary periods in our customers\u2019 markets;\n\u25cf the potential that our customers\u2019 products become obsolete;\n\u25cf our customers\u2019 inability to react to rapidly changing technology;\n\u25cf our customers\u2019 inability to pay for our products, which could, in turn, affect the company\u2019s results of operations.\nIf we are unable to develop new products, our competitors may develop and market products with better features that may reduce demand for our potential products or otherwise result in our products becoming obsolete and could materially and adversely affect our ability to sustain profitability.\nThere are many larger competitors who compete directly with us and who have significantly greater technological and research resources. These larger competitors have greater technological and research abilities that put us at a severe disadvantage. This may serve to severely damage our reputation and our ability to market and sell other products at price levels that would allow us to achieve and maintain profit margins and positive cash flow.\nWe are a small company and we face rapid technological change in many of our product markets and we may not be able to introduce any new products or any enhancements to our existing products on a timely basis, or at all. This could result in prolonged and significant losses. In addition, our introduction of any new products could adversely affect the sales of certain of our existing products if new products cannibalize sales of our existing products. If our competitors develop innovative technologies that are superior to our products or if we fail to accurately anticipate market trends and respond on a timely basis with our own innovations, we may not achieve sufficient growth in its revenues to attain profitability or if we do, we may not be able sustain profitability.\nWe have grown through acquisitions and are continuously looking to fund such acquisitions; our failure to raise funds will have the effect of slowing down our growth.\nWe recently completed the acquisitions of Advanced Industrial Services Inc., an installer of high precision equipment, and Periscope, GmbH, an electronics manufacturing company. We need to raise funds to finance acquisitions and support the working capital requirements of the acquired companies. A portion of the expected net proceeds from our pending $15.0 million subscription rights offering is intended to be used to fund our acquisition growth plan. Through this rights offering, which was commenced in December 2016 and extends through January 2017 and may be extended thereafter, and any subsequent financing transactions. There is substantial risk that we will only be able to raise funds that would cause substantial dilution to the existing stockholders or at terms that may be very expensive. In the past, we have raised funds from related party loans and there can be no assurance that such related party loans will be available to us in the future. Further, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise funds in sufficient amounts in the future and on terms that are reasonable in light of our current circumstances. Persons who acquire our common stock may suffer immediate and substantial dilution and, in other instances, the total loss of their investment if we are not able to raise sufficient funds on reasonable terms. In the event that we are unable to raise funds in sufficient amounts and on reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete any further acquisitions and provide working capital for the completed acquisitions.\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from international operations.\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that may be different from and incremental to those in the United States. In addition to the risks that we face in the United States, our international operations may involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u25cf the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences, including licensing a certain portion of our content library before we have developed a full appreciation for its performance within a given territory;\n\u25cf difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf management distraction;\n\u25cf political or social unrest and economic instability;\n\u25cf compliance with United States laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf less favorable foreign intellectual property laws;\n\u25cf adverse tax consequences such as those related to repatriation of cash from foreign jurisdictions into the United States, non-income related taxes such as value-added tax or other indirect taxes, changes in tax laws or their interpretations, or the application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities given inter-company transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain;\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n\u25cf profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u25cf differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;\n\u25cf new and different sources of competition;\n\u25cf different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws; and\n\u25cf availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion.\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\nEven though we achieved a profit for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we cannot assure you that we will remain profitable and maintain a positive cash flow or, if we are profitable and have a positive cash flow, that we can sustain operations that are profitable and have a positive cash flow in the future.\nWe continue to incur significant expenditures related to selling and marketing and general and administrative activities as well as capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses may increase in the foreseeable future as we expand our business. Further, as a public company we continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we would not incur as a private company. To maintain profitability, we will need to generate significant additional revenues with significantly improved gross margins. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain profitability with our existing revenues and in the future generate such additional revenues, improve our gross margins, or both of them and maintain and sustain our profitability or a positive cash flow.\nWe face constant changes in governmental standards by which our environmental control products are evaluated and we have no control over these standards.\nWe have no ability to predict the extent to which governmental standards and regulations will favor or disfavor our products, our technology, or the business strategies that we have or will implement in the future. There is a distinct risk that we may face governmental standards and regulations that seriously undercut our fundamental assumptions regarding existing trends in regulation and technology and assumptions regarding the type of technology to use. To the extent that we are not able to accurately predict these trends and effectively utilize these predictions in our business strategy, we may suffer protracted losses with the result that persons who acquire our common stock will suffer losses thereby.\nWe believe that, due to the constant focus on the environment and clean air standards throughout the world, a requirement in the future to adhere to new and more stringent regulations both domestically and abroad is possible as governmental agencies seek to improve standards required for certification of products intended to promote clean air. In the event our products fail to meet these ever-changing standards, some or all of our emission monitoring and environmental control products may become obsolete.\nThe future growth of our environmental control business depends, in part, on enforcement of existing emissions-related environmental regulations and further tightening of emission standards worldwide with regulations that allow our products to compete effectively against our competitors.\nWe expect that the future environmental control products business growth will likely be driven, in part, by the enforcement of existing emissions-related environmental regulations and tightening of emissions standards worldwide. If such standards do not continue to become stricter or are loosened or are not enforced by governmental authorities or if such standards require the use of technologies that we do not possess or are not able to develop, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and long-term prospects.\nWe may incur substantial costs enforcing our proprietary information, defending against third-party patents, invalidating third-party patents or licensing third-party intellectual property, as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights.\nWe have undertaken only a limited evaluation of our intellectual property rights and we may discover that one or more of our intellectual property rights infringe upon the patents or rights of others with the result that we may incur significant losses thereby. In that event, any person who acquires our common stock may suffer losses thereby.\nWhile we believe that our technology and procedures are likely proprietary, we cannot assure you that others have not or will not replicate our technology and procedures and achieve greater efficiencies and success at our expense.\nIn that event, we could suffer serious and protracted losses and negative cash flow thereby, our strategy has been to rely on our flexibility to develop custom engineered solutions for various applications and be responsive to customer needs. We cannot assure you that this strategy is or will remain effective to meet these challenges.\nWe may not have sufficient financial resources to defend our intellectual property rights or otherwise successfully defend against claims that we have infringed on a third party\u2019s intellectual property and, as a result, it may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if such claims are not valid, they could subject us to significant costs. In addition, it may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation may also be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. We may not have sufficient financial resources to defend our intellectual property rights or otherwise to successfully defend the company against valid or spurious claims that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others.\nAn adverse outcome in litigation or any similar proceedings could force us to take actions that could harm its business. These include: (i) ceasing to sell products that contain allegedly infringing property; (ii) obtaining licenses to the relevant intellectual property which we may not be able to obtain on terms that are acceptable, or at all; (iii) indemnifying certain customers or strategic partners if it is determined that we have infringed upon or misappropriated another party\u2019s intellectual property; and (iv) redesigning products that embody allegedly infringing intellectual property. Any of these results could adversely and significantly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of defending or asserting any intellectual property claim, both in legal fees and expenses, and the diversion of management resources, regardless of whether the claim is valid, could be significant and lead to significant and protracted losses.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to defend a class action suit from a customer as a result of our installed base of products.\nOur products are installed at large industrial plants where products of other manufacturers and suppliers are also installed. We could be subject to a class action lawsuit from a customer as a result of loss sustained by a customer due to malfunction of another manufacturer\u2019s product. We may not have sufficient financial resources to successfully defend such a lawsuit.\nProduct defects could cause us to incur significant product liability, warranty and repair and support costs and damage our reputation which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough we test our products, defects may be discovered in future or existing products. These defects could cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair costs and divert the attention of research and development personnel. It could also significantly damage our reputation and relationship with distributors and customers which would adversely affect our business. In addition, such defects could result in personal injury or financial or other damages to customers who may seek damages with respect to such losses. A product liability claim against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly to defend. We carry some product liability insurance but we cannot assure you that the amount of coverage that we carry is sufficient to insulate us from these claims. In the event of any claim asserting product defects, we will be directly exposed to liability for claims in excess of our coverage limits and there is a clear risk that we and our stockholders could suffer significant and protracted losses thereby.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and managerial resources than we do.\nThere is significant competition among companies that provide emissions monitoring and environmental control systems. Several companies market products that compete directly with our products. Other companies offer products that potential customers may consider to be acceptable alternatives to our products and services. We face direct competition from companies with far greater financial, technological, manufacturing and personnel resources.\nOur results may fluctuate due to certain regulatory, marketing and competitive factors over which we have little or no control.\nThe factors listed below, some of which we cannot control, may cause our revenue and results of operations to fluctuate significantly:\n\u25cf The existence and enforcement of government environmental regulations. If these regulations are not maintained or enforced then the market for the company\u2019s products could deteriorate;\n\u25cf Retaining and keeping qualified employees and management personnel;\n\u25cf Ability to upgrade our products to keep up with the changing market place requirements;\n\u25cf Ability to keep up with our competitors who have much higher resources than us;\n\u25cf Ability to find sub-suppliers and sub-contractors to assemble and install our products;\n\u25cf General economic conditions of the industry and the ability of potential customers to spend money on setting up new industries that require our products;\n\u25cf Ability to maintain or raise adequate working capital required for the operations and future growth; and\n\u25cf Ability to retain our Chief Executive Officer and other senior key personnel.\nThe loss of the services of Aron Govil and Saagar Govil for any reason would materially and adversely affect our business operations and prospects.\nOur financial success is dependent to a significant degree upon the efforts of Aron Govil, our Executive Director, and Saagar Govil, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Aron Govil, who previously served as our Chairman of the Board, has knowledge regarding environmental control systems and has financial resources and business contacts that would be extremely difficult to replace. Saagar Govil possesses engineering, sales and marketing experience concerning our company that our other officers do not have. We have not entered into employment arrangements with them. There can be no assurance that Aron Govil and Saagar Govil will continue to provide services to us. While Saagar Govil devotes all of his working time to our company, Aron Govil devotes an average of 20 hours per week to our company and the balance of his working time is devoted to other business and investment activities. A voluntary or involuntary departure by Aron Govil and/or Saagar Govil could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations if we were not able to attract a qualified replacement for them in a timely manner.\nWe have a small management team. The loss of any member of our senior management and any significant failure to attract and retain qualified personnel in a competitive labor market could limit our ability to execute our growth strategy, resulting in a slower rate of growth or a period of losses and/or negative cash flow.\nWe depend on the continued service of our senior management. Due to the nature of our business, we may have difficulty locating and hiring qualified personnel and retaining such personnel once hired. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, could limit our ability to execute our growth strategy resulting in a slower rate of growth.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and our election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our consolidated financial statements not being comparable to those of some other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our securities may be less attractive to investors.\nAs a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last completed fiscal year, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. In particular, as an emerging growth company we:\n\u25cf are not required to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on our management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u25cf are not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing how those elements fit with our principles and objectives;\n\u25cf are not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements;\n\u25cf are exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and Chief Executive Officer pay ratio disclosure;\n\u25cf may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;\n\u25cf are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act; and\n\u25cf will not be required to conduct an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting for two years.\nWe intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare our consolidated financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act.\nCertain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation and report regarding management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis, are not required to provide a pay-for-performance graph or CEO pay ratio disclosure, and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations disclosure.\nUnder the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act, or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. Under current SEC rules, however, we will continue to qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for so long as we have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $75 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive due to our reliance on these exemptions. If investors were to find our securities less attractive as a result of our election, we may have difficulty raising all of the proceeds we seek in this offering.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Series 1 Warrants, shares issued in acquisitions, and shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, or the market perceives that such sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could fall and we may be unable to sell our common stock in the future.\nOur common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which could lead to costly litigation for us and make an investment in us less appealing.\n\u25cf The market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf our business strategy and plans;\n\u25cf changing factors related to doing business in various jurisdictions within the United States;\n\u25cf new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines and timing of regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf general and industry-specific economic conditions;\n\u25cf additions to or departures of our key personnel;\n\u25cf variations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of other companies that operate in our business segments or in our industry;\n\u25cf lack of adequate trading liquidity;\n\u25cf announcements about our business partners;\n\u25cf changes in accounting principles; and\n\u25cf general market conditions.\nThe market prices of the securities of early-stage companies, particularly companies like ours without consistent product revenues and earnings, have been highly volatile and are likely to remain highly volatile in the future. This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In the past, companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities have often faced securities class action litigation. Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENT IN THE COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY\nThe Company\u2019s Common Stock currently trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cCETX\u201d. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s shares will continue to trade on NASDAQ in the future, and there can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop or be sustained. The market price of the shares of Common Stock is likely to be highly volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company\u2019s operating results, announcements of technological innovations, new products or new contracts by the Company or its competitors, developments with respect to proprietary rights, adoption of new government regulations affecting the environment, general market conditions and other factors. In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for the common stocks of technology companies. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nOur common stock has from time to time been \u201cthinly-traded.\u201d\nThe number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. Therefore, stockholders may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if they need to sell shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate their shares. Our \u201cthinly-traded\u201d stock is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give stockholders any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common shares will develop or be sustained, or that current trading levels will be sustained.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends.\nNo dividends have been paid on the common stock of the Company. The Company does not intend to pay cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future, and anticipates that profits, if any, received from operations will be devoted to the Company\u2019s future operations. Any decision to pay dividends will depend upon the Company\u2019s profitability at the time, cash available and other relevant factors.\nOur principal shareholder has significant influence over our Company which could make it impossible for the public stockholders to influence the affairs of the Company.\nWe are a \u201cControlled Company\u201d under exchange listing rules. Approximately 50.0% of our outstanding voting equity is beneficially held by combination of Aron Govil, the Company\u2019s former Chairman of the Board, and Saagar Govil the Company\u2019s CEO, as a result of this common stock ownership and the Series A preferred stock ownership by Mr. Aron Govil, the Company\u2019s management controls and will control in the future, substantially all matters requiring approval by the stockholders of the Company, including the election of all directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This makes it impossible for the public stockholders to influence the affairs of the Company.", "PERMNO": 15417, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "CETX"}
