{"cik": "863894", "company": "FEMALE HEALTH CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report and our other SEC filings, in considering our business and prospects. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nOur success is dependent upon the success of FC2.\nAt this time, we derive our revenues from sales of our only current product, FC2. The ultimate level of demand for FC2 is uncertain, and we may not be able to grow our business if demand for FC2 does not increase. We also depend on public sector agencies around the world to continue to include FC2 in their STI prevention and family planning programs, and on our commercial sector distribution partners to successfully market and distribute FC2. A decline in demand for FC2 would reduce our net revenues and profitability.\nOur business may be affected by contracting risks with government and other international health agencies.\nOur customers are primarily large international agencies and government health agencies which purchase and distribute FC2 for use in family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention programs. Sales to such agencies may be subject to government contracting risks, including the appropriations process and funding priorities, potential bureaucratic delays in awarding contracts under governmental tenders, process errors, politics or other pressures, and the risk that contracts may be subject to cancellation, delay, or restructuring. A governmental tender award indicates acceptance of the bidder\u2019s price rather than an order or guarantee of the purchase of any minimum number of units. Many governmental tenders are stated to be \u201cup to\u201d the maximum number of units, which gives the applicable government agency discretion to purchase less than the full maximum tender amount. As a result, government agencies may order and purchase fewer units than the full maximum tender amount and there are no guarantees as to the timing or amount of actual orders or shipments under government tenders. Orders received may vary from the amount of the tender award based on a number of factors, including vendor supply capacity, quality inspections, and changes in demand. These contracting risks may cause significant quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results and could adversely affect our net revenues and profitability. Budget issues, spending cuts, and global health spending priorities affecting government health agencies may also adversely affect demand for our product and our net revenues.\nCompetition from other products, including other female condoms, may have an adverse effect on our net revenues and profit margins.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures could have a negative effect on our net revenues and profit margins. Other parties have developed and marketed female condoms, although only one such product has WHO pre-clearance and none of these female condoms have been approved by the FDA. FDA approval is required to sell female condoms in the U.S., and WHO pre-clearance is required to sell female condoms to U.N. agencies. FC2 has also been competing with other female condoms in markets that do not require either FDA approval or WHO prequalification. We have experienced increasing competition in the global public sector, and competitors received part of the last two South African tenders. Increasing competition in FC2\u2019s markets may put pressure on pricing for FC2 or adversely affect sales of FC2, and some customers, particularly in the global public sector, may prioritize price over other features where FC2 may have an advantage. It is also possible that other companies will develop a female condom, and such companies could have greater financial resources and customer contacts than us. In addition, other contraceptive methods may compete with FC2 for funding and attention in the global public sector.\nWe may experience difficulties in implementing our growth initiatives.\nWe have announced new initiatives to increase our investment in sales and marketing activities. We may face a number of obstacles to successfully implement these initiatives, such as the costs associated with entering new markets or expanding current markets, retaining adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel, developing and implementing effective marketing efforts, and establishing and maintaining appropriate regulatory compliance. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in implementing our growth strategies or that such strategies, even if implemented, will lead to the successful achievement of our objectives. Even if we are able to increase our sales as a result of our growth initiatives, we may not be able to achieve an adequate return on the amount we invest in these initiatives.\nAn inability to identify or complete future acquisitions could adversely affect our future growth.\nAs part of our growth initiatives, we intend to pursue acquisitions of new products, technologies, and/or businesses that are complementary to FC2 and enable us to leverage our competitive strengths. While we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions, we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approval for acquisitions where required, or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. An inability to identify or complete future acquisitions could limit our future growth.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating strategic acquisitions.\nThe integration of acquired companies and their operations into our operations involves a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nthe acquired business may experience losses that could adversely affect our profitability;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated costs relating to the integration of acquired businesses may increase our expenses;\n\u00b7\npossible failure to accomplish the strategic objectives for an acquisition;\n\u00b7\nthe loss of key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in achieving planned cost-savings and synergies may increase our expenses or decrease our net revenues;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention could impair their ability to effectively manage our business operations;\n\u00b7\nthe acquired business may require significant expenditures for product development or regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nthe acquired business may lack adequate internal controls or have other issues with its financial systems;\n\u00b7\nthere may be regulatory compliance or other issues relating to the business practices of an acquired business;\n\u00b7\nwe may record goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential impairment charges and we may also incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets; and\n\u00b7\nunanticipated management or operational problems or liabilities may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nAdditionally, we may borrow funds or issue equity to finance strategic acquisitions. Debt leverage resulting from future acquisitions could adversely affect our operating margins and limit our ability to capitalize on future business opportunities. Such borrowings may also be subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Equity issuances may dilute our existing shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our shares.\nWe depend on four major customers for a significant portion of our net revenues.\nThe Company's four largest customers currently are UNFPA, USAID, Sekunjalo and Semina. UNFPA accounted for 18 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2015, 40 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2014, and 62 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2013. USAID accounted for 16 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2015, 17 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2014, and less than 10 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2013. Sekunjalo accounted for less than 10 percent unit sales in fiscal 2015, 13 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2014, and less than 10 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2013. Semina accounted for 47 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2015, and less than 10 percent of unit sales in fiscal 2014 and 2013. An adverse change in our relationship with our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and profitability. In addition, we may have a concentration of accounts receivable with one or more of our largest customers, and a delay in payment by a large customer could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\nSince we sell product in foreign markets, we are subject to international business risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur international operations subject us to risks, including:\n\u00b7\neconomic and political instability;\n\u00b7\nchanges in international regulatory requirements, import duties, or export restrictions, including limitations on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\ncomplications in complying with trade and foreign tax laws;\n\u00b7\nprice controls and other restrictions on foreign currency; and\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.\nAny of these risks might disrupt the supply of our products, increase our expenses or decrease our net revenues. The cost of compliance with trade and foreign tax laws increases our expenses, and actual or alleged violations of such laws could result in enforcement actions or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs.\nIncreases in the cost of raw materials, labor, and other costs used to manufacture our product could increase our cost of sales and reduce our gross margins.\nWe may experience increased costs of raw materials, including the nitrile polymer used in FC2, and increased labor costs. We may not be able to pass along such cost increases to our customers. As a result, an increase in the cost of raw materials, labor or other costs associated with manufacturing FC2 could increase our cost of sales and reduce our gross margins.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could increase our expenses.\nBecause we manufacture FC2 in a leased facility located in Malaysia, a portion of our operating costs are denominated in a foreign currency. While a material portion of our future sales of FC2 are likely to be in foreign markets, all sales of FC2 are denominated in U.S. dollars. Manufacturing costs are subject to normal currency risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Malaysian ringgit (MYR) relative to the U.S. dollar. Historically, we have not hedged our foreign currency risk.\nWe rely on a single facility to manufacture FC2, which subjects us to the risk of supply disruptions.\nWe manufacture FC2 in a single leased facility located in Malaysia. Difficulties encountered by this facility, such as fire, accident, natural disaster, or an outbreak of a contagious disease could halt or disrupt production at the facility, delay the completion of orders, or cause the cancellation of orders. Any of these risks could increase our expenses or reduce our net revenues.\nOur product is subject to substantial government regulation, which exposes us to risks that we will be fined or exposed to civil or criminal liability, receive negative publicity, or be prevented from selling our product.\nFC2 is subject to regulation by the FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and by foreign regulatory agencies. Under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance before they can be sold. FDA regulations also require us to adhere to \"Good Manufacturing Practices,\" which include testing, quality control, and documentation procedures. Our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies. If we fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could:\n\u00b7\nbe fined or exposed to civil or criminal liability;\n\u00b7\nface suspensions of clearances, seizures, or recalls of products or operating restrictions;\n\u00b7\nreceive negative publicity; or\n\u00b7\nbe prohibited from selling our product in the U.S. or in foreign markets.\nUncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions may negatively affect our business.\nIf general economic conditions in the U.S. and other global markets in which we operate decline, or if consumers fear that economic conditions will decline, consumers may reduce expenditures for products such as our product. Adverse changes may occur as a result of adverse global or regional economic conditions, fluctuating oil prices, declining consumer confidence, unemployment, fluctuations in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, or other factors affecting economic conditions generally. These changes may negatively affect the sales of our product, increase the cost, and decrease the availability of financing, or increase costs associated with producing and distributing our product. In addition, a substantial portion of the sales of FC2 are made in the public market to government agencies, including USAID and other government agencies around the world. Worsening economic conditions as well as budget deficits and austerity measures may cause pressures on government budgets and result in a reduction in purchases of FC2 by governmental agencies. Sales of our product fluctuate, which causes our operating results to vary from quarter-to-quarter.\nSales of our product fluctuate based upon demand from our commercial partners and the public sector and the nature of government procurement processes. Historically, our net revenues and profitability have varied from quarter-to-quarter due to such buying patterns. Quarterly variations in operating results may cause us to fail to meet our earnings guidance or market expectations for our operating results and may tend to depress our stock price during such quarters.\nMaterial adverse or unforeseen legal judgments, fines, penalties, or settlements could have an adverse impact on our profits and cash flows.\nWe may, from time to time, become a party to legal proceedings incidental to our business, including, but not limited to, alleged claims relating to product liability, environmental compliance, patent infringement, commercial disputes, and employment matters. Future litigation could require us to record reserves or make payments which could adversely affect our profits and cash flows. Even the successful defense of legal proceedings may cause us to incur substantial legal costs and may divert management's attention and resources away from our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property.\nWe rely on our patented and other proprietary technology relating to FC2. The actions taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our product, processes, or technology. We cannot assure you that our proprietary technology will not become known to competitors, or that others will not independently develop a substantially equivalent or better female condom that does not infringe on our intellectual property rights, or will not challenge or assert rights in, and ownership of, our patents and other proprietary rights.\nThere are provisions in our charter documents, Wisconsin law, and change of control agreements with our officers that might prevent or delay a change in control of our company.\nWe are subject to a number of provisions in our charter documents, Wisconsin law, and change of control agreements that may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe authority provided to our Board of Directors in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders;\n\u00b7\nchange of control agreements we have entered into with three of our employees which provide for up to three years of compensation following a change of control as defined in the agreements;\n\u00b7\nthe provision under Wisconsin law that permits shareholders to act by written consent only if such consent is unanimous;\n\u00b7\nthe provision under Wisconsin law that requires for a corporation such as us, that was formed before January 1, 1973, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our voting stock to approve an amendment to our articles of incorporation, a merger submitted to a vote of our shareholders, or a sale of substantially all of our assets; and\n\u00b7\nthe Wisconsin control share acquisition statute and Wisconsin's \"fair price\" and \"business combination\" provisions which limit the ability of an acquiring person to engage in certain transactions or to exercise the full voting power of acquired shares under certain circumstances.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may become volatile again in the future. The trading price of our common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour failure to meet market expectations for our performance;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of announcements by us or our competitors concerning significant product developments, acquisitions, or financial performance;\n\u00b7\nfluctuation in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial sales of our common stock;\n\u00b7\ngeneral stock market conditions; or\n\u00b7\nother economic or external factors.\nYou may be unable to sell your stock at or above your purchase price.", "PERMNO": 76461, "SIC": 3060, "TIC": "VERU"}
