{"cik": "9389", "company": "BALL Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAny of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Rexam, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Rexam will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate our beverage packaging business with Rexam\u2019s business. Combining two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the company and the Rexam business we acquired. The integration process may disrupt the combined business and, if implemented ineffectively, could preclude the realization of the full benefits of the acquisition that are currently expected. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the company and could adversely affect the company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships and diversion of management\u2019s attention. The possible difficulties of combining the operations of the companies also include, among others:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from combining our business with that of Rexam;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in integrating operations, business practices and systems;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in assimilating and retaining employees;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex combined company;\n\u00b7\nchallenges in retaining existing customers and suppliers;\n\u00b7\nchallenges in obtaining new customers and suppliers;\n\u00b7\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the acquisition; and\n\u00b7\nchallenges in retaining and attracting key personnel.\nMany of these factors are or will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the company. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses of the company and Rexam are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect, or the full benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of the company and Rexam. All of these factors could adversely affect the earnings of the company, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition, or negatively impact the price of the company\u2019s common stock. As a result, we cannot assure that the combination of the company\u2019s and Rexam\u2019s beverage packaging businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the acquisition.\nIn connection with satisfying requirements under the antitrust laws of the U.S., the European Union and Brazil, and obtaining associated approvals and clearances, we were required to effect significant divestitures. As a result of the required divestitures, we may not realize all or a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of the Rexam acquisition, including anticipated synergies, and the company may otherwise suffer other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect the company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and, to the extent that the current price of the company\u2019s common stock reflects an assumption that the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will be realized, the price per share for the company\u2019s common stock could be negatively impacted.\nWe have a significant level of debt that could have important consequences for our business and any investment in our securities.\nThe company had $6.7 billion of interest-bearing debt at December 31, 2018. Such indebtedness could have significant consequences for our business and any investment in our securities, including:\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u00b7\nrequiring more of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, limiting our cash flow available to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities or returning additional cash to our shareholders;\n\u00b7\nrestricting us from making additional acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nOur business, operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world.\nWe may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Moreover, overcapacity, which often leads to lower prices, exists in certain regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows. Our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate long-term strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability.\nThe loss of a key customer, or a reduction in its requirements, could have a significant negative impact on our sales.\nWe sell a majority of our packaging products to a relatively limited number of major beverage, personal care and household product companies, some of which operate in multiple geographical markets we serve.\nAlthough the majority of our customer contracts are long-term, these contracts, unless they are renewed, expire in accordance with their respective terms and are terminable under certain circumstances, such as our failure to meet quality, volume or market pricing requirements. Because we depend on a relatively limited number of major customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers, a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers, a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers\u2019 employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers.\nThe primary customers for our aerospace segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors. Our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks, including funding cuts and delays, technical uncertainties, budget changes, government shutdowns, competitive activity and changes in scope.\nWe face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability.\nCompetition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense. Increases in productivity, combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry, have maintained competitive pricing pressures. The principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price, innovation, sustainability, service and quality. In the aerospace industry, they are technical capability, cost and schedule. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources, and some may currently have excess capacity. Our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours. The global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances, which, in turn, could increase these competitive pressures.\nWe are subject to competition from alternative products, which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows.\nOur metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products, particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from PET, single serve beer bottles and other beverage containers made of glass, cardboard or other materials. Competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the U.S., Europe and the PRC. Certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products and solutions. There can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products, which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow.\nOur packaging businesses have a narrow product range, and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased or if decreases occur in the demand for the beverages and other goods filled in our products.\nThe majority of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of beverage containers, and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of beverage containers. Our business would suffer if the use of beverage containers decreased. Accordingly, broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success. If demand for glass and PET bottles increases relative to metal containers, or the demand for aluminum containers does not develop as expected, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, which have been increasing in number and complexity. Each of our, and their, facilities is subject to federal, state, provincial and local licensing and regulation by health, environmental, workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions. Requirements of worldwide governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing, manufacturing facility locations within the jurisdiction, product content and safety, climate change, workplace safety and health, environmental, expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products, and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products. In addition, we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of numerous and complex federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations.\nEnacted regulatory developments regarding the reporting and use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing, availability and price of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict-free materials, and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to obtain such products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, because our supply chains are complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all materials used in the products that we sell. The compliance and reporting aspects of these regulations may result in incremental costs to the company. While deposit systems and other container-related legislation have been adopted in some jurisdictions, similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others. We anticipate that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future. The packages we produce are widely used and perform well in U.S. states, Canadian provinces and European countries that have deposit systems, as well as in other countries worldwide.\nSignificant environmental, employment-related and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving. The compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial, and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations.\nWe derived more than 50 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2018. The sizeable scope of operations outside of the U.S. may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business. Reasons for this include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u00b7\ngovernments\u2019 restrictive trade policies;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition or rescission of duties, taxes or government royalties;\n\u00b7\nexchange rate risks;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights; and\n\u00b7\nthe geographic, language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world.\nWe are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe financial results of the company are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increased proportion of assets, liabilities and earnings denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. The company presents its financial statements in U.S. dollars and has a significant proportion of its net assets, debt and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the euro, as well as the Russian ruble and other emerging market currencies. The company\u2019s financial results and capital ratios are therefore sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates.\nWe manage our exposure to currency fluctuations, particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes. We primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our currency exposures and, as a result, we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset, in part, by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities.\nIf we fail to retain key management and personnel, we may be unable to implement our key objectives.\nWe believe our future success depends, in part, on our experienced management team. Unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession and/or compensation planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives.\nDecreases in our ability to develop or apply new technology and know-how may affect our competitiveness.\nOur success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services. We must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs. If we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products through research and development or licensing of new technology, we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAdverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales.\nWe manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages. Unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers. Climate change could have various effects on the demand for our products and the costs of inputs to our production in different regions around the world.\nWe are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials.\nWe purchase aluminum, steel and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources. While all such materials are available from independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors, including general economic conditions, commodity price fluctuations (particularly aluminum on the London Metal Exchange), the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials. Although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk, we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices. Economic, operational and financial factors, as well as governmental action, could impact our suppliers, thereby causing supply shortages. Increases in raw material costs, including potential increases due to tariffs, sanctions, or other trade actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In the Americas, Europe and Asia, some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk. Our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase. Due to the fixed-price contracts and derivative activities, while increasing raw material costs may not impact our near-term profitability, increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time.\nProlonged work stoppages at facilities with union employees could jeopardize our financial position.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 14 percent of our North American packaging facility employees and 56 percent of our European employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years. Although we consider our employee relations to be generally good, a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us.\nOur aerospace segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business.\nIn our aerospace business, U.S. government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements, and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions. In such instances, Ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination.\nIn addition, budgetary constraints and government shutdowns may result in further reductions to projected spending levels by the U.S. government. In particular, government expenditures are subject to the potential for automatic reductions, generally referred to as \u201csequestration.\u201d Sequestration may occur in any given year, resulting in significant additional reductions to spending by various U.S government defense and aerospace agencies on both existing and new contracts, as well as the disruption of ongoing programs. Even if sequestration does not occur, we expect that budgetary constraints and ongoing concerns regarding the U.S. national debt will continue to place downward pressure on agency spending levels. Due to these and other factors, overall spending on various programs could decline, which could result in significant reductions to revenue, cash flows, net earnings and backlog primarily in our aerospace segment.\nWe use estimates in accounting for many of our programs in our aerospace business, and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.\nWe account for sales and profits on a portion of long-term contracts in our aerospace business in accordance with the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, using the cost-to-cost method to account for updates in estimates. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events, including the quantity and timing of product deliveries, future labor performance and rates, and material and overhead costs. These assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements. Under the cost-to-cost method, the impact of updates in our estimates related to units shipped to date or progress made to date is recognized immediately.\nBecause of the significance of the judgments and estimates described above, it is likely that we could record materially different amounts if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances or estimates were to change.\nOur backlog includes both cost-type and fixed-price contracts. Cost-type contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken, the nature of the work performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees. The fixed-price contracts could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate.\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a U.S. government audit or investigation.\nOur aerospace business operates in a highly regulated environment and is routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. government and its agencies, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). These agencies review performance under our contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies. Business systems that are subject to review under the DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) are purchasing, estimating, material management and accounting, as well as property and earned value management. Any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. Whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the U.S. government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. If such actions were to result in suspension or debarment, this could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to environmental hazards, such as emissions to air, discharges to water, the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the clean-up of hazardous substances. We have been designated, along with numerous other companies, as a potentially responsible party for the clean-up of several hazardous waste sites. Based on available information, we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position. There is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide.\nOur business faces the potential of increased regulation on some of the raw materials utilized in our packaging operations.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to some of the raw materials, such as epoxy-based coatings utilized in our container making process. Epoxy-based coatings may contain Bisphenol-A (BPA). Scientific evidence evaluated by regulatory agencies in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand has consistently shown these coatings to be safe for food contact at current levels, and these regulatory agencies have stated that human exposure to BPA from epoxy-based container coatings is well below safe exposure limits set by government bodies worldwide. A significant change in these regulatory agency statements, adverse information concerning BPA, or rulings made within certain federal, state, provincial and local jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Ball recognizes that significant interest exists in non-epoxy based coatings, and we have been proactively working with coatings suppliers and our customers to transition to alternative coatings.\nNet earnings and net assets could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. We are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill. The recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units. Fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows and discount rates. If general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business, we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of reporting units. This decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance, which could materially affect our U.S. GAAP net earnings and net assets.\nWe continue to see the industry supply of beverage packaging exceed demand in China, resulting in significant pricing pressure and negative impacts on the profitability of our beverage packaging, Asia Pacific, reporting unit. The worsening business climate in Saudi Arabia has resulted in negative impacts to the profitability of our beverage packaging, AMEA, reporting unit. If it becomes an expectation that these situations will continue for an extended period of time, it may result in a noncash impairment of some or all of the goodwill associated with these reporting units, totaling $78 million and $100 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018. The company\u2019s annual goodwill impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 indicated the estimated fair value of the beverage packaging, Asia Pacific, and beverage packaging, AMEA, reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill, by 11 percent and 15 percent, respectively. The goodwill associated with the beverage packaging, Asia Pacific, reporting unit predominantly relates to the China beverage packaging facilities. On December 13, 2018, we announced an agreement to sell our beverage packaging facilities in China. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2019.\nIf the investments in Ball\u2019s pension plans, or in the multi-employer pension plans in which Ball participates, do not perform as expected, we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans, which would otherwise be available for other general corporate purposes.\nBall maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its North American employees and a significant portion of United Kingdom employees, which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions. The plans\u2019 assets consist primarily of common stocks, fixed-income securities and, in the U.S., alternative investments. Market declines, longevity increases or legislative changes, such as the Pension Protection Act in the U.S., could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time, and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders\u2019 equity. Additional risks exist related to the company\u2019s participation in multi-employer pension plans. Assets contributed to a multi-employer pension plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer in a multi-employer pension plan stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participants. This could result in increases to our contributions to the plans as well as pension expense.\nRestricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our short-term liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures.\nA reduction in global market liquidity could:\n\u00b7\nrestrict our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business activities;\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including the credit risks stemming from the economic environment;\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; and\n\u00b7\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay cash dividends or refinance debt maturities.\nAs market interest rates increase, our variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which adversely affects our cash flow. While we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk.\nThe global credit, financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nThe overall credit, financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations, including:\n\u00b7\nthe creditworthiness of customers, suppliers and counterparties could deteriorate resulting in a financial loss or a disruption in our supply of raw materials;\n\u00b7\nvolatile market performance could affect the fair value of our pension assets, potentially requiring us to make significant additional contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to maintain prescribed funding levels;\n\u00b7\na significant weakening of our financial position or operating results could result in noncompliance with our debt covenants; and\n\u00b7\nreduced cash flow from our operations could adversely affect our ability to execute our long-term strategy to increase liquidity, reduce debt, repurchase our stock and invest in our businesses.\nChanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and SEC rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results.\nU.S. GAAP and SEC accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past several years. These changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods. Additionally, material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate Ball and ultimately impact our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner.\nEarnings and cash flows can be impacted by changes in tax laws.\nAs a U.S.-based multinational business, the company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. The relevant tax rules and regulations are complex, often changing and, in some cases, are interdependent. If these or other tax rules and regulations should change, the company\u2019s earnings and cash flows could be impacted.\nIn particular, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, may continue to result in fluctuations in the company\u2019s net earnings and cash flows. The Act introduced major changes to U.S. income tax law that require significant judgment to interpret the impact of the provisions of the Act on the company\u2019s financial results.\nDue to the timing of its enactment and the complexity associated with the provisions of the Act, the company made reasonable estimates of its effects where possible and recorded provisional estimates in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The company has updated these provisional estimates as needed and its financial statements now reflect the final impact of these items based on currently available guidance, including proposed regulations. Given the various uncertainties and ambiguities that still remain with respect to the application of the Act, the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department may issue subsequent guidance on the provisions of the Act, including final regulations, that differs from our current interpretations. The impact of any adjustments required as a result of such subsequent guidance could materially affect the company\u2019s financial results.\nThe company\u2019s worldwide provision for income taxes is determined, in part, through the use of significant estimates and judgments. Numerous transactions arise in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The company undergoes tax examinations by various worldwide tax authorities on a regular basis. While the company believes its estimates of its tax obligations are reasonable, the final outcome after the conclusion of any tax examinations and any litigation could be materially different from what has been reflected in the company\u2019s historical financial statements.\nIncreased information technology (IT) security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services.\nThe company\u2019s IT systems, or any third party\u2019s system on which the company relies, could fail on their own accord or may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions or shutdowns, including interruptions or shutdowns due to natural disasters, power outages or telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks or failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software or hardware. Increased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime also pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. As a provider of products and services to government and commercial customers, our aerospace business in particular may be the target of cyber-attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to classified or sensitive information and networks. The company has a number of shared service centers where many of the company\u2019s IT systems are concentrated and any disruption at such a location could impact the company\u2019s business within the operating zones served by the impacted service center.\nWhile we attempt to mitigate all of these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats or other IT disruptions. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, harm to individuals or property, contractual or regulatory actions and fines, penalties and potential liabilities, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. Data privacy and protection laws are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which may increase our costs, affect our competitiveness and could expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. In addition, a security breach that involves classified or other sensitive government information could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and could result in the loss of our secure facility clearance and other accreditation, loss of our government contracts, loss of access to classified information or debarment as a government contractor.\nA material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If a material weakness is identified, management could conclude that internal control over financial reporting is not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in \u201cInternal Control-An Integrated Framework (2013).\u201d If a material weakness is identified, a remediation plan would be designed to address the material weakness. If remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses in internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. As of December 31, 2018, the company had no material weaknesses.\nSignificant developments stemming from the U.K.\u2019s referendum on membership in the EU could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the European Union (EU). This referendum has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the U.K. and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years, particularly as the U.K. and the EU continue to negotiate the terms of withdrawal from the EU. Our business in the U.K., the EU and worldwide could be affected by uncertainty prior to and after the upcoming March 29, 2019, withdrawal date by the impact of the U.K.\u2019s referendum and anticipated withdrawal from the EU. There are many ways in which our business could be affected, only some of which we can identify at the present time, such as supply chain constraints, increased material costs due to rising tariffs, effects on employee mobility and increased costs of doing business in the U.K. These effects could be more severe if the U.K. and the EU fail to reach an agreement prior to the withdrawal date.\nThe referendum, and the likely withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU it triggers, has caused and, along with events that could occur in the future as a consequence of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal, including the possible breakup of the U.K. or the EU, may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets, including in global currency and debt markets. A failure by the U.K. and the EU to reach an agreement prior to the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU, scheduled for March 29, 2019, may increase this volatility. This volatility could cause a slowdown in economic activity in the U.K., Europe or globally, which could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects. In addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the U.K. and other countries, including the U.S., and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the U.K. These possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the U.K.\u2019s actual or threatened withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.", "PERMNO": 57568, "SIC": 3411, "TIC": "BLL"}
