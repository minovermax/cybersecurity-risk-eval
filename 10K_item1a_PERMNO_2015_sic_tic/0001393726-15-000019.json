{"cik": "1393726", "company": "TIPTREE FINANCIAL INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nTiptree is subject to certain risks and uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business, results of operations and financial condition. In October, 2014, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell PFG and that sale is expected to close during the third quarter of 2015. However, we cannot assure you of the timing of the sale or whether it will occur. Accordingly, the PFG business is discussed in these Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to our Businesses\nWe operate in highly competitive markets for business opportunities and personnel, which could impede our growth and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets for business opportunities in each of our operating segments. Many of our competitors have financial, personnel and other resources that are greater than ours and may be better able to react to market conditions. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully competing for future business opportunities and personnel, which could impede our growth and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions may have an adverse effect on us, including due to the failure to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities for strategic growth through acquisitions. Acquired companies and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require greater than expected financial and other resources. In addition, potential issues associated with acquisitions could include, among other things:\n\u2022\nour ability to realize the full extent of the benefits, synergies or cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of the completion of an acquisition within the anticipated time frame, or at all;\n\u2022receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with the acquisition;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from other strategies and objectives;\n\u2022motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; and\n\u2022\nconforming and integrating financial reporting, standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures.\nIf an acquisition is not successfully completed or integrated into our existing operations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely effected.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future or may need to refinance existing indebtedness, but there is no assurance that such capital will be available on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in order to grow our business or fund our strategy or acquisitions. Additional financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing stockholders if raised through additional equity offerings. Additionally, any securities issued to raise such funds may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, our ability to expand, develop or enhance our subsidiaries\u2019 services and products, enter new markets, consummate acquisitions or respond to competitive pressures could be materially limited.\nThe amount of required statutory capital of our insurance subsidiaries can increase because of factors outside of our control.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutory capital and reserve requirements established by the applicable insurance regulators based on risk-based capital formulas. In any particular year, these requirements may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, most of which are outside our control, such as the amount of statutory income or losses generated, changes in equity market levels, the value of fixed-income and equity securities in the subsidiary\u2019s investment portfolio, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as changes to the risk-based capital formulas used by insurance regulators. Increases in the amount of additional statutory reserves that our insurance subsidiaries are required to hold can adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA downgrade in our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 claims paying ability or financial strength ratings could increase policy surrenders and withdrawals, adversely affecting relationships with distributors and reducing new policy sales.\nClaims paying ability ratings, sometimes referred to as financial strength ratings, indicate a rating agency\u2019s view of an insurance company\u2019s ability to meet its obligations to its policy holders. These ratings are therefore key factors underlying the competitive position of insurers. Some distributors of insurance products may choose not to do business with insurance companies that are rated below certain financial strength ratings. Fortegra currently has a rating of \u201cA-\u201d from A.M. Best Company, Inc. Each of PFLAC and PFLAC NY currently have a rating of \u201cA-\u201d from A.M. Best Company, Inc. Rating agencies can be expected to continue to monitor our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 financial strength and claims paying ability, and no assurances can be given that future ratings downgrades will not occur, whether due to changes in their performance, changes in rating agencies\u2019 industry views or ratings methodologies, or a combination of such factors. A ratings downgrade or the potential for such a downgrade in a rating could, to the extent applicable to a particular type of policy, materially increase the number of policy surrenders or withdrawals by policyholders of cash values from their policies, adversely affect relationships with distributors of insurance products, reduce new policy sales and adversely affect our ability to compete in the insurance industry.\nOur insurance subsidiaries may incur losses if reinsurers are unwilling or unable to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts.\nFortegra reinsures a substantial portion of the risks underwritten through third party reinsurance companies. Our insurance subsidiaries use reinsurance to reduce the severity and incidence of claims costs, and to provide relief with regard to certain reserves. As of December 31, 2014, substantially all of the mortality risk on the insurance policies issued by PFG was reinsured by third parties. Under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of the insurers\u2019 losses and related expenses; however, the insurer remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Consequently, reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims and we assume credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. The inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFortegra\u2019s reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal. Fortegra may not be able to maintain its current reinsurance facilities and its clients may not be able to continue to operate their captive reinsurance companies. As a result, even where highly desirable or necessary, Fortegra may not be able to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If Fortegra is unable to renew its expiring facilities or to obtain or structure new reinsurance facilities, either its net exposures would increase or, if it is unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, it may have to reduce the level of its underwriting commitments. Either of these potential developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance subsidiaries\u2019 actual claims losses may exceed their reserves for claims, which may require them to establish additional reserves that may materially and adversely affect their business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance subsidiaries maintain reserves to cover their estimated ultimate exposure for claims with respect to reported claims and incurred but not reported claims as of the end of each accounting period. Reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or statutory accounting principles, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure. Instead, they represent our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections, of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for a claim or group of claims, based on our assessment of facts and circumstances known at the time of calculation. The adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by external factors such as changes in the economic cycle, unemployment, changes in the social perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability, emerging health issues, new methods of treatment or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes, as well as changes in claims handling procedures. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the statement\nof income of the period in which such estimates are updated. Because the establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, we can give no assurances that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves. In general, future loss development could require reserves to be increased, which could have a material adverse effect on our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFortegra may lose clients or business as a result of consolidation within the financial services industry.\nThere has been considerable consolidation in the financial services industry, driven primarily by the acquisition of small and mid-size organizations by larger entities. We expect this trend to continue. Fortegra may lose business or suffer decreased revenues if one or more of its significant clients or distributors consolidate or align themselves with other companies. To date, Fortegra\u2019s business has not been materially affected by consolidation. However, it may be affected by industry consolidation that occurs in the future, particularly if any of its significant clients are acquired by organizations that already possess the operations, services and products that it provides.\nFortegra is dependent on independent financial institutions, lenders and retailers for distribution of its products and services, and the loss of these distribution sources, or their failure to sell Fortegra\u2019s products and services could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFortegra is dependent on financial institutions, lenders and retailers to distribute its products and services and its revenue is dependent on the level of business conducted by such distributors as well as the effectiveness of their sales efforts, each of which is beyond Fortegra\u2019s control because such distributors typically do not have any minimum performance or sales requirements. Further, although its contracts with these distributors are typically exclusive, they can be canceled on relatively short notice. Therefore, Fortegra\u2019s growth is dependent, in part, on its ability to identify and attract new distribution relationships and successfully implement its information systems with those of its new distributors. The impairment of Fortegra\u2019s distribution relationships, the loss of a significant number of its distribution relationships, the failure to establish new distribution relationships, the failure to offer increasingly competitive products, the increase in sales of competitors\u2019 services and products by these distributors or the decline in their overall business activity or the effectiveness of their sales of Fortegra\u2019s products could materially reduce Fortegra\u2019s sales and revenues and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDue to the structure of some of Fortegra\u2019s commissions, it is exposed to risks related to the creditworthiness of some of its agents.\nFortegra is subject to the credit risk of some of the agents with which it contracts to sell its products and services. Fortegra typically advances agents\u2019 commissions as part of its product offerings. These advances are a percentage of the premiums charged. If Fortegra over-advances such commissions to agents, the agents may not be able to fulfill their payback obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on Fortegra\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nOur information systems may fail or their security may be compromised, which could damage our business and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance and insurance services business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our information systems and our ability to store, retrieve, process and manage significant databases and expand and upgrade our information systems. We rely on these systems throughout our businesses for a variety of functions, including marketing and selling our products and services, performing our services, managing our operations, processing claims and applications, providing information to clients, performing actuarial analyses and maintaining financial records. The interruption or loss of our information processing capabilities through the loss of stored data, programming errors, the breakdown or malfunctioning of computer equipment or software systems, telecommunications failure or damage caused by weather or natural disasters or any other significant disruptions could harm our business, ability to generate revenues, client relationships, competitive position and reputation. In addition, our information systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses or other attacks which could disable our information systems and our security measures may not prevent such attacks. The failure of our systems as a result of any security breaches, intrusions or attacks could cause significant interruptions to our operations, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA reduction in fees paid to TAMCO could adversely affect our profitability.\nTAMCO generates management, servicing and advisory fees based on the amount of assets managed, and in certain cases, on the returns generated by the assets managed. A reduction in fees paid to TAMCO, due to termination of management agreements, reduction in assets managed (for example as a result of exercise of optional call provisions by subordinated noteholders) or lower than expected returns, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur real estate operating entities expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ownership of real estate operating entities exposes us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, thereby reducing our profitability. These operational risks include fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to achieve economic resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), rent control regulations, increases in the cost of food, materials, energy, labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise) or other services, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, professional and general liability claims, and the availability and cost of professional and general liability insurance. Any one or a combination of these factors could result in operating deficiencies in our operating assets, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLiability relating to environmental matters may decrease the value of our real estate assets.\nUnder various federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of cleanup of certain hazardous substances released on or under its property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. The presence of hazardous substances may adversely affect an owner\u2019s ability to sell real estate or borrow using real estate as collateral. To the extent that any of our owned real estate encounters environmental issues, it may adversely affect the value of that real estate. Further, in regard to any mortgage investment, if the owner of the underlying property becomes liable for cleanup costs, the ability of the owner to make debt payments may be reduced, which in turn may adversely affect the value of the relevant mortgage asset held by us. In addition, in certain instances, we may be liable for the cost of any required remediation or clean up.\nViolation of fraud and abuse laws applicable to our real estate tenants, lessees and operators may jeopardize a tenant\u2019s, lessee\u2019s or operator\u2019s ability to make payments to us.\nThe federal government and numerous state governments have passed laws and regulations that attempt to eliminate healthcare fraud and abuse by prohibiting business arrangements that induce patient referrals or inappropriately influence the ordering of specific ancillary services. In addition, numerous federal laws have continued to strengthen the federal fraud and abuse laws to provide for broader interpretations of prohibited conduct and stiffer penalties for violations. Violations of these laws may result in the imposition of criminal and civil penalties, including possible exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs. Imposition of any of these penalties upon any of our tenants, lessees or operators could jeopardize their ability to operate a facility or to make payments to us, thereby potentially adversely affecting us, or our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the past several years, federal and state governments have significantly increased investigation and enforcement activity to detect and eliminate fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, legislation and regulations have been adopted at state and federal levels, which severely restricts the ability of physicians to refer patients to entities in which they have a financial interest. It is anticipated that the trend toward increased investigation and enforcement activity in the area of fraud and abuse, as well as self-referrals, will continue in future years and could adversely affect our prospective tenants, lessees or operators and their operations, and in turn their ability to make payments to us.\nOur use of joint ventures for investments may limit our flexibility with respect to such jointly owned investments and could, thereby, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to sell these joint venture interests.\nWe have invested in joint ventures for real estate investments with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures and may form additional joint ventures to invest in real estate and other assets in the future. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to the risks that:\n\u2022\nwe could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes;\n\u2022\nour joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives, including the timing, terms and strategies for any investments;\n\u2022\nour joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as joint venture partners, which may require us to infuse our own capital into such venture(s) on behalf of the joint venture partner(s) despite other competing uses for such capital;\n\u2022\nour joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues;\n\u2022\nany sale or other disposition of our interest in a joint venture may require consents which we may not be able to obtain;\n\u2022\nsuch transactions may also trigger other contractual rights held by a joint venture partner, lender or other third party depending on how the transaction is structured; and\n\u2022\nthere may be disagreements as to whether consents and/or approvals are required in connection with the consummation of a particular transaction with a joint venture partner, lender and/or other third party, or whether such transaction triggers other contractual rights held by a joint venture partner, lender and/or other third party, and in either case, those disagreements may result in litigation.\nWe may be limited in the future in utilizing net operating losses incurred during prior periods to offset taxable income.\nCare and PFG previously incurred net operating losses. In the event that we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, including as a result of the Contribution Transactions or the exchange by TFP\u2019s limited partners of their partnership units in TFP for Tiptree Financial Class A common stock in 2014, our ability to use those net operating losses to offset taxable income could be subject to an annual limitation. The annual limitation would be equal to a percentage of our equity value at the time the ownership change occurred. In general, such an \u201cownership change\u201d would occur if the percentage of our stock owned by one or more 5% stockholders were to increase by 50 percentage points during any three-year period. A 5% stockholder is a person (including certain groups of persons acting in concert) that owns at least 5% of our stock. All stockholders that own less than 5% of our stock are treated as a single 5% stockholder. In addition, the Treasury Regulations under Section 382 of the Code contain additional rules the effect of which is to make it more likely that an ownership change could be deemed to occur. Accordingly, our ability to use prior net operating losses to offset future taxable income would be subject to a limitation if we experience an ownership change.\nA portion of our assets are illiquid or have limited liquidity, which may limit our ability to sell those assets at favorable prices or at all and creates uncertainty in connection with valuing such assets.\nOur assets include real estate, non-controlling interests in credit assets and related equity interests which may be illiquid or have limited liquidity. It may be difficult for us to dispose of assets with limited liquidity rapidly, or at favorable prices, if at all. In addition, assets with limited liquidity may be more difficult to value and may be sold at a substantial discount or experience more volatility than more liquid assets. We may not be able to dispose of assets at the carrying value reflected in our financial statements. Our results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our illiquid assets are materially higher than the values ultimately realized upon their disposal.\nWe leverage our assets and a decline in the fair value of such assets may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe leverage our assets, including through borrowings, generally through warehouse credit facilities, secured loans, derivative instruments such as total return swaps, securitizations (including the issuance of CLOs) and other borrowings. A rapid decline in the fair value of our leveraged assets, such as the declines experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008, may adversely affect us. Lenders may require us to post additional collateral to support the borrowing. If we cannot post the additional collateral, we may have to rapidly liquidate assets, which we may be unable to do on favorable terms or at all. Even after liquidating assets, we may still be unable to post the required collateral, further harming our liquidity and subjecting us to liability to lenders for the declines in the fair values of the collateral. A reduction in credit availability may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 assets are subject to credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, credit spread risk, selection risk, call and redemption risk and/or tax risk, and any one of these risks may materially and adversely affect the value of our assets, our results of operations and our financial condition.\nSome of our assets, including our direct investments, are subject to credit risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit spread risk, selection risk, call and redemption risk and refinancing risk.\nCredit risk is the risk that the obligor will be unable to pay scheduled principal and/or interest payments. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our income and realized gains or result in the recognition of losses. The fair value of our assets may be materially and adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in our direct investments and by other factors that may result in the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the fair value of our assets.\nWith respect to fixed-rate instruments, interest rate risk is the risk that the market value of such instruments will change in response to changes in the interest rate environment or other developments that may affect the fixed income market generally. When market interest rates go up, the market value of existing fixed rate instruments goes down and instruments with longer maturities are typically affected more by changes in interest rates than instruments with shorter maturities. Because market interest rates continue to be near their lowest levels in many years, there is a greater risk that prevailing interest rates will increase in the future causing these instruments to decline in market value.\nWith respect to floating-rate instruments, interest rate risk is the risk that defaults on such instruments will increase during periods of rising interest rates and that during periods of declining interest rates, obligors may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled.\nMarket risk is the risk that one or more markets to which the assets relate will decline in value, including the possibility that such markets will deteriorate sharply and unpredictably, which will likely impair the market value of the related instruments.\nCredit spread risk is the risk that the market value of fixed income instruments will change in response to changes in perceived or actual credit risk beyond changes that would be attributable to changes, if any, in interest rates.\nCall and redemption risk is the risk that debt instruments will be called or redeemed prior to maturity at a time when yields on other debt instruments in which the call or redemption proceeds could be invested are lower than the yield on the called or redeemed instrument.\nRefinancing risk is the risk that we will be unable to refinance some or all of our indebtedness or that any refinancing will not be on terms as favorable as those of our existing indebtedness, which could increase our funding costs, limit our ability to borrow, or result in a sale of the leveraged asset on disadvantageous terms. Any one of these risks may materially and adversely affect the value of our assets, our results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur risk mitigation or hedging strategies could result in our experiencing significant losses that may materially adversely affect us.\nWe pursue risk mitigation and hedging strategies to seek to reduce our exposure to losses from adverse credit events, interest rate changes and other risks. These strategies include short Treasury positions, interest rate swaps, credit derivative swaps, CDX derivative index positions, buying and selling credit protection on different tranches of risk in differing CDX indexes and derivative hedging instruments. Since we account for derivatives at fair market value, changes in fair market value are reflected in net income other than derivative hedging instruments which are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders\u2019 equity. Some of these strategies could result in our experiencing significant losses that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions.\nDemand for our products and services may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market, and fixed income volatility or other negative economic factors that are out of our control. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to manage normal commercial relationships with customers, counterparties and creditors which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Structure\nBecause we are a holding company, our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends to stockholders will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries that may be subject to restrictions.\nWe are a holding company and do not have any significant operations of our own. Our ability to meet our obligations will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries. The amount of dividends and other distributions that our subsidiaries may distribute to us may be subject to restrictions imposed by state law, restrictions that may be imposed by state regulators and restrictions imposed by the terms of any current or future indebtedness that these subsidiaries may incur. Such restrictions would also affect our ability to pay dividends to stockholders, if and when we choose to do so. We did not pay any cash dividends on our common stock in fiscal 2014.\nOur regulated insurance company subsidiaries are required to satisfy minimum capital and surplus requirements according to the laws and regulations of the states in which they operate, which regulate the amount of dividends and distributions we receive from them. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed \u201cextraordinary\u201d and require insurance regulatory approval. Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is generally required, are limited to amounts determined by a formula, which varies by state. Some states have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus. States also regulate transactions between our insurance company subsidiaries and us or our other subsidiaries, such as those relating to the shared services, and in some instances, require prior approval of such transactions within the holding company structure. If insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance company subsidiaries to us or our other subsidiaries (such as payments for employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, the regulators may block or otherwise restrict such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. In addition, there could be future regulatory actions restricting the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends or share services.\nTermination of our Transition Services Agreement or the Administrative Services Agreement could materially increase our costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nPursuant to a Transition Services Agreement, we pay fees to Tricadia for the services of Michael Barnes, our Executive Chairman, Julia Wyatt, our Chief Operating Officer, and for certain back office, administrative, information technology, insurance, legal and accounting services. A portion of the services that Tricadia provides to us are in turn provided to Tricadia by Mariner pursuant to a services agreement that may be terminated by Tricadia or Mariner without our consent. In addition, pursuant to an Administrative Services Agreement, a subsidiary of Mariner provides certain back office services to us directly for a fee. If any of the Transition Services Agreement, Tricadia\u2019s services agreement with Mariner or the Administrative Services Agreement is terminated, we would be required to make alternative arrangements for the performance of these services. We may not be able to obtain these services promptly or at reasonable rates or at all, and our costs of obtaining such services could materially increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSome of our officers and directors currently or may in the future act as members, managers, officers, directors or employees of entities with conflicting business strategies.\nSome of our officers and directors currently or may in the future act as members, managers, officers, directors or employees of entities with business strategies that may conflict with our business strategies. Michael Barnes, our Executive Chairman, is a founding partner and Co-Chief Investment Officer of Tricadia Holdings, L.P., an asset management holding company which we refer to as \u201cTricadia\u201d, and Executive Chairman and a member of the board of directors of TFP. Tricadia\u2019s subsidiaries include, and Mr. Barnes is co-chief investment officer of, companies that manage hedge funds, private equity funds and structured vehicles with business strategies that may compete with ours. Furthermore, Geoffrey Kauffman, our Co-Chief Executive Officer, is the Co-Chief Executive Officer of TFP and is a limited partner of Tricadia. Julia Wyatt, our Chief Operating Officer, is the Chief Financial Officer of Tricadia and the Chief Operating Officer of TFP and is also a limited partner of Tricadia. Jonathan Ilany, our Co-Chief Executive Officer, is a limited partner of Mariner, which is a stockholder of Tiptree Financial and provides certain back office services to Tiptree. Such positions may give rise to actual or potential conflicts of interest, which may not be resolved in a manner that is in the best interests of the Company or the best interests of its stockholders.\nOur duties as the managing member of Operating Company may come into conflict with the duties that our directors and officers have to the Company and its stockholders.\nWe and TFP are currently the sole members of Operating Company, and we are the managing member of Operating Company. Our directors and officers have duties to us and our stockholders under applicable Maryland law in connection with our management. At the same time, we, as managing member of Operating Company, have fiduciary duties and obligations to Operating Company and its members (including TFP) under Delaware law and the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Operating Company. Our duties as managing member of Operating Company may come into conflict with the duties that our directors and officers have to us and our stockholders. These conflicts may be resolved in a manner that is not in the best interests of the Company or its stockholders.\nWe incur costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to these compliance activities.\nAs a public company, we incur legal, accounting and other costs that we did not incur prior to the Contribution Transactions. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act,\u201d the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules of the SEC, and NASDAQ, impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance activities. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nFurthermore, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to potential delisting by NASDAQ and review by such exchange, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which would require the expenditure by us of additional financial and management resources. As a result, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the market price of our common stock.\nSome provisions of our charter may delay, deter or prevent takeovers and business combinations that stockholders consider in their best interests.\nOur charter restricts any person that owns 9.8% or more of our capital stock, other than TFP and its affiliates or another stockholder approved by applicable state insurance regulators, from voting in excess of 9.8% of our voting securities. This provision is intended to satisfy the requirements of applicable state regulators in connection with insurance laws and regulations that prohibit any person from acquiring control of a regulated insurance company without the prior approval of the insurance\nregulators. In addition, our charter provides for the classification of our board of directors into three classes, one of which is to be elected each year. Our charter also generally only permits stockholders to act without a meeting by unanimous consent. These provisions may delay, deter or prevent takeovers and business combinations that stockholders consider in their best interests.\nMaryland takeover statutes may prevent a change of our control, which could depress our stock price.\nMaryland law provides that \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of a corporation acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d will have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter under the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act. \u201cControl shares\u201d means voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power: one-tenth or more but less than one-third; one-third or more but less than a majority; or a majority or more of all voting power. A \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d means the acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares, subject to certain exceptions.\nUnder Maryland law, \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which such stockholder became an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities.\nOur bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share statute any and all acquisitions by any person of our shares of stock. Our board of directors has also adopted a resolution which provides that any business combination between us and any other person is exempted from the provisions of the business combination statute, provided that the business combination is first approved by the board of directors. However, our board of directors may amend or eliminate this provision in our bylaws regarding the control share statute or amend or repeal this resolution regarding the business combination statute. If our board takes such action in the future, the control share and business combination statutes may prevent or discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer, including potential acquisitions that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nOur holding company structure with multiple lines of business, may adversely impact the market price of our Class A common stock and our ability to raise equity and debt capital.\nTiptree holds and manages multiple lines of business. Analysts, investors and lenders may have difficulty analyzing and valuing a company with multiple lines of business, which could adversely impact the market price of our Class A common stock and our ability to raise equity and debt capital at a holding company level. Moreover, our management is required to make decisions regarding the allocation of capital among the different lines of business, and such decisions could materially and adversely affect our business or one or more of our lines of business.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters\nMaintenance of our 1940 Act exemption will impose limits on our operations.\nWe intend to continue to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Therefore, we must limit the types and nature of businesses in which we may engage and assets that we may acquire. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire \u201cinvestment securities\u201d having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer\u2019s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Assets that would generally be excluded from the term \u201cinvestment securities,\u201d include securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on certain exceptions from the definition of investment company set forth in the 1940 Act. Assets that generally would constitute \u201cinvestment securities\u201d include loans, debt securities, preference shares and subordinated notes issued by CLOs.\nWe monitor our compliance with the 1940 Act on an ongoing basis and may be compelled to take or refrain from taking actions, to acquire additional income or loss generating assets or to forgo opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial or advisable, including, but not limited to selling assets that are considered to be investment securities or forgoing the sale of assets that are not investment securities, in order to ensure that we (or a subsidiary) may continue to rely on the applicable exceptions or exemptions. These limitations on our freedom of action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an exemption, exception or other exclusion from registration as an investment company, we could, among other things, be required to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations either to avoid being required to register as an investment company or to register as an investment company. If we were required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to, among other things, our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as\ndefined in the 1940 Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If we did not register despite being required to do so, criminal and civil actions could be brought against us, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court were to require enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business.\nA change in law, regulation or regulatory enforcement applicable to insurance products could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA change in state or U.S. federal tax laws could materially affect our insurance businesses. Currently, Fortegra does not collect sales or other related taxes on its services. Whether sales of Fortegra\u2019s services are subject to state sales and use taxes is uncertain, due in part to the nature of its services and the relationships through which its services are offered, as well as changing state laws and interpretations of those laws. One or more states may seek to impose sales or use tax or other tax collection obligations on Fortegra, whether based on sales by Fortegra or its resellers or clients, including for past sales. A successful assertion that Fortegra should be collecting sales or other related taxes on its services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing its services, discourage clients from offering or billing for its services, or otherwise cause material harm to its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWith regard to Fortegra\u2019s payment protection products, there are federal and state laws and regulations that govern the disclosures related to lenders\u2019 sales of those products. Fortegra\u2019s ability to offer and administer these products on behalf of financial institutions is dependent upon their continued ability to sell such products. To the extent that federal or state laws or regulations change to restrict or prohibit the sale of these products, Fortegra\u2019s revenues would be adversely affected. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB to add new regulatory oversight for the sales practices of such payment protection products. The CFPB\u2019s enforcement actions have resulted in large refunds and civil penalties against financial institutions in connection with their marketing of payment protection and other products. Due to such regulatory actions, some lenders may reduce their sales and marketing of payment protection and other ancillary products, which may adversely affect Fortegra\u2019s revenues. The full impact of the CFPB\u2019s oversight is unpredictable and continues to evolve. With respect to the property and casualty insurance policies Fortegra underwrites, federal legislative proposals regarding national catastrophe insurance, if adopted, could reduce the business need for some of the related products that Fortegra provides. Additionally, as the U.S. Congress continues to respond to the housing foreclosure crisis, it could enact legislation placing additional barriers on creditor-placed insurance.\nPFG generates revenue from the sale and administration of variable annuity and variable life insurance products which enjoy favorable U.S. federal income tax benefits that are conferred by statute or regulation. Should such benefits be curtailed or eliminated by changes in statute or regulation, PFG\u2019s continuing issuance of variable annuity and variable life insurance products could be adversely affected. Any retroactive application of changes could result in surrenders by holders of PFG\u2019s existing variable annuity and variable life insurance products and reduce PFG\u2019s revenues which, prior to its sale, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with existing and new regulations affecting our business in regulated industries may increase costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations administered and enforced by a number of different federal and state governmental authorities in the industries in which we operate. Regulation of such industries are expected to increase. In the past several years, there has been significant legislation affecting financial services, insurance and health care, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and many of the regulations associated with these laws have yet to be written. Accordingly, we cannot predict the impact that any new laws and regulations will have on us. The costs to comply with these laws and regulations may be substantial and could have a significant negative impact on us and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. We can give no assurances that with changes to laws and regulations, our businesses can continue to be conducted in each jurisdiction in the manner as we have in the past.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state and, in some cases, foreign insurance authorities with respect to statutory capital, reserve and other requirements. The laws of the various states in which our insurance businesses operate establish insurance departments and other regulatory agencies with broad powers to preclude or temporarily suspend our insurance subsidiaries from carrying on some or all of their activities or otherwise fine or penalize them in any jurisdiction in which they operate. Such regulation or compliance could reduce our insurance businesses\u2019 profitability or limit their growth by increasing the costs of compliance, limiting or restricting the products or services they sell, or the methods by which they sell their services and products, or subjecting their business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings.\nTAMCO is an asset management holding company registered with the SEC as an investment advisor and is subject to various federal and state laws and regulations and rules of various securities regulators and exchanges. These laws and regulations primarily are intended to protect clients and generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the carrying on of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in business for specific periods, the revocation of the registration as an investment adviser, censures and fines.\nThe properties held by our Care subsidiary are regulated by state and federal laws regarding healthcare facilities. Luxury is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the CFPB, the Federal Trade Commission and various state agencies that license, audit and conduct examinations.\nOur businesses are subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.\nOver the last several years, businesses in many areas of the financial services industry have been subject to increasing amounts of regulatory scrutiny. In addition, there has been an increase in litigation involving firms in the financial services industry and public companies generally, some of which have involved new types of legal claims, particularly in the insurance industry. We may be materially and adversely affected by judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, unanticipated costs or other effects of legal and administrative proceedings now pending or that may be instituted in the future, including from investigations by regulatory bodies or administrative agencies. An adverse outcome of any investigation by, or other inquiries from, any such bodies or agencies also could result in non-monetary penalties or sanctions, loss of licenses or approvals, changes in personnel, increased review and scrutiny of us by our clients, counterparties, regulatory authorities, potential litigants, the media and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFailure to protect our clients\u2019 confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of our reputation and customers, reduction in our profitability and subject us to fines, penalties and litigation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and our subsidiaries retain confidential information in our information systems, and we are subject to a variety of privacy regulations and confidentiality obligations. For example, some of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to the privacy regulations of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. We and certain of our subsidiaries also have contractual obligations to protect confidential information we obtain from third parties. These obligations generally require us, in accordance with applicable laws, to protect such information to the same extent that we protect our own confidential information. We have implemented physical, administrative and logical security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and systems and protecting our clients\u2019 and their customers\u2019 confidential information and personally-identifiable information against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through misdirection, theft or loss of data. Despite such efforts, we may be subject to a breach of our security systems that results in unauthorized access to our facilities and/or the information we are trying to protect. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our information systems could access, view, misappropriate, alter or delete any information in the systems, including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information. In addition, most states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of personally-identifiable customer information. Any compromise of the security of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 information systems that results in inappropriate disclosure of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity and damage to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 reputation, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, loss of clients, significant civil and criminal liability, litigation and the incurrence of significant technical, legal and other expenses, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 92111, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "TIPT"}
