RISK FACTORS\nMany statements contained in this annual report are forward-looking in nature. These statements are based on our current plans, intentions or expectation and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans, intentions or expectations. See \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking-Statements.\" Forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those specifically identified below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nDecreased spending by advertisers, decline in attendance of our live events and changes in the economy may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause a substantial majority of our net revenue is generated from the sale of local, regional and national advertising for broadcast or display on our radio stations, websites, online radio streams and at our live events, a downturn in the U.S. economy may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as advertisers generally reduce their spending during economic downturns. Furthermore, because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from local advertisers, our ability to generate advertising revenue in specific markets could be adversely affected by local or regional economic downturns. A downturn in the U.S. economy could also adversely affect our ability to collect accounts receivable from advertisers.\nIn addition, a significant percentage of our advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising to the automotive, financial services and retail industries. These industries, among others, have been adversely affected by prior downturns in the economy, and may be adversely affected by any future downturns in the economy, and a significant decrease in revenue in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of music concerts, multi-day music festivals, consumer expositions and trade shows, lifestyle events and other forms of entertainment may have an adverse effect on revenue and operating income from our live events business. In addition, during periods of economic slowdown and recession, many consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers have reduced their advertising expenditures. Consumer discretionary spending is sensitive to many factors such as employment, fuel and energy prices, and general economic conditions. The impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict, but they may result in reductions in ticket sales, sponsorships and our ability to generate revenue. The risks associated with our live events business may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession, which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at our live events. Many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live events are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that consumer spending will not be adversely impacted by economic conditions, or by any future deterioration in economic conditions, thereby possibly impacting the operating results and growth of our live events business.\nWe may lose audience ratings, market share and advertising revenue to competing radio stations or other types of media competitors.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. Our business competes for audiences and advertising market share with other radio stations and radio station groups, radio networks, other syndicated content and other media such as broadcast television, newspapers, magazines, cable television, satellite television, satellite radio, internet radio, the internet, outdoor advertising and hand-held programmable devices such as iPods and cellular phones. Any adverse change in a particular market or in the relative market positions of the radio stations located in a particular market, or any adverse change in audiences\u2019 preferences could have a material adverse effect on our ratings or revenue. Other radio broadcasting companies may enter the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future or offer syndicated content that competes with our content and these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we do. In addition, from time to time, other radio stations may change their format or content, or a radio station may adopt a format to compete directly with us for audiences and advertisers. These tactics could result in lower ratings, lower\nmarket share and lower advertising revenue or increased promotion and other expenses and, consequently, lower earnings and cash flow for us.\nWe face substantial competition for advertising revenue in our various markets from free and paid newspapers, magazines, websites, digital platforms and applications, television, radio, other forms of media, direct marketing and online advertising networks and exchanges. Competition for advertising is generally based on audience levels and demographics, price, service and advertising results. It has intensified both as a result of the continued development and fragmentation of digital media and adverse economic conditions. Competition from all of these media and services affects our ability to attract and retain advertisers and consumers and to maintain or increase our advertising rates.\nAudience preferences as to format or content may also shift due to demographic changes, personnel or other content changes, a decline in broadcast listening trends or other reasons. We may not be able to adapt to these changes or trends, any of which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition in the live events industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe live events industry is highly competitive, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition. The live events industry competes with other forms of music and non-music entertainment for consumers\u2019 discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book talent, and, in the markets in which we promote music concerts and festivals, we face competition from other promoters and venue operators. Our competitors compete with us for key employees who have existing talent relationships and that have a history of being able to book talent for concerts and tours. Our competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential talent and venues. Our competitors may develop services, advertising options or venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve. In addition, although many live events formats are annual in nature, there is risk that they will reach the end of their product cycle lives as consumer tastes evolve and we are unable to develop new events that cater to new consumer preferences. It is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.\nPoor weather adversely affects attendance at our live events, which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period.\nWe promote and/or ticket many live events. Weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets, concessions and merchandise, among other things. Poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote and/or ticket a finite number of events. Due to weather conditions, we may be required to reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue, which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event, as well as food, beverage and merchandise sales. Poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods, any of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live events, which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses, as well as reduce attendance at our live events, causing a decrease in our revenue.\nThere are inherent risks involved with producing live events. As a result, personal injuries and accidents have, and may, occur from time to time, which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries. Incidents in connection with our live events at any of our venues or festival sites that we own or rent could also result in claims, reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events, which could cause a decrease in our revenue. While we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient, in management\u2019s judgment, to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or events or accidents\nin the ordinary course of business, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if our broadcast rights contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms.\nWe sometimes enter into broadcast rights contracts in the ordinary course of business for both the acquisition and distribution of media content and products, including contracts for both the acquisition and distribution of content rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts relating to content produced by third parties on our radio stations. As these contracts expire, the parties must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose these rights, the related content and the related revenue. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining content rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than in the past) or the revenue from distribution of content may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than in the past). With respect to the acquisition of content rights, the impact of these broadcast rights contracts on our results over the terms of the contracts will depend on a number of factors beyond our control, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts, the size of audiences, and the related contract expenses and costs. There can be no assurance that revenue from content based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the content.\nIf we lose key members of our senior management team, our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer. Our business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our senior management team.\nWe believe that the skills and experience of our senior management team would be difficult to replace, and the loss of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including impairing our ability to execute our business strategy. We believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel.\nWe may lose key on-air talent to competing radio stations or other types of media competitors.\nWe compete for creative and performing on-air talent with other radio stations and radio station groups, radio networks, and other providers of syndicated content and other media such as broadcast television, cable television, satellite television, the internet and satellite radio. Our employees and other on-air talent are subject to change and may be lost to competitors or for other reasons. Any adverse changes in particular programs, formats or on-air talent could have a material adverse effect on our ratings and our ability to attract advertisers, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results are dependent on radio advertising revenue, which can vary from even to odd-numbered years based on the volatility and unpredictability of political revenue\nApproximately 2.1%, 0.6% and 2.9% of our net revenue, pro forma for the Transactions, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, consisted of political advertising revenue. Political advertising revenue from elections, which is generally greater in even-numbered years, has the potential to create fluctuations in our operating results on a year-to-year basis. For example, during 2014, we had political advertising revenue of $8.1 million, compared to $2.2 million in 2013, pro forma for the Transactions. In addition, political advertising revenue is dependent on the level of political ad spend and competitiveness of elections within each local market.\nThe rates we charge for in-stream and mobile advertisements are currently less than those we charge for terrestrial radio advertisements.\nThe rates we charge for in-stream and mobile advertisements are currently less than those we charge for terrestrial radio advertisements. Listeners are increasingly shifting toward online radio streams and mobile applications.\nIf we are unable to sufficiently increase the rates we charge for in-stream and mobile advertisements, a significant shift in listeners could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo remain competitive, we must respond to changes in technology, services and standards that characterize our industry.\nThe radio broadcasting industry is subject to technological change, evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and trends. We may not have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies and may allow us to adapt to new trends.\nVarious new media technologies and services are being developed or introduced, including:\n\u2022\nsatellite-delivered digital audio radio service, which has resulted in the introduction of new subscriber-based satellite radio services with numerous niche formats;\n\u2022\naudio content by cable systems, direct-broadcast satellite systems, personal communications systems, content available over the internet and other digital audio broadcast formats;\n\u2022\nin-band on-channel digital radio, which provides multi-channel, multi-format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional AM and FM radio services;\n\u2022\nthe FCC has authorized many new Low-Power FM radio stations, and is likely to authorize many more, which will result in additional FM radio broadcast outlets, although such radio stations are required to operate on a non-commercial basis;\n\u2022\niPhone/iPod/iPad and similar mobile devices; and\n\u2022\nstreaming internet services such as Pandora.\nThe radio broadcasting industry historically has grown despite the introduction of new technologies for the delivery of entertainment and information, including the introduction of new technologies used in automobiles, as a result, in part, of a growing population, greater use of the automobile and increased commuter times. We cannot guarantee that this historical growth will continue. Some of the new technologies, particularly satellite digital audio radio service and internet radio, compete for the consumer\u2019s attention in the car, workplace, outdoors and elsewhere. In addition, we cannot predict the effect, if any, that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory changes may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on our business, financial condition and results of operations, some of which could result in the imposition of significant costs and expenses not previously part of our business operations.\nThe failure or destruction of transmitter and other facilities that we depend upon to distribute our content could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use studios, satellite systems, transmitter facilities and the internet to originate and/or distribute our content. We rely on third-party contracts and services to operate our origination and distribution facilities. These third-party contracts and services include, but are not limited to, electrical power, satellite downlinks, telecom circuits and internet connectivity. Distribution may be disrupted due to one or more third parties losing their ability to provide particular services to us, which could adversely affect our distribution capabilities. A disruption can be caused as a result of any number of events such as local disasters (accidental or environmental), various acts of terrorism, power outages, major telecom and internet connectivity failures or satellite failures. Our ability to distribute content to radio station audience and/or network affiliates may be disrupted for an undetermined period of time until alternate facilities are engaged and put on-line. Furthermore, until we fix issues that arise or third-party services resume when applicable, the inability to originate or distribute content could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to retain and grow our digital audience, our business will be adversely affected.\nThe increasing number of digital media options available on the internet, through social networking tools and through mobile and other devices distributing news and other content is expanding consumer choice significantly. Faced with a multitude of media choices and a dramatic increase in accessible information, consumers may place greater value on when, where, how and at what price they consume digital content than they do on the source or reliability of such content. The increasing popularity of news aggregation websites and customized news feeds (often free to users) may reduce our traffic levels by creating a disincentive for the audience to visit our websites or use our digital applications. In addition, the undifferentiated presentation of some of our content in aggregation with other content may lead audiences to fail to distinguish our content from the content of other providers. Our reputations for quality journalism and content are important in competing for revenue in this environment and are based on consumer and advertiser perceptions. If consumers fail to differentiate our content from other content providers in digital media, or if the quality of our journalism or content is perceived as less reliable, we may not be able to increase our online traffic sufficiently or retain a base of frequent visitors to our digital properties.\nOnline traffic is also driven by internet search results, including search results provided by Google, the primary search engine directing traffic to our websites. Search engines frequently update and change the methods for directing search queries to websites or change methodologies or metrics for valuing the quality and performance of internet traffic on delivering cost-per-click advertisements. Any such changes could decrease the amount of revenue that we generate from online advertisements. The failure to successfully manage search engine optimization efforts across our business could result in a significant decrease in traffic to our various websites, which could result in substantial decreases in conversion rates and repeat business, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, any or all of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf traffic levels stagnate or decline, we may not be able to create sufficient advertiser interest in our digital properties or to maintain or increase the advertising rates of the inventory on our digital properties. Even if we maintain traffic levels, the market position of our brands may not be enough to counteract a significant downward pressure on advertising rates as a result of a significant increase in inventory.\nIf we fail to increase the number of subscribers or retain existing subscriber services at Townsquare Interactive, our revenue and business will be harmed.\nThe ability to grow Townsquare Interactive depends in large part on maintaining and expanding our subscriber base. To do so, we must convince prospective subscribers of the benefits of our technology platform and existing subscribers of the continuing value of our products and services. The digital marketing services sector is a highly competitive area with many competitors in which our customers have many competing alternatives. We believe our solutions are well positioned to serve the SMBs in the small and mid-sized markets we focus upon. However, if our subscribers stop their subscriptions with us, or if we are unable to attract new subscribers in numbers greater than the number of subscribers that we lose, our subscriber base will decrease and our business, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur digital advertising network competes in a rapidly growing and evolving market. If our advertising solutions are not compelling or we falter on execution, we may be unable to attract new affiliates or existing clients may turn to alternative solutions.\nThe national digital advertising market represents a significant growth opportunity. Our success is dependent on many factors outside of our control including the quality of content on our affiliates\u2019 websites, the number of visitors they attract and their level of user engagement. The execution of our own business strategy including the effectiveness of the advertising solutions we provide and the abilities of our national digital sales force will impact our level of success. We also face a variety of competitors who have greater scale, market share and platforms that could hinder our ability to compete effectively. The success of our strategy will depend on our ability to convince new advertisers of the benefits of our advertising platform and existing clients of the continuing value of our solutions. Failure to deliver on those objectives could significantly affect our business operations and our ability to compete effectively.\nOur national digital businesses are dependent on technology and technical and sales talent.\nFuture success and growth in our national digital businesses will depend upon our continued ability to develop and maintain technology and identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled technical and sales talent. Competition for employees with these skill sets is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees. We will also need to be able to balance the costs of recruiting and retaining these employees with profitable growth. If we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFuture losses could be caused by future asset impairment of our FCC licenses and/or goodwill.\nUnder Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cFASB ASC\u201d) Topic 350, \u201cIntangibles-Goodwill and Other,\u201d goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, including FCC licenses, are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset over its fair value. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are also measured for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. Impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our FCC licenses and goodwill comprised approximately 75% of our consolidated total assets. The valuation of intangible assets is subjective and based on estimates rather than precise calculations. If actual future results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future. The fair value measurements for both our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs which reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk.\nGiven the current economic environment and the potential negative impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn, or the period and strength of recovery, made for the purpose of our non-amortizable intangible fair value estimates will prove to be accurate.\nInterim and/or annual impairment testing, as applicable, could result in future impairment losses. The fair value of FCC licenses and goodwill is primarily dependent on the expected future cash flows of our business. If actual market conditions and operational performance underlying the intangible assets were to deteriorate, or if facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses or goodwill below their adjusted carrying amounts, the Company may be required to recognize additional non-cash impairment charges in future periods, which could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends upon licenses issued by the FCC, and if licenses were not renewed or we were to be out of compliance with FCC regulations and policies, our business could be materially impaired.\nOur radio stations depend upon maintaining their broadcasting licenses issued by the FCC, which are currently issued for a maximum term of eight years and are renewable. Interested parties may challenge a renewal application. On rare occasions, the FCC has revoked licenses, not renewed them, or renewed them with significant qualifications, including renewals for less than a full term of eight years. In the last renewal cycle, the FCC granted nearly all of the license renewal applications that were filed for our radio stations. However, we cannot be certain that our future license renewal applications will be approved, or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, could result in material impairment and could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. If any of our FCC licenses are not renewed, it could prevent us from operating the affected radio station and generating revenue from it. Further, the FCC has a general policy restricting the transferability of a radio station license while a renewal application for that radio station is pending. In addition, we must comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies governing the ownership and operation of our radio stations. FCC regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market, which could\nrestrict our ability to consummate future transactions. The FCC\u2019s rules governing our radio station operations impose costs on our operations and changes in those rules could have an adverse effect on our business. The FCC also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations. If the FCC relaxes these technical requirements, it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, governmental regulations and policies may change over time, and the changes may have a material adverse impact upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further details on federal regulation of radio broadcasting, see \u201cBusiness-Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting.\u201d\nWe may be adversely affected by the FCC\u2019s enforcement of its indecency regulations against the broadcast industry as well as by the increased amounts of the potential fines.\nThe FCC\u2019s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent material between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent material because of the vagueness of the FCC\u2019s definition of indecent material, coupled with the spontaneity of live content. The FCC vigorously enforces its indecency rules against the broadcasting industry as a whole and violations of these rules may result in fines or, in some instances, revocation of an FCC license. The FCC also can impose separate fines for each allegedly indecent \u201cutterance\u201d within radio content. In addition, in 2006 Congress increased the maximum forfeiture for a single indecency violation to $325,000, with a maximum forfeiture exposure of $3,000,000 for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. Several appeals of certain of the FCC\u2019s recent enforcement actions and of the FCC\u2019s underlying indecency standards are pending in the federal courts. We cannot predict the outcome of these court proceedings or whether Congress will consider or adopt further legislation in this area. In the ordinary course of business, we have received complaints or the FCC has received complaints about whether a limited number of our radio stations have broadcast indecent content. To the extent these complaints or other proceedings by the FCC result in the imposition of fines, a settlement with the FCC, revocation of any of our radio station licenses or denials of license renewal applications, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by the FCC\u2019s proceedings with respect to Revitalization of AM Radio.\nIn October 2013, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking titled \u201cRevitalization of AM Radio,\u201d proposing several modifications to its technical rules for AM radio stations. The stated purpose of this FCC rulemaking proceeding is to enhance the broadcast quality of AM stations. Included in the possible rule changes is the elimination of a rule which requires certain AM stations to reduce nighttime interference when seeking to modify their facilities. Also proposed is a relaxation of the FCC\u2019s requirements for AM stations to provide their communities of license with a specific level of signal coverage, with the intended purpose of permitting AM stations to change the locations of their transmitting facilities. If the FCC adopts these rule changes, it is possible that some of our stations may experience increased nighttime interference from other stations in connection with facility modifications. It is also possible that stations owned by others and not serving our markets could move into our markets and become new competitors. We cannot predict at this time to what extent, if any, the FCC\u2019s proposals will be adopted or the impact the adoption of any one or more of the proposals will have on our Company.\nProposed legislation requires radio broadcasters to pay royalties to record labels and recording artists.\nLegislation has been introduced that would require radio broadcasters to pay royalties to record labels and performing artists for exhibition or use of the over the air broadcast of their recorded songs. Currently, we pay royalties to song composers and publishers through Broadcast Music, Inc., the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and SESAC, Inc. The proposed legislation would add an additional layer of royalties to be paid directly to the record labels and artists. It is currently unknown what proposed legislation, if any, will become law, and what significance this royalty would have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to obtain prior federal approval for each station acquisition, which approvals may be subject to our compliance with certain conditions, possibly including asset divestitures, which may be material.\nAcquisitions have been and may continue to be, a critical component of our overall strategy. The acquisition of a radio station requires the prior approval of the FCC and may require approvals by other governmental agencies, such as the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) or the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d). To obtain that approval, a proposed acquirer is required to file a transfer of control or assignment of license application with the FCC. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cCommunications Act\u201d) and FCC rules allow members of the public and other interested parties to file petitions to deny or other objections to the FCC with respect to the grant of any transfer or assignment application. The FCC could rely on those objections or its own initiative to deny a transfer or assignment application or to require changes in the transaction, including the divestiture of radio stations and other assets, as a condition to having the application granted. Although we do not currently expect such divestitures to be material to our financial position or results of operations, no assurances can be provided that we would not be required to divest additional radio stations in connection with obtaining such approval, or that any such required divestitures would not be material to our financial position or results of operations. The FCC could also change its existing rules and policies to reduce the number of radio stations that we would be permitted to acquire in some markets. For these and other reasons, there can be no assurance that the FCC will approve potential future acquisitions that we deem material to our business.\nThere are risks associated with our radio station acquisition strategy.\nWe intend to continue to grow by acquiring radio station clusters and individual radio stations in the future. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing these acquisitions or what the consequences of these acquisitions will be. Any acquisitions in the future may be subject to various conditions, such as compliance with FCC and antitrust regulatory requirements. The FCC requirements include:\n\u2022\napproval of license assignments and transfers;\n\u2022\nlimits on the number of radio stations a broadcaster may own in a given local market; and\n\u2022\nother rules and policies, such as the ownership attribution rules, that could limit our ability to acquire radio stations in certain markets where one or more of our stockholders, officers or directors have other media interests.\nThe antitrust regulatory requirements include:\n\u2022\nfilings with the DOJ and the FTC under the HSR Act, where applicable;\n\u2022\nexpiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act; and\n\u2022\npossible review by the DOJ or the FTC of antitrust issues under the HSR Act or otherwise.\nCompletion of any acquisition may also only be approved subject to our compliance with certain conditions. These conditions may be onerous, and may include the requirement that we divest certain assets, which may include radio stations we already own or we propose to acquire. We cannot be certain whether any of these conditions will be satisfied, the timing thereof, or the potential impact on us any such conditions may have. In addition, the FCC has in the past asserted the authority to review levels of local radio market concentration as part of its acquisition approval process, even where proposed assignments would comply with the numerical limits on local radio station ownership in the FCC\u2019s rules and the Communications Act.\nOur acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, including risks associated with:\n\u2022\nidentifying acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;\n\u2022\nintegrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of radio stations;\n\u2022\ndiverting our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\npotentially losing key employees at acquired radio stations; and\n\u2022\na diminishing number of properties available for sale in appropriately sized and located markets.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions or manage the resulting business effectively, or that any acquisition will achieve the benefits that we anticipate. In addition, we are not certain that we will be able to acquire properties at valuations as favorable as those of previous acquisitions. Depending upon the nature, size and timing of potential future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing in order to consummate additional acquisitions. Our debt agreements, as may be in place at any time, may not permit us to consummate an acquisition or access the necessary additional financing because of certain covenant restrictions. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us or, if available, that financing would be on terms acceptable to our management.\nDue to various market and financial conditions, we may not be able to successfully complete future dispositions of our radio stations or future acquisitions of other radio stations.\nWe engage in strategic sales of our radio stations, as it makes financial sense to do so and meets our overall business needs, and have also been required by the FCC to divest radio stations, which radio stations are now held in trust pending sale. We pursue strategic acquisitions of stations when such acquisitions are strategic and financially additive and such acquisitions meet our overall business needs. However, in light of the current financial and economic market conditions, both in the radio industry and in the overall U.S. economy, our consummation of future radio station acquisitions or dispositions, even those required divestitures, is uncertain and may be very difficult.\nOur success is dependent upon audience acceptance of our content, particularly our radio programs and live events, which is difficult to predict.\nMedia and radio content production and distribution is an inherently risky business because the revenue derived from the production and distribution of media content or a radio program, and the licensing of rights to the intellectual property associated with the content or program, depend primarily upon their acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of content or a program also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict.\nRatings for broadcast radio stations and traffic or visitors on a particular website are also factors that are weighed when advertisers determine which outlets to use and in determining the advertising rates that the outlet receives. Poor ratings or traffic levels can lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising revenue. For example, if there is an event causing a change of programming at one of our radio stations, there could be no assurance that any replacement programming would generate the same level of ratings, revenue or profitability as the previous programming. In addition, changes in ratings methodology and technology could adversely impact our ratings and negatively affect our advertising revenue. Nielsen, the leading supplier of ratings data for U.S. radio markets, developed technology to passively collect data for its ratings service. The Portable People Meter\u2122 (\u201cPPM\u2122\u201d) is a small, pager-sized device that does not require any active manipulation by the end user and is capable of automatically measuring radio, television, internet, satellite radio and satellite television signals that are encoded for the service by the broadcaster. Some of our market ratings are being measured by PPM\u2122. In each market, there has been a compression in the relative ratings of all radio stations in the market, enhancing the competitive pressure within the market for advertising dollars. In addition, ratings for certain radio stations when measured by PPM\u2122 as opposed to the traditional diary methodology can be materially different. PPM\u2122 based ratings may be scheduled to be introduced in some of our other markets. Because of the competitive factors we face and the introduction of PPM\u2122, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain or increase our current audience ratings and advertising revenue, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. Our live events business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on the availability of popular artists. Our live events business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them. Since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform at live events, any lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue.\nIn addition, our live events business typically plans and makes certain commitments to future events up to 18 months in advance of the event, and often agrees to pay an artist or other service providers or venues a fixed guaranteed deposit amount prior to our receiving any revenue as is standard in the live events industry. Therefore, if the public is not receptive to the event, or we or an artist cancel the event, we may incur a loss for the event depending on the amount of the fixed guaranteed or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned, as well as revenue we could have earned at the event. For certain events, we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses but it may not be sufficient and is subject to deductibles. Furthermore, consumer preferences change from time to time, and our failure to anticipate, identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew or changing federal, state or international privacy legislation or regulation could hinder the growth of our internet properties.\nA variety of federal and state laws govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data that our internet properties use to operate certain services and to deliver certain advertisements to its customers, as well as the technologies used to collect such data. Not only are existing privacy-related laws in these jurisdictions evolving and subject to potentially disparate interpretation by governmental entities, new legislative proposals affecting privacy are now pending at both the federal and state level in the U.S. Changes to the interpretation of existing law or the adoption of new privacy-related requirements could hinder the growth of our internet presence. Also, a failure or perceived failure to comply with such laws or requirements or with our own policies and procedures could result in significant liabilities, including a possible loss of consumer or investor confidence or a loss of customers or advertisers, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew technologies could block our ads, which would harm our business.\nTechnologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads and that provide tools to users to opt out of our advertising products. Most of our revenue from our digital businesses are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages for our users. As a result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe rely on third parties to provide the technologies necessary to deliver content, advertising, and services to our audience, and any change in the licensing terms, costs, availability, or acceptance of these formats and technologies could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third parties to provide the technologies that we use to deliver content, advertising, and services to our audience. There can be no assurance that these providers will continue to license their technologies or intellectual property to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Providers may change the fees they charge users or otherwise change their business model in a manner that slows the widespread acceptance of their technologies. In order for our services to be successful, there must be a large base of users of the technologies necessary to deliver our content, advertising, and services. We have limited or no control over the availability or acceptance of those technologies, and any change in the licensing terms, costs, availability, or user acceptance of these technologies could adversely affect our business.\nCertain components of our online business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our audience. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of our audience and advertisers\nCertain of our products and services depend on the ability of our audience to access the internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone\ncompanies, cable companies, mobile communications companies and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our audience to provide our offerings. Such interference could result in a loss of existing audience and advertisers, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new audience and advertisers, thereby harming our revenue and growth.\nWe are controlled by a financial sponsor, whose interests may not be aligned with ours or yours.\nWe are controlled by funds managed by Oaktree, and therefore they have the power to control our affairs and policies, including entering into mergers, sales of substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary transactions as well as decisions to issue shares, declare dividends, and make other decisions, and they may have an interest in our doing so. The interests of Oaktree could conflict with your interests in material respects. Furthermore, Oaktree is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us, as well as businesses that represent major customers of our business. Oaktree may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as Oaktree continues to own a significant amount of our outstanding capital stock, they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.\nWe may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters.\nThe occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, intentional or unintentional mass casualty incidents or similar events may substantially impact our operations in specific geographic areas, as well as nationally, and it may decrease the use of and demand for advertising, which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, for example, caused a nationwide disruption of commercial activities. The occurrence of future terrorist attacks, military actions by the U.S., contagious disease outbreaks or other unforeseen similar events cannot be predicted, and their occurrence can be expected to further negatively affect the economies where we do business generally, specifically the market for advertising. In addition, an act of God or a natural disaster could adversely impact any one or more of the markets where we do business, thereby impacting the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCapital requirements necessary to operate our business or implement acquisitions could pose risks.\nOur business requires a certain level of capital expenditures. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, adversely impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations. We face competition from other media companies for acquisition opportunities. If the prices sought by sellers of these companies were to rise, we would find fewer acceptable acquisition opportunities. In addition, the purchase price of possible acquisition could require additional debt or equity financing on our part. Since the terms and availability of this financing depend to a large degree upon general economic conditions and third parties over which we have no control, we can give no assurance that we will obtain the needed financing or that we will obtain such financing on attractive terms. In addition, our ability to obtain financing depends on a number of other factors, many of which are also beyond our control, such as interest rates and national and local business conditions. If the cost of obtaining needed financing is too high or the terms of such financing are otherwise unacceptable in relation to the acquisition opportunity we are presented with, we may decide to forego that opportunity. Additional indebtedness could increase our leverage and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and may limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have an adverse impact on us.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, we had $532.5 million of outstanding indebtedness with annual debt service requirements of approximately $42.6 million. On an as reported basis, debt service for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $45.1 million, which represented 99.6% of cash flow from operating\nactivities. Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have other significant effects on our business.\nFor example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from taking advantage of opportunities to grow our business;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt obligations; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes on satisfactory terms or at all.\nWe believe that our cash balance, together with the undrawn portion of our revolver and cash generated by operating activities, will be sufficient to fund our operations, service our debt obligations and pursue our strategy in the future.\nIn addition, the agreements evidencing or governing our current indebtedness do contain, and the agreements evidencing or governing our future indebtedness may contain, restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"Section 404\"), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are not required to provide five years of selected financial data in this annual report. We have not made a decision whether to take advantage of any or all of these exemptions. We do not know if some investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. The result may be a less active trading market for our securities and our security prices may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting\nstandards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we chose to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.\nWe are classified as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and, as a result, we qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nCertain funds managed by Oaktree continue to control a majority of the voting power of our common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the applicable stock exchange corporate governance standards. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, a company of which more than 50% of the outstanding voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain stock exchange corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of the board of directors consists of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that nominating and corporate governance matters be decided solely by independent directors; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that employee and officer compensation matters be decided solely by independent directors.\nWe intend to utilize these exemptions. As a result, we may not have a majority of independent directors and our nominating and corporate governance and compensation functions may not be decided solely by independent directors. Accordingly, you would not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the stock exchange corporate governance requirements.\nThe public market for our Class A Common Stock may be volatile.\nWe cannot assure you that the market price of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including those described under \u201c-Risks Related to Our Business\u201d and the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our Class A common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\ndowngrades by any securities analysts who follow our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole and, in particular, in the retail sales environment;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 perceptions of our prospects;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures or capital commitments; and\n\u2022\nchanges in key personnel.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, including companies in the retail industry. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nOur majority stockholder has the ability to control significant corporate activities and our majority stockholder\u2019s interests may not coincide with yours.\nCertain funds managed by Oaktree beneficially own approximately 1.6 million shares of our Class A common stock, 2.2 million shares of our Class B common stock and approximately 8.6 million shares of our Class A common stock underlying warrants, which together represent approximately 58.2% of the voting power of our common stock. Pursuant to a Stockholders\u2019 Agreement entered into by and between Oaktree, FiveWire Media Ventures LLC (\"FiveWire\") (an entity formed for the purpose of investing in the Company by certain members of management, including Steven Price, Stuart Rosenstein, Alex Berkett, Dhruv Prasad and certain other individuals (together, the \"FiveWire Holders\")) and the FiveWire Holders (the \"Stockholders' Agreement\"), Oaktree controls approximately 80.3% of the voting power on matters presented to our stockholders. As a result of its ownership, Oaktree, so long as it holds a majority of the voting power on matters presented to our stockholders, will have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and, through our Board of Directors, the ability to control decision-making with respect to our business direction and policies. Pursuant to the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement, each FiveWire Holder grants to Oaktree an irrevocable proxy to vote their shares of Class B common stock, which shall remain in effect for so long as Oaktree beneficially owns at least 50% of the number of shares of common stock held immediately following the initial public offering. In addition, pursuant to the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement, until Oaktree ceases to beneficially own at least 33.3% of the number of shares of common stock held immediately following the initial public offering, Oaktree has the right to designate three directors to our board of directors, each of whom will have, until Oaktree ceases to beneficially own at least 70.0% of the number of shares of common stock held immediately following the initial public offering, two votes on each matter. Matters over which Oaktree will, directly or indirectly, exercise control include:\n\u2022\nthe election of our Board of Directors and the appointment and removal of our officers;\n\u2022\nmergers and other business combination transactions, including proposed transactions that would result in our stockholders receiving a premium price for their shares;\n\u2022\nother acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets;\n\u2022\nincurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of equity securities;\n\u2022\nrepurchase of stock and payment of dividends; and\n\u2022\nthe issuance of shares to management under our equity incentive plans.\nEven if the voting power of certain funds managed by Oaktree falls below a majority and those funds no longer have the right to designate directors to our board of directors pursuant to the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement, they may continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. Under our certificate of incorporation, Oaktree and its affiliates will not have any obligation to present to us, and Oaktree may separately pursue, corporate opportunities of which they become aware, even if those opportunities are ones that we would have pursued if granted the opportunity.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. As of December 31, 2014 we have 9,457,242 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, outstanding warrants to purchase 9,508,878 shares of Class A common stock, 3,022,484 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and 4,894,480 shares of Class C common stock outstanding. The shares of Class A common stock are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for any shares of our Class A common stock that may be held or acquired by our directors, executive officers and other affiliates, as that term is defined in the Securities Act, which are restricted securities under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may not be sold in the public market unless the sale is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available.\nWe, each of our officers and directors, Oaktree and certain other security holders have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, with the underwriters of our initial public offering not to dispose of or hedge any of the shares of Class A common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock during the period from the date of our initial public offering continuing through the date that is 180 days after the date of our initial public offering (subject to extension in certain circumstances), except, in our case, for the issuance of common stock upon exercise of options under our existing management incentive plan. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated may, in their sole discretion, release any of these shares from these restrictions at any time without notice.\nAll of our shares of Class A common stock outstanding as of the date of this annual report may be sold in the public market by existing stockholders 180 days after the date of our initial public offering (subject to extension in certain circumstances) and applicable volume and other limitations imposed under federal securities laws.\nSubject to any lock-up restrictions described above with respect to certain holders, holders of approximately 17.7 million shares of our Class A common stock (including shares underlying outstanding warrants and assuming the conversion of all shares of Class B and Class C common stock into shares of Class A common stock, each on a one-for-one basis) have the right to require us to register the sales of their shares under the Securities Act, under the terms of an agreement between us and the holders of these securities.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we are subject to additional financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy and may divert management\u2019s attention from our business.\nAs a public company, we are required to file annual and quarterly reports and other information pursuant to the Exchange Act with the SEC. We are required to ensure that we have the ability to prepare consolidated financial statements that comply with SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. We are subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including the applicable stock exchange listing standards and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant compliance obligations upon us. Specifically, we are required to:\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic reports and other stockholder communications in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws and applicable stock exchange rules;\n\u2022\ncreate or expand the roles and duties of our Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\ninstitute compliance and internal audit functions that are more comprehensive;\n\u2022\nevaluate and maintain our system of internal control over financial reporting, and report on management\u2019s assessment thereof, in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u2022\nenhance our investor relations function;\n\u2022\nmaintain internal policies, including those relating to disclosure controls and procedures; and\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain outside legal counsel and accountants in connection with the activities listed above.\nAs a public company, we are required to commit significant resources and management time and attention to the above-listed requirements, which will cause us to incur significant costs and which may place a strain on our systems and resources. As a result, our management\u2019s attention might be diverted from other business concerns. In addition, we might not be successful in implementing these requirements. Compliance with these requirements will place significant demands on our legal, accounting and finance staff and on our accounting, financial and information systems and will increase our legal and accounting compliance costs as well as our compensation expense as we may be required to hire additional accounting, tax, finance and legal staff with the requisite technical knowledge.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, significant resources and management oversight will be required. We will be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. We expect to incur certain additional annual expenses related to these activities and, among other things, additional directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, director fees, reporting requirements, transfer agent fees, hiring additional accounting, legal and administrative personnel, increased auditing and legal fees and similar expenses.\nFailure to comply with requirements to design, implement and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe are not required to comply with Section 404(b) for the annual reporting period ended December 31, 2014, and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls for that purpose. Being a public company, we have significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. If we are unable to establish or maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations on a timely basis, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and harm our operating results. In addition, we will be required, pursuant to Section 404(a), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year beginning after the effective date of our initial public offering. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Testing and maintaining internal controls may divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to our business. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 or our independent registered public accounting firm may not issue an unqualified opinion. If either we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our stock.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest formally to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the later of our second annual report or the first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls in the future.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our by-laws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nUnder our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, individuals or entities that bring certain claims or join such claims may be obligated to reimburse the Company for the expenses it reasonably incurs in connection with such actions if the claim proves unsuccessful.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in the event that any person or entity (the \u201cClaimant\u201d) (x) initiates or asserts (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (2) any claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company to the Company or its stockholders, (3) any action against the Company or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or our Amended and Restated Bylaws, or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine (each of the foregoing, a \u201cClaim\u201d), or joins any such Claim as a named party, and (y) does not thereby obtain a judgment on the merits that substantially achieves the full remedy or relief sought in the Claim, such Claimant shall be jointly and severally obligated to reimburse the Company for all fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees and the fees of experts) actually and reasonably incurred by the Company in defending such Claim. This provision of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may deter shareholder litigation that may be in the best interests of the Company or our stockholders.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our Class A common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nBecause we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than your purchase price.\nThe continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, including agreements governing our indebtedness, any potential indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Accordingly, if you purchase shares, realization of a gain on your investment will\ndepend on the appreciation of the price of our Class A common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The deterioration of income from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation could have the effect of preventing the Company from having the benefit of certain business opportunities that it may otherwise be entitled to pursue.\nOur certificate of incorporation will provide that certain funds managed by Oaktree and its affiliates are not required to offer corporate opportunities of which they become aware to us and could, therefore, offer such opportunities instead to other companies, including affiliates of Oaktree. In the event that Oaktree obtains business opportunities from which we might otherwise benefit but chooses not to present such opportunities to us, these provisions of our certificate of incorporation could have the effect of preventing us from pursuing transactions or relationships that would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws may delay, discourage or prevent a change in control.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws will contain provisions that may delay, discourage or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. As a result, shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.", "PERMNO": 87564, "SIC": 4832, "TIC": "TSQ"}
