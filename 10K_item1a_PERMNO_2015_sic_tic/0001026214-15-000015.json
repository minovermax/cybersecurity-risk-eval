RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves risks, including the risks described below and in \u201cBUSINESS,\u201d \u201cMD&A,\u201d and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. These risks and uncertainties could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and/or prospects.\nConservatorship and Related Matters\nThe future status and role of Freddie Mac are uncertain.\nOur future is uncertain. It is likely that future legislative or regulatory action will materially affect our role, business model, structure, and results of operations. Some or all of our functions could be transferred to other institutions, and we could cease to exist as a stockholder-owned company or at all. If any of these events were to occur, our shares could further diminish\nFreddie Mac\nin value, or cease to have any value, and there can be no assurance that our stockholders would receive any compensation for such loss in value.\nSeveral bills were introduced in Congress in 2013 and 2014 concerning the future status of Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and the mortgage finance system, including bills which provided for the wind down of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The Administration has recommended reducing the role of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and ultimately winding down both companies.\nThe conservatorship is indefinite in duration. The timing and likelihood of our emerging from conservatorship are uncertain, as are the circumstances under which that might occur. Termination of the conservatorship (other than in connection with receivership) also requires Treasury\u2019s consent under the Purchase Agreement. There can be no assurance about whether, and under what circumstances, Treasury would give such consent. It is possible that the conservatorship will end with us being placed into receivership. Even if the conservatorship is terminated, we would remain subject to the Purchase Agreement and the senior preferred stock. In addition, because Treasury holds a warrant to acquire almost 80% of our common stock for nominal consideration, the company could effectively remain under the control of the U.S. government even if the conservatorship is ended and the voting rights of common stockholders are restored.\nDuring 2013 and 2014, a number of lawsuits were filed against the U.S. government challenging certain government actions related to the conservatorship (including actions taken in connection with the imposition of conservatorship) and the Purchase Agreement. This may add to the uncertainty surrounding our future.\nFor more information, see \u201cBUSINESS - Regulation and Supervision - Legislative and Regulatory Developments,\u201d \u201cITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,\u201d and \u201cNOTE 17: LEGAL CONTINGENCIES.\u201d\nWe may request additional draws under the Purchase Agreement in future periods.\nWe may request additional draws under the Purchase Agreement in future periods. The need for any such future draws will be determined by a variety of factors that could adversely affect our net worth or our ability to generate comprehensive income, including the following:\n\u2022\ndeclines in home prices;\n\u2022\nthe success of our foreclosure prevention and loss mitigation efforts;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in interest rates, yield curves, implied volatility or mortgage spreads, which could affect derivatives and mortgage-related securities held by us and increase realized and unrealized losses recorded in earnings or AOCI;\n\u2022\nthe required reductions in the size of our mortgage-related investments portfolio or reductions of higher yielding assets, and other limitations on our investment activities that reduce our earnings capacity;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our single-family guarantee activities that could reduce our income from these activities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the volume of multifamily business we may conduct or other limits on multifamily business activities that could reduce our income from these activities;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in our liquidity or funding costs, or limitations in our access to public debt markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting practices or guidance;\n\u2022\neffects of the MHA Program and other government initiatives, including any future requirements to forgive the principal amount of loans, which could increase the likelihood of prepayment of mortgages and potentially reduce our net interest income;\n\u2022\nchanges in housing or economic conditions, legislation, or other factors that affect our assessment of our ability to realize our net deferred tax asset, and cause us to establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset;\n\u2022\nchanges in business practices resulting from legislative and regulatory developments or direction from our Conservator; or\n\u2022\nreductions in corporate tax rates resulting in an inability to realize our net deferred tax asset at its current book value.\nWe cannot retain capital from the earnings generated by our business operations, as a result of the net worth sweep dividend. This increases the likelihood of draws in future periods, particularly as the permitted Capital Reserve Amount (which is $1.8 billion for 2015) declines over time. Any future draws we take will reduce the amount of available funding remaining under the Purchase Agreement, which was $140.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. Additional draws and corresponding increases in the already substantial liquidation preference of our senior preferred stock ($72.3 billion as of December 31, 2014), along with the limited flexibility we have to redeem it, may add to the uncertainty regarding our long-term financial sustainability.\nWe are under the control of FHFA, and our business activities are subject to significant restrictions. We may be required to take actions that materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may be required to undertake activities that are unprofitable, difficult to implement, expose us to additional credit and other risks, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results over the short- or long-term. We are under the\nFreddie Mac\ncontrol of FHFA, as our Conservator, and are not managed to maximize stockholder returns. FHFA determines our strategic direction. FHFA has required us to make changes to our business that have adversely affected our financial results, and could require us to make additional changes at any time. Other agencies of the U.S. government and Congress also could require us to take actions that adversely affect our business and financial results.\nFHFA may require us to provide additional support for the mortgage market in a manner that serves our public mission, but that adversely affects our financial results, such as investing in the common securitization platform or engaging in more expensive foreclosure prevention efforts. From time to time, FHFA and Treasury have prevented us from engaging in business activities or transactions that we believe would benefit our business and financial results, and may do so in the future. FHFA may require us to engage in activities that are operationally difficult to implement, such as building the common securitization platform, implementing the single (common) security, and other initiatives under the Conservatorship Scorecards. FHFA could also take a number of actions that could materially adversely affect us, such as limiting the amount of securities we could sell or further limiting the size of our mortgage-related investments portfolio.\nWe currently face a variety of different, and potentially competing, business objectives and FHFA-mandated activities (e.g., the initiatives we are pursuing under the Conservatorship Scorecards). It may be difficult for us to devote sufficient resources and management attention to these multiple priorities, some of which present significant operational challenges to us. See \u201cBUSINESS - Executive Summary - Our Primary Business Objectives\u201d for more information.\nThe Purchase Agreement and terms of the senior preferred stock include significant restrictions on our ability to manage our business, including limitations on the amount of indebtedness we may incur, the size of our mortgage-related investments portfolio, and the circumstances in which we may pay dividends, transfer certain assets, raise capital, and pay down the liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock. These limitations could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. As a result of the net worth sweep dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock, we cannot retain capital from the earnings generated by our business operations or return capital to stockholders other than Treasury. The Purchase Agreement prohibits us from taking a variety of actions without Treasury's consent. Treasury has the right to withhold its consent for any reason and is not required to consider any particular factors, including whether or not management believes that the transaction would benefit the company. The warrant held by Treasury, the restrictions on our business under the Purchase Agreement, and the senior status and net worth dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock also could adversely affect our ability to attract new private sector capital in the future should the company be in a position to do so.\nOur regulator may, and in some cases must, place us into receivership, which would result in the liquidation of our assets; if this occurs, there may not be sufficient funds to pay the claims of the company, repay the liquidation preference of our preferred stock, or make any distribution to the holders of our common stock.\nWe could be put into receivership at the discretion of the Director of FHFA at any time for a number of reasons set forth in the GSE Act. In addition, FHFA could be required to place us in receivership if Treasury is unable to provide us with funding requested under the Purchase Agreement to address a deficit in our net worth. Treasury might not be able to provide the requested funding if, for example, the U.S. government were shut down or reached its borrowing limit. For more information, see \"BUSINESS - Regulation and Supervision - Federal Housing Finance Agency - Receivership.\"\nA receivership would terminate the conservatorship. The appointment of FHFA as our receiver would terminate all rights and claims that our stockholders and creditors may have against our assets or under our charter arising as a result of their status as stockholders or creditors, other than the potential ability to be paid upon our liquidation. Unlike conservatorship, the purpose of which is to conserve our assets and return us to a sound and solvent condition, the purpose of receivership is to liquidate our assets and resolve claims against us. Bills considered by Congress in 2013 and 2014 provided for Freddie Mac to eventually be placed into receivership.\nIf our assets were liquidated, there is no assurance that there would be sufficient proceeds to pay the secured and unsecured claims of the company, repay the liquidation preference of any series of our preferred stock or make any distribution to the holders of our common stock. If we are placed into receivership and do not or cannot fulfill our guarantee to the holders of our mortgage-related securities, such holders could become unsecured creditors of ours with respect to claims made under our guarantee. Only after paying the secured and unsecured claims of the company, the administrative expenses of the receiver and the liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock would any liquidation proceeds be available to repay the liquidation preference of any other series of preferred stock. Finally, only after the liquidation preference of all series of preferred stock is repaid would any liquidation proceeds be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock.\nIf we are placed into receivership or no longer operate as a going concern, our basis of accounting would change to liquidation-based accounting. Under the liquidation basis of accounting, assets are stated at their estimated net realizable value and liabilities are stated at their estimated settlement amounts, which could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, the amounts in AOCI would be reclassified to earnings.\nFreddie Mac\nThe conservatorship and investment by Treasury have had, and will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our common and preferred stockholders.\nThe market price for our common stock and publicly traded classes of preferred stock declined substantially after we entered into conservatorship. As a result, the investments of our common and preferred stockholders lost substantial value, which they may never recover. Our shares could further diminish in value, and may not have any value in the long-term.\nThe conservatorship and investment by Treasury have had, and will continue to have, other material adverse effects on our common and preferred stockholders, including the following:\n\u2022\nNo voting rights during conservatorship. The rights and powers of our stockholders are suspended during the conservatorship and our common stockholders do not have the ability to elect directors or to vote on other matters.\n\u2022\nOur future profits will effectively be distributed to Treasury. Under the Purchase Agreement and the terms of the senior preferred stock, we are required to pay quarterly dividends to Treasury equal to the amount, if any, by which our Net Worth Amount exceeds a permitted Capital Reserve Amount that decreases to zero over time. Accordingly, our future profits will effectively be distributed to Treasury. Therefore, the holders of our common stock and non-senior preferred stock will not receive benefits that would otherwise flow from any such future profits.\n\u2022\nPriority of Senior Preferred Stock. The senior preferred stock ranks senior to the common stock and all other series of preferred stock as to both dividends and distributions upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company.\n\u2022\nDividends have been eliminated. The Conservator has eliminated dividends on Freddie Mac common and preferred stock (other than dividends on the senior preferred stock) during the conservatorship. In addition, under the Purchase Agreement, dividends may not be paid to common or preferred stockholders (other than on the senior preferred stock) without the consent of Treasury, regardless of whether we are in conservatorship.\n\u2022\nWarrant may substantially dilute investment of current stockholders. If Treasury exercises its warrant to purchase shares of our common stock equal to 79.9% of the total number of shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, the ownership interest in the company of our then existing common stockholders will be substantially diluted. Existing common stockholders have no assurance that, as a group, they will be able to control the election of our directors or the outcome of any other vote after the time, if any, that the conservatorship ends and the voting rights of the common stockholders are restored.\nCompetitive and Market Risks\nOur level of earnings in recent periods is not sustainable over the long term.\nThe level of our earnings in 2013 and 2014 is not sustainable over the long term. Our 2013 financial results included a very large benefit related to the release of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Our 2013 and 2014 financial results included large amounts of income from settlements of representation and warranty claims arising out of our loan purchases and settlements of non-agency mortgage-related securities litigation. We do not expect any future settlements of representation and warranty claims related to our pre-conservatorship loan purchases to have a significant effect on our financial results. Our 2013 financial results, particularly the level of loan loss provisioning, also benefited from a high level of home price appreciation.\nIn addition, declines in the size of our mortgage-related investments portfolio, as required by FHFA and the Purchase Agreement, will reduce our earnings over the long term. We are subject to significant limitations on our investment activity, including a requirement to reduce the size of our mortgage-related investments portfolio, and significant constraints on our ability to purchase or sell mortgage assets. These limitations will reduce the earnings capacity of our mortgage-related investments portfolio. In addition, many of our mortgage investments do not trade in a liquid secondary market. In some cases, the size of our holdings relative to normal market activity is large enough that, if we were to attempt to sell a significant quantity of these assets, market pricing could be significantly disrupted and the price we ultimately realize may be materially lower than the value at which we carry these investments on our consolidated balance sheets. We can provide no assurance that the cap on our mortgage-related investments portfolio will not, over time, force us to sell mortgage assets at unattractive prices or that our current strategies will not have an adverse impact on our business or financial results. For more information, see \u201cBUSINESS - Conservatorship and Related Matters - Limits on Investment Activity and Our Mortgage-Related Investments Portfolio.\u201d\nDue to the reduced earnings capacity of our mortgage-related investments portfolio, we will have to place greater emphasis on our guarantee activities to generate revenue. However, our ability to generate revenue through guarantee activities may be limited for a number of reasons. We may be required to adopt business practices that help serve our public mission and other non-financial objectives, but that may negatively affect our future financial results. We must obtain FHFA\u2019s approval to implement across-the-board increases in our guarantee fees, and there can be no assurance FHFA will approve any such increase requests in the future. The combination of the restrictions on our business activities and our potential inability to generate sufficient revenue through our guarantee activities to offset the effects of those restrictions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFreddie Mac\nOur single-family credit guarantee and multifamily mortgage portfolios are subject to mortgage credit risks, including mortgage credit risk relating to off-balance sheet arrangements; credit costs related to these risks could adversely affect our financial results.\nMortgage credit risk is the risk that a borrower will fail to make timely payments on a mortgage we own or guarantee, exposing us to the risk of credit losses and credit-related expenses. We are primarily exposed to mortgage credit risk with respect to the single-family and multifamily loans and securities that we own or guarantee. We are also exposed to mortgage credit risk with respect to securities and guarantee arrangements that are not reflected as assets on our consolidated balance sheets. These relate primarily to: (a) Freddie Mac mortgage-related securities backed by multifamily loans (e.g., K Certificates we guarantee); (b) certain single-family Other Guarantee Transactions; and (c) other guarantee commitments, including long-term standby commitments and liquidity guarantees.\nWe expect our single-family credit losses to remain elevated in the near term in part due to the substantial number of delinquent and underwater (i.e., where the borrower's debt on the property is greater than its market value) mortgage loans in our single-family credit guarantee portfolio that will likely be resolved. We also continue to have significant amounts of mortgage loans in our single-family credit guarantee portfolio with certain characteristics, such as Alt-A loans, interest-only loans, option ARM loans, loans with original LTV ratios greater than 90%, and loans to borrowers with credit scores less than 620 at the time of origination, that expose us to greater credit risk than other types of mortgage loans. See \u201cTable 45 - Certain Higher-Risk Categories in the Single-Family Credit Guarantee Portfolio\u201d for more information.\nOur loan loss reserves may not reflect the total of all future credit losses we will ultimately incur with respect to the single-family and multifamily mortgage loans we currently own or guarantee. Pursuant to GAAP, our reserves only reflect probable losses we believe we have already incurred as of the balance sheet date. Accordingly, it is likely that the credit losses we ultimately incur on the loans we currently own or guarantee will exceed the amounts we have already reserved for such loans. If we were to experience another recession or another sharp drop in home prices, it is possible that the credit losses we ultimately incur related to such an event could be larger, perhaps substantially larger, than our current loan loss reserves.\nWe use certain credit enhancements (e.g., mortgage insurance and risk transfer transactions) to mitigate some of our potential credit losses. However, such credit enhancements may provide less protection than we expect. Our ability to use certain types of risk transfer transactions (and the cost to us of doing so) could change rapidly, depending on market conditions. Some of our risk transfer transactions (e.g., STACRs and ACIS) are new, and it is uncertain if there will be adequate demand for these products over the long term. For more information, see \"NOTE 4: MORTGAGE LOANS AND LOAN LOSS RESERVES - Credit Protection and Other Forms of Credit Enhancement.\"\nFor more information on our mortgage credit risk with respect to single-family and multifamily loans and our use of credit enhancements, see \u201cMD&A - RISK MANAGEMENT - Credit Risk Overview - Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Framework and Profile\" and \" - Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Profile.\u201d\nWe face significant risks related to our delegated underwriting process for single-family mortgages, including risks related to data accuracy and mortgage fraud. Recent changes to the process could increase our risks.\nWe use a process of delegated underwriting for the single-family mortgages we purchase or securitize. In this process, our contracts with sellers describe mortgage eligibility and underwriting standards, and the sellers represent and warrant to us that the mortgages they sell to us meet these standards. We do not independently verify most of the information that is provided to us before we purchase a loan. This exposes us to the risk that one or more of the parties involved in a transaction (such as the borrower, seller, broker, appraiser, title agent, loan officer, lender or servicer) will misrepresent the facts about the underlying property, borrower, or loan, or otherwise engage in fraud. While we review a sample of these loans to determine if they are in compliance with our contractual standards, there can be no assurance that this will detect any misrepresented facts or deter mortgage fraud, or otherwise reduce our exposure to these risks. We are also exposed to fraud by third parties in the mortgage servicing function, particularly with respect to sales of REO properties, short sales, and other dispositions of non-performing assets.\nIn 2013 and 2014, we significantly revised our representation and warranty framework by relieving sellers of certain repurchase obligations in specific cases. We may face greater exposure to credit and other losses under this revised framework because our ability to seek recovery or repurchase from the seller is more limited. As a result of these changes to the framework, it is critical that we identify breaches of representations and warranties early in the life of the loan. This represents a significant change in practice and presents a number of operational and systems challenges. We have not fully implemented systems and processes designed to do this. Once fully implemented, there is a risk that such systems and processes will not enable us to identify all breaches within the accelerated timelines. For more information, see \u201cBUSINESS - Our Business - Our Business Segments - Single-Family Guarantee Segment - Underwriting Requirements, Quality Control Standards, and the Representation and Warranty Framework.\u201d\nFreddie Mac\nWe are exposed to significant credit risk related to the subprime, Alt-A, and option ARM loans that back the non-agency mortgage-related securities we hold in our mortgage-related investments portfolio.\nOur investments in non-agency mortgage-related securities include securities that are backed by subprime, Alt-A, and option ARM loans. We also hold non-agency mortgage-related securities backed by manufactured housing loans and home equity lines of credit. The credit performance of the loans underlying these non-agency mortgage-related securities has declined since 2007, and although it has stabilized in recent periods, it remains weak. Our net income could be adversely affected if the population of non-agency mortgage-related securities that we intend to sell were to change or increase, as we would be required to immediately recognize in earnings any unrealized losses on such securities. This population could change or increase for a number of reasons, including as a result of changes in economic condition or our plans for the securities.\nSince 2007, our net worth has at times been adversely affected by declines in the fair value of these investments. We may experience additional fair value declines and losses in the future due to a number of factors, including increased delinquency and loss rates on the underlying loans. The quality of the servicing performed on the underlying loans can significantly affect the performance of these securities, including the timing and amount of losses incurred on the underlying loans and thus the timing and amount of losses we recognize on our securities. Our ability to influence servicing performance is limited. In addition, there is a general lack of transparency in the market for the non-agency mortgage-related securities we hold, and the information disclosed by the trustees of the trusts that issued these securities is often not sufficient to allow us to adequately analyze decisions made by servicers that may directly affect the cash flows on such securities. The servicing of the loans is significantly concentrated among several specialty servicers, which may increase this risk. These specialty servicers are non-depository financial institutions, and may not have the same financial strength, internal controls or operational capacity as depository servicers. Any credit enhancements covering these securities may not prevent us from incurring losses.\nFor more information, see \u201cMD&A - CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS - Investments in Securities,\u201d \"RISK MANAGEMENT - Credit Risk Overview - Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Framework and Profile,\" and \"- Institutional Credit Risk Profile - Agency and Non-Agency Mortgage-Related Security Issuers.\"\nDeclines in U.S. home prices or other adverse changes in the U.S. housing market could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nOur financial results and business volumes can be negatively affected by declines in home prices and other adverse changes in the housing market. Although the single-family housing market improved in 2014, our credit losses remained high compared to levels before 2009, in part because home prices have experienced significant cumulative declines in many geographic areas since 2006. While we currently believe that home price growth rates will continue to moderate gradually during the near term and will return towards growth rates that are consistent with long-term historical averages (approximately 2 to 5 percent per year), there can be no assurance that this will occur.\nWe prepare internal forecasts of future home prices, which we use for certain business activities, including: (a) hedging prepayment risk; (b) estimating expected costs of new guarantee business; and (c) conducting portfolio activities. If future home prices are lower than our forecasts, this could cause the return we earn on new single-family guarantee business to be less than expected. In addition, home price changes that differ from our forecasts could affect prepayments and cause us to incorrectly hedge prepayment risk. This could also result in higher losses due to other-than-temporary impairments on our investments in non-agency mortgage-related securities (which would be recognized in earnings) or fair value declines on our investments in non-agency mortgage-related securities (which would be recognized in AOCI). For more information, see \u201cMD&A - CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS - Investments in Securities.\u201d\nOur business volumes (i.e., mortgage loan purchases and guarantee issuances) are closely tied to the rate of growth in total outstanding U.S. residential mortgage debt, the size of the U.S. residential mortgage market, and the amount of new mortgage originations. Total residential mortgage debt declined approximately 0.3% in the first nine months of 2014 (the most recent data available) compared to a decline of approximately 1% in 2013.\nWhile the multifamily market has experienced strong rent growth and occupancy trends in the past five years, these trends are not likely to continue at their current pace as apartment fundamentals are already very favorable, with vacancy rates near their lowest level since 2001. New supply of multifamily housing has been increasing in recent periods and could potentially outpace demand, which could result in excess supply and rising vacancy rates. Any softening of multifamily markets could cause delinquencies and credit losses relating to our multifamily activities to increase beyond our current expectations.\nWe could incur significant losses in the event of a major natural disaster or other catastrophic event.\nWe own or guarantee mortgage loans and own REO properties throughout the United States. A major natural or environmental disaster or similar catastrophic event in a regional geographic area of the United States could damage or destroy residential real estate underlying mortgage loans we own or guarantee, or negatively affect the ability of homeowners to continue to make payments on mortgage loans we own or guarantee. In turn, this could increase our serious delinquency rates and average loan loss severity in the affected region, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial\nFreddie Mac\nresults. Such an event could also damage or destroy REO properties we own. We may not have insurance coverage for some of these catastrophic events.\nWe depend on our institutional counterparties to provide services that are critical to our business, and our financial results may be adversely affected if one or more of our counterparties do not meet their obligations to us.\nWe face the risk that one or more of the institutional counterparties that has entered into a business contract or arrangement with us may fail to meet its obligations to us. Our important institutional counterparties include seller/servicers, mortgage insurers, insurers and reinsurers in ACIS transactions, bond insurers, and counterparties to derivatives and short-term lending and other funding transactions.\nA significant failure by a major institutional counterparty could harm our business and financial results in a variety of ways, as many of our major counterparties provide several types of services to us. The concentration of our exposure to our counterparties remains high, and we continue to face challenges in reducing our risk concentrations with counterparties. Efforts we take to reduce exposure to financially weak counterparties could concentrate our exposure to other counterparties, and increase our costs and reduce our revenue. Challenging market conditions have, at times, adversely affected the liquidity and financial condition of our counterparties, and some of our major counterparties have failed. Similar events may occur in future periods. Many of our counterparties are subject to increasingly complex regulatory requirements and oversight, which place additional stress on their resources.\nOur business could be adversely affected if counterparties to derivatives and short-term lending and other transactions fail to meet their obligations to us.\nWe have significant exposure to institutions in the financial services industry relating to derivatives, funding, short-term lending, securities and other transactions. These transactions are critical to our business, including our ability to: (a) manage interest rate and other risks related to our investments in mortgage-related assets; (b) fund our business operations; and (c) service our customers. In addition, we face the risk of operational failure of any of the clearing members, exchanges, clearinghouses, or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate these transactions. If a clearing member or clearinghouse were to fail, we could experience losses related to any collateral we had posted with such clearing member or clearinghouse to cover initial or variation margin. Similarly, if our counterparties in short-term lending transactions fail, we have exposure to losses if the transaction is unsecured or the value of the collateral posted to us is insufficient. We believe most of our derivative portfolio and cash and other investments portfolio counterparties are exposed to fiscally troubled European countries. It is possible that continued adverse developments in the Eurozone could significantly affect such counterparties. In turn, this could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nFor more information, see \u201cMD&A - RISK MANAGEMENT - Credit Risk Overview - Institutional Credit Risk Profile - Cash and Other Investments Counterparties\u201d and \u201c- Derivative Counterparties.\u201d\nOur financial results may be adversely affected if mortgage seller/servicers fail to perform their repurchase and other obligations to us.\nOur servicers perform the primary servicing function on our behalf with respect to single-family loans. Our servicers play an active role in our loss mitigation efforts, as we rely on them to perform loan workout activities as well as foreclosures on loans that they service for us. A decline in their performance could affect the overall quality of our credit performance (including by missing opportunities for repayment plans and mortgage modifications), which could significantly affect our ability to mitigate credit losses.\nOur credit losses could increase to the extent that our servicers do not fully perform their servicing obligations in a timely manner. The risk of such a decline in performance remains high due to a number of factors, including the continued high volume of seriously delinquent loans and the fact that the servicing function has become significantly more complex since the onset of the housing and economic downturn. We could be adversely affected if our servicers lack appropriate controls, experience a failure in their controls, or experience an operating disruption in their ability to service mortgage loans (including as a result of legal or regulatory actions or ratings downgrades). Any efforts we take to attempt to improve our servicers\u2019 performance (such as requiring that they pay us compensatory fees for underperformance) could adversely affect our relationships with such servicers, many of which also sell loans to us.\nIf a servicer does not fulfill its servicing obligations (including its repurchase or other responsibilities), we may seek to recover the amounts that such servicer owes us, such as by attempting to sell the applicable mortgage servicing rights to a different servicer and applying the proceeds to such owed amounts. However, we face the risk that we might not receive a sufficient price for the mortgage servicing rights or that we may be unable to find buyers who are willing to assume the representations and warranties of the former servicer and who have sufficient capacity to service the affected mortgages. This option may be difficult to accomplish with respect to our larger seller/servicers due to the operational and capacity challenges presented by transfers of large servicing portfolios.\nWe require seller/servicers to make certain representations and warranties regarding the loans they sell to us and/or service for us. If loans are sold to us in breach of those representations and warranties, we may have the contractual right to require the seller/servicer to repurchase those loans from us. We also may have other contractual remedies, including the right\nFreddie Mac\nto be indemnified against losses on the loans. We have similar rights and remedies with respect to loans that seller/servicers service on our behalf. If a seller/servicer does not satisfy its contractual obligations to us with respect to a loan, we will be subject to the full range of credit risks if the loan fails to perform, including the risk that a mortgage insurer may deny or rescind coverage on the loan (if the loan is insured) and the risk that we will incur credit losses on the loan through the workout or foreclosure process. It may be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to enforce (through the exercise of contractual remedies, including legal proceedings) a seller/servicer's repurchase obligations, in the event a seller/servicer fails to perform such obligations.\nDuring 2013 and 2014, we entered into a number of agreements with sellers to resolve certain existing and future repurchase obligations, and we may enter into additional agreements with sellers or servicers in the future. The amounts we receive under any such agreements may be less than the losses we ultimately incur on the underlying loans.\nIf, as we expect, origination volume remains low and there is a change in the mix of originations (refinance vs. purchase) in 2015, the competitive and financial pressures on single-family sellers and servicers could increase, thereby increasing our counterparty risk with respect to these entities.\nOver the last several years, our exposure to non-depository and smaller financial institutions has increased. We are acquiring a greater portion of our single-family business volume directly from these types of institutions. In addition, specialty servicers (i.e., companies that specialize in servicing troubled loans) service a large share of our single-family loans, and many of these specialty servicers are non-depository financial institutions. These non-depository and smaller financial institutions may not have the same financial strength, internal controls or operational capacity as our large single-family mortgage seller and servicer counterparties (which are depository institutions). As a result, we face increased risk that these counterparties could fail to perform their obligations to us. In particular, non-depository servicers have experienced rapid growth in their servicing portfolios in the last several years. This could expose us to increased risks in the event that the rapid growth results in operational strains that adversely affect their servicing performance or weakens their financial strength. Certain non-depository specialty servicers, particularly subsidiaries and/or affiliates of Ocwen Financial Corp., have recently been the subject of significant adverse regulatory scrutiny, and Ocwen\u2019s credit rating has been downgraded.\nOur seller/servicers also have a significant role in servicing loans in our multifamily mortgage portfolio. We are exposed to the risk that multifamily seller/servicers could come under financial pressure, which could potentially cause degradation in the quality of the servicing they provide us, including their monitoring of each property\u2019s financial performance and physical condition.\nFor more information, see \u201cMD&A - RISK MANAGEMENT - Credit Risk Overview -Institutional Credit Risk Profile - Single-family Mortgage Seller/Servicers\u201d and \u201c- Multifamily Mortgage Seller/Servicers.\u201d\nOur losses could increase if more of our mortgage or bond insurers become insolvent or fail to perform their obligations to us.\nWe are unlikely to receive full payment of our claims from several of our mortgage insurers (that insure some of the single-family mortgages we purchase or guarantee) and bond insurers (that insure certain of the non-agency mortgage-related securities we hold), as they are insolvent or are not paying us in full for claims under mortgage and bond insurance policies. Instead, a significant portion of their claims are generally recorded by us as deferred payment obligations. It is possible that these companies may never pay us in full for our claims. For more information, see \u201cNOTE 15: CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT AND OTHER RISKS - Mortgage Insurers\u201d and \u201c- Bond Insurers.\u201d\nWe also remain exposed to the risk that some of our other mortgage or bond insurance counterparties could become insolvent or fail to fully perform their obligations to us. The weakened financial condition and liquidity position of many of these other counterparties increases the risk that they will fail to fully reimburse us for claims under the insurance policies.\nAs a guarantor, we remain responsible for the payment of principal and interest if a mortgage insurer fails to meet its obligations to reimburse us for claims. Thus, if any of our mortgage insurers fails to fulfill its obligations, we could experience increased credit losses. In addition, if a regulator determined that a mortgage insurer lacked sufficient capital to pay all claims when due, the regulator could take action that might affect the timing and amount of claim payments made to us. A regulator could also restrict an insurer's ability to write new business.\nIn the event a mortgage insurer falls out of compliance with regulatory capital requirements, it may attempt various strategies (such as a corporate restructuring or raising additional capital) designed to enable it to continue to write new business. There can be no assurance that any such restructuring or recapitalization will enable payment in full of all of our claims in the future.\nA mortgage insurer may make business decisions that could increase the risk that the insurer would be unable to fully perform its obligations to us. For example, an insurer could improperly forecast the risks associated with a given group of loans, which could lead the insurer to charge lower prices for insuring those loans than are necessary to cover the risk. Over the long term, this could result in the insurer not having sufficient financial resources to pay all claims when due.\nIf a bond insurer were to become insolvent, it is likely that we would not fully collect our claims from the insurer and that payment of such claims could be delayed significantly. This would affect our ability to recover certain unrealized losses on our\nFreddie Mac\ninvestments in non-agency mortgage-related securities. We evaluate the expected recovery from primary bond insurance policies as part of our impairment analysis for our investments in securities. If a bond insurer\u2019s performance with respect to its obligations on our investments in securities is worse than expected, this could contribute to additional net impairment of those securities.\nFor more information, see \u201cMD&A - RISK MANAGEMENT - Credit Risk Overview - Institutional Credit Risk Profile - Mortgage Insurers\u201d and \u201c- Bond Insurers.\u201d\nThe loss of business volume could result in a decline in our market share and revenues.\nOur business depends on our ability to acquire a steady flow of mortgage loans. We purchase a significant percentage of our single-family mortgages from several large mortgage originators. Similarly, we acquire a significant portion of our multifamily mortgage loans from several large lenders.\nWe enter into mortgage purchase commitments with many of our single-family customers that are typically less than one year in duration. The loss of business from any one of our major lenders could adversely affect our market share and our revenues.\nOur charter requires that single-family mortgages with LTV ratios above 80% at the time of purchase be covered by mortgage insurance or other credit enhancements. If the availability of mortgage insurance for loans with LTV ratios above 80% is reduced, we may be restricted in our ability to purchase or securitize such loans. This could reduce our overall volume of new business.\nCompetition from banking and non-banking companies may harm our business.\nCompetition in the secondary mortgage market combined with a decline in the amount of residential mortgage debt outstanding may make it more difficult for us to purchase mortgages. Furthermore, competitive pricing pressures may make our products less attractive in the market and negatively affect our financial results. Increased competition from Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, FHA/VA, and new entrants may alter our product mix, lower our volumes, and reduce our revenues on new business.\nWe also compete with other financial institutions that retain or securitize mortgages, such as commercial and investment banks, dealers, thrift institutions, and insurance companies. In recent years, FHFA took a number of actions designed to encourage these other financial institutions to increase their activities in the mortgage market (e.g., increasing our guarantee fees in 2012), and could take additional actions in the future.\nBecause of these actions and given that our base fees charged for our guarantee do not vary for differing LTV ratios or credit scores, there is a risk that financial institutions may buy, or originate, and then retain loans on their balance sheet, or otherwise seek to structure financial transactions that result in our loan purchases having a higher proportion of lower credit scores and higher LTV ratios. While we compensate ourselves for higher levels of risk through charging of upfront delivery fees, the seller may elect to retain loans with better credit characteristics, which could result in us having lower overall purchase volumes, revenues, and returns (as a result of a more adverse credit risk profile).\nFHFA is also Conservator of Fannie Mae, our primary competitor, and FHFA\u2019s actions as Conservator of both companies could affect competition between us and Fannie Mae. It is possible that FHFA could require us and Fannie Mae to take a uniform approach that, because of differences in our respective businesses, could place Freddie Mac at a competitive disadvantage to Fannie Mae. FHFA may also prevent us from taking actions that could provide us with a competitive advantage.\nWe could be prevented from competing efficiently and effectively by competitors who use their patent portfolios to prevent us from using necessary business processes and products, or require us to pay significant royalties to use those processes and products.\nAs multifamily market fundamentals have improved over recent years, more life insurers, banks, CMBS conduits, and other market participants have increased their activities in the multifamily market, and as a result we have faced increased competition. In addition, FHFA may take actions that could encourage further competition.\nOur activities may be adversely affected by limited availability of financing and increased funding costs.\nThe amount, type and cost of our unsecured funding, including financing from other financial institutions and the capital markets, directly affects our interest expense and results of operations. A number of factors could make such financing more difficult to obtain, more expensive or unavailable on any terms, or could cause spreads to widen, both domestically and internationally, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in U.S. government support for us;\n\u2022\nreduced demand for our debt securities;\nFreddie Mac\n\u2022\ncompetition for debt funding from other debt issuers; and\n\u2022\nother market factors.\nOur ability to obtain funding in the public unsecured debt markets or by pledging mortgage-related and other securities as collateral to other institutions could cease or change rapidly, and the cost of available funding could increase significantly, due to changes in market interest rates, market confidence, operational risks and other factors. We may incur costs, including potentially higher funding costs, for our liquidity management practices and procedures. There can be no assurance that such practices and procedures would provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our ongoing cash obligations under all circumstances. In particular, we believe that our liquidity contingency plans may be difficult or impossible to execute during a liquidity crisis or period of significant market turmoil. If we cannot access the unsecured debt markets, our ability to repay maturing indebtedness and fund our operations could be eliminated or significantly impaired, as our alternative sources of liquidity (e.g., cash and other investments) may not be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.\nWe make extensive use of the Federal Reserve's payment system in our business activities. The Federal Reserve requires that we fully fund accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to the extent necessary to cover cash payments on our debt and mortgage-related securities each day, before the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, acting as our fiscal agent, will initiate such payments. Although we seek to maintain sufficient intraday liquidity to fund our activities through the Federal Reserve's payment system, we have limited access to cash once the debt markets are closed for the day. Insufficient cash may cause our account to be overdrawn, potentially resulting in penalties and reputational harm.\nProlonged wide spreads on long-term debt could cause us to reduce our long-term debt issuances and increase our reliance on short-term and callable debt issuances. This increased reliance could increase rollover risk (i.e., the risk that we may be unable to refinance our debt when it becomes due) and result in a greater use of derivatives. This greater use of derivatives could increase the volatility of our comprehensive income.\nOur mortgage-related investments portfolio has contracted significantly since we entered into conservatorship. A significant portion of the assets remaining in the portfolio are those we consider to be less liquid, and our ability to use these assets as a significant source of liquidity (for example, through sales or use as collateral in secured lending transactions) is limited.\nWe pay net worth sweep dividends to Treasury on the senior preferred stock on a quarterly basis. The amount of the net worth sweep dividend could vary substantially from quarter to quarter for a number of reasons, including as a result of non-cash changes in net worth. It is possible that, due to non-cash increases in net worth, the amount of our dividend for a quarter could exceed the amount of available cash, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nChanges in U.S. Government Support\nTreasury supports us through the Purchase Agreement and Treasury\u2019s ability to purchase up to $2.25 billion of our obligations under its permanent statutory authority. Unlike certain of our competitors, we do not have access to the Federal Reserve's discount window. Changes or perceived changes in the U.S. government\u2019s support of us could have a severe negative effect on our access to the unsecured debt markets and our debt funding costs. While we believe that the support provided by Treasury pursuant to the Purchase Agreement currently enables us to maintain our access to the unsecured debt markets and to have adequate liquidity to conduct our normal business activities, our access to the unsecured debt markets and the costs of our debt funding could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: (a) uncertainty about the future of the GSEs; (b) debt investors' concerns that the risk of receivership is increasing; and (c) future draws that significantly reduce the amount of available funding remaining under the Purchase Agreement. For more information, see \u201cMD&A - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - Capital Resources, the Purchase Agreement, and the Dividend Obligation on the Senior Preferred Stock.\u201d\nDemand for Debt Funding\nIf investor demand for our debt securities were to decrease, our liquidity, business, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The willingness of domestic and foreign investors to purchase and hold our debt securities can be influenced by many factors, including changes in the world economy, changes in foreign-currency exchange rates, regulatory and political factors, as well as the availability of and investor preferences for other investments. If investors were to divest their holdings or reduce their purchases of our debt securities, our funding costs could increase and our business activities could be curtailed. The market for our debt securities may become less liquid as the size of our mortgage-related investments portfolio declines, as we will be issuing fewer debt securities. This could lead to a decrease in demand for our debt securities and an increase in our funding costs.\nCompetition for Debt Funding\nWe compete for debt funding with Fannie Mae, the FHLBs, and other institutions. Competition for debt funding from these entities can vary with changes in economic, financial market, and regulatory environments. Increased competition for debt funding may result in a higher cost to finance our business, which could negatively affect our financial results. See \u201cMD&A - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - Liquidity - Other Debt Securities\u201d for a description of our debt\nFreddie Mac\nissuance programs. Our funding costs and liquidity contingency plans may also be affected by changes in the amount of, and demand for, debt issued by Treasury.\nAny downgrade in the credit ratings of the U.S. government would likely be followed by a downgrade in our credit ratings. A downgrade in the credit ratings of our debt could adversely affect our liquidity and other aspects of our business.\nNationally recognized statistical rating organizations play an important role in determining the availability and cost of funding by means of the ratings they assign to issuers and their debt. Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. We currently receive ratings from three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (S&P, Moody\u2019s, and Fitch) for our unsecured debt. These ratings are primarily based on the support we receive from Treasury, and therefore are affected by changes in the credit ratings of the U.S. government. Any downgrade in the credit ratings of the U.S. government would be expected to be followed by or accompanied by a downgrade in our credit ratings. In addition to a downgrade in the credit ratings of or outlook on the U.S. government, a number of other events could adversely affect our debt credit ratings, including actions by governmental entities, changes in government support for us, future GAAP losses, and additional draws under the Purchase Agreement. Any such downgrades could lead to major disruptions in the mortgage and financial markets and to our business due to lower liquidity, higher borrowing costs, lower asset values, and higher credit losses, and could cause us to experience net losses and net worth deficits.\nFor more information, see \u201cMD&A - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - Liquidity - Credit Ratings.\u201d\nA significant decline in the price performance of or demand for our PCs could have an adverse effect on the volume and/or profitability of our new single-family guarantee business. The profitability of our multifamily business could be adversely affected by a significant decrease in demand for K Certificates.\nThe price performance of our PCs relative to comparable Fannie Mae securities is one of Freddie Mac\u2019s more significant risks and competitive issues, with both short- and long-term implications. Our PCs are an integral part of our mortgage purchase program. Our competitiveness in purchasing single-family mortgages from our seller/servicers, and thus the volume and/or profitability of our new single-family guarantee business, can be directly affected by the price performance of our PCs relative to comparable Fannie Mae securities.\nThe profitability of our securitization financing and our ability to compete for mortgage purchases are affected by the price differential between PCs and comparable Fannie Mae securities. Freddie Mac fixed-rate PCs provide for faster scheduled monthly remittance of mortgage principal and interest payments to investors than Fannie Mae fixed-rate securities. However, our PCs have typically traded at prices below the level that we believe reflects the full value of their faster monthly remittance cycle, resulting in a pricing discount relative to comparable Fannie Mae securities. This difference in relative pricing creates an economic incentive for sellers to conduct a disproportionate share of their single-family business with Fannie Mae and negatively affects the financial performance of our business.\nThere may not be a liquid market for our PCs, which could adversely affect the price performance of PCs and our single-family market share. A significant reduction in our market share, and thus in the volume of mortgage loans that we securitize, or a reduction in the trading volume of our PCs, could further reduce the liquidity of our PCs. While we may employ a variety of strategies in an effort to support the liquidity and price performance of our PCs and may consider additional strategies, any such strategies may fail or adversely affect our business, or we may cease such activities if deemed appropriate. In addition, we believe the liquidity-related price differences between our PCs and comparable Fannie Mae securities are, in part, the result of factors that are largely outside of our control. (For example, the level of the Federal Reserve\u2019s purchases of agency mortgage-related securities could affect the demand for and values of our PCs.) Thus, while we may employ strategies in an effort to address the liquidity-related price differences, we believe the strategies currently available to us may not reduce or eliminate these price differences over the long-term. A curtailment of mortgage-related investments portfolio purchases, sales, or retention activities may result in a decline in the volume and/or profitability of our new single-family guarantee business, lower comprehensive income, and an accelerated decline in the size of our total mortgage portfolio.\nIn certain circumstances, we compensate customers for the difference in price between our PCs and comparable Fannie Mae securities by reducing our guarantee fees, and this could adversely affect the volume and/or profitability of our new single-family guarantee business. We also incur costs in connection with our efforts to support the liquidity and price performance of our PCs, including by engaging in transactions that yield less than our target rate of return. For more information, see \u201cBUSINESS - Our Business - Our Business Segments - Single-Family Guarantee Segment - Securitization Activities\u201d and \u201c- Investments Segment - Market Presence and PC Support Activities.\u201d\nIn accordance with FHFA\u2019s 2014 Strategic Plan and the 2014 and 2015 Conservatorship Scorecards, we are working towards the development of a single (common) security, which is designed to reduce the price performance disparities between Freddie Mac mortgage-related securities and Fannie Mae mortgage-related securities. This initiative is complex and involves significant cost and operational risk, and may require us to align our business processes more closely with those of Fannie Mae. There can be no assurance that this initiative will succeed in reducing the trading value disparities.\nOur current Multifamily business model is highly dependent on our ability to finance purchased loans through securitization into K Certificates. A significant decrease in demand for K Certificates could have an adverse impact on the\nFreddie Mac\nprofitability of the Multifamily business to the extent that our holding period for the loans increases and we are exposed to credit and market risks for a longer period of time. We employ a variety of strategies in an effort to support the liquidity of our K Certificates, and may consider additional strategies if deemed appropriate. From time to time, we purchase and sell both guaranteed K Certificates and related unguaranteed CMBS through our mortgage-related investments portfolio.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, our results of operations and net worth.\nOur investment activities and credit guarantee activities expose us to interest rate and other market risks, including prepayment risk. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest yield, the value of our mortgage assets and derivatives, and the prepayment rate on mortgage loans we own or guarantee. We incur costs in connection with our efforts to manage these risks.\nOur financial results can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates and changes in yield curves, especially results driven by financial instruments that are measured at fair value for accounting purposes either through earnings or in AOCI. These instruments include derivatives, trading securities, available-for-sale securities, loans held-for-sale, and loans and debt with the fair value option elected. In particular, while fair value changes in derivatives from fluctuations in interest rates, yield curves, and implied volatility affect comprehensive income, fair value changes in several of the types of assets and liabilities being economically hedged do not affect comprehensive income. Therefore, there can be timing mismatches affecting current period earnings, which may not be reflective of the economics of our business. When interest rates decrease, pay-fixed swaps decrease in value and receive-fixed swaps increase in value (with the opposite being true when interest rates increase).\nChanges in interest rates may affect mortgage and debt spreads and also affect prepayment projections, thus potentially affecting the fair value of our assets, including our investments in mortgage-related assets. When interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate. An increased likelihood of prepayment on the mortgages underlying our mortgage-related securities may adversely affect the value of these securities.\nIncreases in interest rates could increase other-than-temporary impairments on our investments in non-agency mortgage-related securities. Higher interest rates can result in a reduction in the benefit from expected structural credit enhancements on these securities.\nWhen interest rates increase, our credit losses from loans with adjustable payment terms (e.g., ARM loans) may increase as borrower payments increase at their reset dates, which increases the borrower\u2019s risk of default. Rising interest rates may also reduce the opportunity for these borrowers to refinance into a fixed-rate loan. Many borrowers may have additional debt obligations (such as home equity lines of credit and second liens) that also have adjustable payment terms. Increases in a borrower's payment on these other debt obligations (due to rising interest rates or a change in amortization) may increase the risk that the borrower may default on a loan we own or guarantee.\nInterest rates can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including changes in the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. Federal Reserve policies directly and indirectly influence the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rates can also fluctuate as a result of geopolitical events or changes in general economic conditions, including events or conditions that alter investor demand for Treasury or other fixed-income securities.\nChanges in OAS could materially affect our results of operations and net worth.\nChanges in market conditions, including changes in interest rates, liquidity, prepayment and/or default expectations, and the level of uncertainty in the market for a particular asset class may cause fluctuations in OAS. Our financial results and net worth can be significantly affected by changes in OAS, especially results driven by financial instruments that are measured at fair value for accounting purposes either through earnings or in AOCI. These instruments include trading securities, available-for-sale securities, loans held-for-sale, and loans with the fair value option elected. A widening of the OAS on a given asset, which is typically associated with a decline in the current fair value of that asset, may cause significant fair value losses, and may adversely affect our near-term financial results and net worth. Conversely, a narrowing or tightening of the OAS is typically associated with an increase in the current fair value of that asset, but may reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities in mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities, and could increase the cost of our activities to support our market presence and the price performance of our PCs. Consequently, a tightening of the OAS may adversely affect our future financial results and net worth.\nWhile wider spreads might create favorable investment opportunities, we are limited in our ability to take advantage of any such opportunities due to various restrictions on our mortgage-related investments portfolio activities. See \u201cBUSINESS - Conservatorship and Related Matters - Limits on Investment Activity and Our Mortgage-Related Investments Portfolio.\u201d\nNegative publicity causing damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial results or net worth.\nNegative public opinion could adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers or otherwise impair our customer relationships, adversely affect our ability to obtain financing, impede our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, hinder our business prospects, or adversely affect the trading price of our securities. Perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, counterparties, and vendors, or the financial services and mortgage industries as a whole, may also adversely\nFreddie Mac\naffect our reputation. Damage to the reputation of third parties with whom we have important relationships may also impair market confidence in our business operations. In addition, negative publicity could expose us to greater regulatory scrutiny or adverse regulatory or legislative changes, and could affect changes that may occur to our business structure during or following conservatorship, including whether we will continue to exist.\nOur efforts to reduce foreclosures, modify loan terms and refinance mortgages may adversely affect our financial results.\nThe servicing alignment initiative, MHA Program (which includes HAMP and HARP), and other loss mitigation activities are key components of our strategy for managing and resolving troubled assets and lowering credit losses. However, our loss mitigation strategies may not be successful and our credit losses may remain high. The costs we incur related to loan modifications and other activities have been, and will likely continue to be, significant. For example, with respect to our non-HAMP loan modifications, we bear the full cost of the monthly payment reductions related to modifications of loans we own or guarantee, and all applicable servicer incentive fees.\nWe could be required or elect to make changes to our loss mitigation activities that could make these activities more costly to us, both in terms of credit expenses and the cost of implementing and conducting the activities. For example, we could be required to use principal forgiveness to achieve reduced payments for borrowers. This could further increase our costs, as we could bear some or all of the costs of such reductions.\nMany loans are in the trial period of HAMP or our non-HAMP loan modification programs. A number of these loans will fail to complete the applicable trial period or qualify for our other loss mitigation programs. For these loans, the trial period will have effectively delayed the foreclosure process and could increase our losses.\nMany of our HAMP loans have provisions for the interest rates, which initially were set at a below-market rate, to increase gradually until they reach the market rate that was in effect at the time of the modification. This increase in payments may increase the risk that these borrowers will default.\nMortgage modification initiatives, particularly any future focus on principal forgiveness, which at present we do not offer to borrowers, have the potential to change borrower behavior and mortgage underwriting. Principal reductions may create an incentive for borrowers who are current to become delinquent in order to receive a principal reduction. This incentive, coupled with continued high volumes of underwater mortgages, could significantly affect borrower attitudes towards homeownership, the commitment of borrowers to making their mortgage payments, the way the market values residential mortgage assets, the way in which we conduct business and, ultimately, our financial results.\nDepending on the type of loss mitigation activities we pursue, those activities could result in accelerating or slowing prepayments on our PCs and REMICs and Other Structured Securities, either of which could affect the pricing of such securities or the earnings from mortgage-related assets we hold in our Investments segment mortgage investments portfolio. In addition, loss mitigation activities may adversely affect our ability to securitize and sell the loans subject to those activities (e.g., modified single-family mortgage loans).\nDue to the impact of HARP and other refinance initiatives of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae on prepayment expectations, we could experience declines in the fair values of certain agency security investments classified as available-for-sale or trading and lower net interest yields over time on other mortgage-related investments. Furthermore, HARP and similar programs make it harder to estimate prepayments, which could adversely affect our ability to hedge our mortgage-related investments.\nWe are devoting significant internal resources to the implementation of the servicing alignment initiative and the MHA Program. The costs we incur related to these initiatives have been, and will likely continue to be, significant. The size and scope of these efforts may also limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities or corporate initiatives.\nFor more information on our loss mitigation activities, see \u201cBUSINESS - Our Business - Our Business Segments - Single-Family Guarantee Segment - Single-Family Loan Workouts and the MHA Program\u201d and \u201cMD&A - RISK MANAGEMENT - Credit Risk Overview - Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Framework and Profile - Managing Problem Loans.\u201d\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses and we may otherwise be adversely affected by delays and deficiencies in the single-family foreclosure process.\nWe have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by delays and deficiencies in the foreclosure process. The average length of time for foreclosure of a Freddie Mac loan significantly increased since the onset of the housing and economic downturn, particularly in states that require a judicial foreclosure process, and may further increase. Delays in the foreclosure process could cause our expenses to increase for a number of reasons. For example, properties awaiting foreclosure could deteriorate until we acquire ownership of them. This would increase our expenses to repair and maintain the properties. Such delays may also adversely affect the values of, and our losses on, the non-agency mortgage-related securities we hold. Delays in the foreclosure process may also adversely affect trends in home prices regionally or nationally, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nIt is possible that mortgage insurance claims could be reduced or denied if servicers do not follow proper procedures in addressing seriously delinquent borrowers, including if servicers do not complete foreclosures within required timelines.\nFreddie Mac\nDelays in the foreclosure process could create fluctuations in our single-family credit statistics. For example, delays could temporarily increase the number of seriously delinquent loans that remain in our single-family mortgage portfolio, which could result in higher reported serious delinquency rates and a larger number of non-performing loans than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe may experience further losses relating to our assets that could materially adversely affect our financial results, liquidity and net worth.\nWe experienced significant losses relating to certain of our assets in recent years, including from significant declines in market value, impairments of our investment securities, declines in the value of REO properties and impairments on other assets. We may experience additional losses relating to our assets, including those that are currently AAA-rated, and the fair values of our assets may decline in the future. This could adversely affect our financial results, liquidity, and net worth. We may decide to pursue certain mortgage-related investments portfolio strategies for economic reasons that could result in the immediate recognition of losses, such as paying a premium to repurchase debt or engaging in certain asset structuring activities that result in the write-off of premiums.\nWe had a net deferred tax asset of $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. In future periods we will continue to evaluate our ability to realize the net deferred tax asset. If future events significantly alter our current outlook, we may need to reestablish the valuation allowance. In addition, a reduction in corporate tax rates would result in a reduction in the net realizable value of our net deferred tax asset. If this occurs, we would incur additional income tax expense and might require additional draws under the Purchase Agreement, which could be significant. For more information, see \"MD&A - CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS - Deferred Tax Assets.\"\nThere may not be an active, liquid trading market for our equity securities.\nOur common stock and the publicly traded classes of our preferred stock trade exclusively on the OTCQB Marketplace. Trading volumes on the OTCQB Marketplace can fluctuate significantly, and may not be stable, which could make it difficult for investors to execute transactions in our securities and could cause declines or volatility in the prices of our equity securities.\nChanges in our accounting policies, as well as estimates we make, could materially affect how we report our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Certain of our accounting policies, as well as estimates we make, are \u201ccritical,\u201d as they are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make particularly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates, often regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from our estimates and the use of different judgments and assumptions related to these policies and estimates could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Because our financial statements involve estimates for amounts that are large, even a small change in our assumptions or methodology for making estimates can have a significant effect on the results for a reporting period. For a description of our critical accounting policies, see \u201cMD&A - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.\u201d\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our financial statements. The implementation of new or revised accounting guidance could result in material adverse effects to our net worth and result in or contribute to the need for additional draws under the Purchase Agreement. In addition, FHFA may require us and Fannie Mae to have the same independent public accounting firm. Either of these events could significantly increase our expenses and require a substantial time commitment of management.\nOperational Risks\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our ability to recruit and retain executives and other employees with the necessary skills to conduct our business has at times in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the actions taken by Congress, Treasury, and the Conservator (e.g., significant restrictions on compensation), or other government agencies, the uncertainty regarding the duration of the conservatorship, the potential for future legislative or regulatory actions that could significantly affect our existence and our role in the secondary mortgage market, and negative publicity concerning the GSEs. We face competition from inside and outside the financial services industry for qualified employees. An improving economy may put additional pressures on turnover, as more attractive opportunities become available to our employees. Accordingly, we may not be able to retain or replace executives or other employees with the requisite institutional knowledge and the technical, operational and other key skills needed to conduct our business effectively.\nIssues related to the MERS System could delay or disrupt foreclosure activities and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe MERS\u00ae System is an electronic registry that is widely used by seller/servicers, Freddie Mac, and other participants in the mortgage finance industry to maintain records of beneficial ownership of mortgages. The MERS System is owned and operated by MERSCORP Holdings, Inc., a privately held company, the shareholders of which include a number of\nFreddie Mac\norganizations in the mortgage industry (including Freddie Mac). A significant portion of the loans we own or guarantee are registered in the MERS System.\nNumerous lawsuits have been filed challenging foreclosures conducted using the MERS System. It is possible that adverse judicial decisions, regulatory proceedings or action, or legislative action could: (a) prevent us from using the MERS System, (b) delay or disrupt foreclosure of mortgages that are registered on the MERS System, or (c) create additional requirements for the transfer of mortgages. Any of these developments could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For example, we could be required to transfer mortgages out of the MERS System.\nWe could also be adversely affected if MERSCORP Holdings and its subsidiaries fail to apply prudent and effective controls and to comply with legal and other requirements in the foreclosure process.\nWeaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and in disclosure controls and procedures could result in errors and inadequate disclosures, and affect operating results.\nOur business could be adversely affected by control deficiencies or failures. Control deficiencies could result in errors in our financial statements, lead to inadequate or untimely disclosures, and affect operating results. For information about management's conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective and the related material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, see \u201cCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\u201d\nThere are a number of factors that may impede our efforts to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, including: (a) the nature of the conservatorship and our relationship with FHFA; (b) the complexity of, and significant changes in, our business activities and related GAAP requirements; (c) employee and management turnover; (d) internal corporate reorganizations; (e) data quality; and (f) servicing-related issues.\nEffectively designed and operating internal control over financial reporting provides only reasonable assurance that material errors in our financial statements will be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting increases the risk of a material error in our reported financial results and a delay in our financial reporting timeline.\nWe face risks and uncertainties associated with the models that we use for financial accounting and reporting purposes, to make business decisions, and to manage risks. Market conditions have raised these risks and uncertainties.\nWe face risk associated with our use of models for financial accounting and reporting purposes and for managing business risks. First, there is inherent uncertainty associated with model results. Second, we could fail to properly implement, operate, or use our models. Either of these situations could adversely affect our financial statements, financial and risk-related disclosures, and ability to manage risks.\nModels are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results. We use market-based information to construct our models. However, it can take time for data providers to prepare information, and thus the most recent information may not be available for use with the model. When market conditions change quickly and in unforeseen ways, there is an increased risk that our models are not representative of current market conditions. For example, models may not fully capture the effect of certain economic events or government policies, which makes it more difficult to assess model performance and requires a higher degree of management judgment. Our models may not perform as well in situations for which there are few or no recent historical precedents. We have adjusted our models in response to recent events, but there remains considerable uncertainty about model results. Our models rely on various assumptions that may be invalid, including that historical experience can be used to predict future results.\nWe face the risk that we could fail to implement, operate, adjust or use our models properly. We may fail to code a model correctly or we could use incorrect data. The complexity and interconnectivity of our models create additional risk regarding the accuracy of model output.\nWe use third-party models for certain purposes. While the use of such models may reduce risk (e.g., where no internal model is available), it may expose us to additional risk, as third parties typically do not provide us with proprietary information regarding their models. We also may have little or no control over the process by which the models are adjusted or changed. As a result, we may not fully account for the risks associated with the use of such models.\nManagement often needs to exercise judgment to interpret or adjust modeled results to take into account new information or changes in conditions. The dramatic changes in the housing and credit capital markets in recent years have required frequent adjustments to our models and the application of greater management judgment in the interpretation and adjustment of the results produced by our models. This further increases both the uncertainty about model results and the risk of errors in the implementation, operation, or use of the models.\nWe face the risk that the valuations, risk metrics, amortization results, loan loss reserve estimations, and security impairment charges produced by our models may be different from actual results, which could adversely affect our business results, cash flows, net worth, business prospects, and future financial results.\nWe also face the risk that we could make poor business decisions in areas where model results are an important factor, including loan purchases, securitizations and sales of loans, purchases and sales of securities, funding strategy, management\nFreddie Mac\nand guarantee fee pricing, interest-rate risk management, market risk management, credit risk management, quality-control sampling strategies for loans in our single-family credit guarantee portfolio, and representation and warranty and other settlements with our counterparties. Furthermore, any strategies we employ to attempt to manage the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective. See \u201cMD&A - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\u201d and \u201cQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK - Interest-Rate Risk and Other Market Risks\u201d for more information on our use of models.\nA failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our business, damage our reputation, and cause losses.\nWe face significant levels of operational risk due to a variety of factors, including the complexity of our business operations and the amount of change to our core systems required to keep pace with regulatory and other requirements.\nShortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems could lead to impairment of our liquidity, financial and economic loss, errors in our financial statements, disruption of our business, liability to customers, further legislative or regulatory intervention, or reputational damage. We have certain legacy systems that require manual support and intervention, which may lead to heightened risk of system failures.\nOur business is highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and manage and analyze significant amounts of information, much of which is provided by third parties. The transactions we process are complex and are subject to various legal, accounting, and regulatory standards. The types of transactions we process and the standards relating to those transactions can change rapidly in response to external events, such as the implementation of government-mandated programs and changes in market conditions. Our financial, accounting, data processing, or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled, adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions. Our systems may contain design flaws. The information provided by third parties may be incorrect, or we may fail to properly manage or analyze it. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions or new types of transactions or products could constrain our ability to pursue new business initiatives or improve existing business activities.\nWe also face increased operational risk due to the magnitude and complexity of the new initiatives we are undertaking, including our efforts to help build a new housing finance system (such as the development of the common securitization platform). Some of these initiatives require significant changes to our operational systems. In some cases, the changes must be implemented within a short period of time. Our legacy systems may also create increased operational risk for these new initiatives. Internal corporate reorganizations (e.g., relating to our implementation of an enhanced three-lines-of-defense risk management framework) may also increase our operational risk, particularly during the period of implementation.\nOur employees could act improperly for their own gain and cause unexpected losses or reputational damage. While we have processes and systems in place designed to prevent and detect fraud, there can be no assurance that such processes and systems will be successful.\nMost of our key business activities are conducted in our offices in Virginia and represent a concentrated risk of people, technology, and facilities. As a result, a power outage or other infrastructure disruption in the area near our offices could significantly adversely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations. A terrorist event or natural disaster in the area near our offices could have a similar impact. Any measures we take to mitigate this risk may not be sufficient to respond to the full range of events that may occur.\nThe threat landscape in cyber security is changing rapidly and growing in sophistication. We may not be able to protect our systems with complete assurance or fully protect the confidentiality of our information from cyber attack and other unauthorized access, disclosure, and disruption.\nOur operations rely on the secure receipt, processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and with our business partners. Like many corporations and government entities, from time to time we have been, and likely will continue to be, the target of attempted cyber attacks. Although we devote significant resources to protecting our various systems and processes, there is no assurance that our security measures will provide fully effective security. Our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to cyber attack, unauthorized access, supply chain disruptions, computer viruses or other malicious code, or other attempts to harm them or misuse or steal confidential information. If one or more of such events were to occur, this potentially could jeopardize or result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse or corruption of confidential and other information (including information of borrowers, our customers or our counterparties), or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or counterparties. This could result in significant losses or reputational damage, adversely affect our relationships with our customers and counterparties, negatively affect our competitive position, and otherwise harm our business. We could also face regulatory action. We might be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we might be subject to litigation and financial losses that are not fully insured. In addition, there can be no assurance that business partners, counterparties and governmental organizations are adequately protecting the confidential and other information that we share with them. As a result, a cyber\nFreddie Mac\nattack on their systems and networks, or breach of their security measures, may result in harm to our business and business relationships.\nWe rely on third parties for certain important functions. Any failures by those vendors and service providers could disrupt our business operations.\nAt times, we outsource certain key functions to external parties, including some that are critical to financial reporting, our mortgage-related investment activity, and mortgage loan underwriting. We may enter into other key outsourcing relationships in the future. If one or more of these key external parties were not able to perform their functions at all for a period of time, perform them at an acceptable service level, or handle increased volumes, our business operations could be constrained, disrupted, or otherwise negatively affected. Our use of vendors also exposes us to the risk of losing intellectual property or confidential information and to other harm. Our ability to monitor the activities or performance of vendors may be constrained, which makes it difficult for us to assess and manage the risks associated with these relationships.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nLegislative or regulatory actions could adversely affect our business activities and financial results.\nWe face significant risks related to legislative or regulatory actions, in addition to those discussed above in \u201cConservatorship and Related Matters - The future status and role of Freddie Mac are uncertain.\u201d We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to heightened supervision from FHFA, as our Conservator. Our compliance systems and programs may not be adequate to ensure that we are in compliance with all legal and other requirements. We could incur fines or other negative consequences for inadvertent or unintentional violations.\nOur business may be directly adversely affected by future legislative and regulatory actions at the federal, state, and local levels. Legislative or regulatory actions, including actions by FHFA as Conservator, could affect us in a number of ways, including by imposing significant additional compliance and other costs on us, limiting our business activities and diverting management attention or other resources. Judicial actions at the federal, state, or local level could have a similar effect. For example, we could be negatively affected by legislative, regulatory or judicial action that: (a) changes the foreclosure process of any individual state; (b) limits or otherwise adversely affects the rights of a holder of a first lien on a mortgage (such as through granting priority rights in foreclosure proceedings for homeowner associations); (c) expands the responsibilities of (and costs to) servicers for maintaining vacant properties prior to foreclosure; or (d) permits or requires principal reductions, such as allowing local governments to use eminent domain to seize mortgage loans and forgive principal on the loans. Our business could also be adversely affected by any modification, reduction, or repeal of the federal income tax deductibility of mortgage interest payments.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of the mortgage and financial services industries and could continue to affect us in substantial ways. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory changes could cause or require us to make further changes to our business practices, such as practices related to mortgage underwriting and servicing. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes new standards and requirements related to asset-backed securities, including recently finalized rules requiring sponsors of securitization transactions to retain a portion of the underlying loans\u2019 credit risk. These standards and requirements could adversely affect us, including by establishing additional requirements for securitization structures that are not fully guaranteed.\nLegislation or regulatory actions could indirectly adversely affect us to the extent such legislation or actions affect the activities of banks, savings institutions, insurance companies, derivative counterparties, securities dealers, and other regulated entities that constitute a significant portion of our customers or counterparties, or to the extent that they modify industry practices. Legislative or regulatory provisions that remove incentives for these entities to purchase our securities or enter into derivatives or other transactions with us could have a material adverse effect on our business results and financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Act and related current and future regulatory changes may continue to significantly change the business practices of our customers and counterparties, and it is possible that any such changes will adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, changes in business practices resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory changes could have a negative effect on the volume of mortgage originations or could modify or remove incentives for financial institutions to sell mortgage loans to us, either of which could adversely affect the number of mortgages available for us to purchase or guarantee.\nU.S. banking regulators have substantially revised the capital and liquidity requirements applicable to banking organizations, based on the Basel III standards developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Phase-in of the new bank capital and liquidity requirements will take several years and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which implementation of the new requirements by banking organizations may affect us. For example, the emerging regulatory framework could decrease demand for our securities and/or affect competition in the market for mortgage originations and servicing, with possible adverse consequences for our business results and financial condition.\nWe may make certain changes to our business in an attempt to meet our housing goals and subgoals.\nWe may make adjustments to our mortgage loan sourcing and purchase strategies in an effort to meet our housing goals and subgoals, including relaxing some of our underwriting standards and the expanded use of targeted initiatives to reach\nFreddie Mac\nunderserved populations. For example, we may purchase loans that offer lower expected returns on our investment and potentially increase our exposure to credit losses. Doing so could cause us to forgo other purchase opportunities that we would expect to be more profitable. If our current efforts to meet the goals and subgoals prove to be insufficient, we may need to take additional steps that could potentially adversely affect our profitability. FHFA has not yet published a final rule with respect to our duty to serve underserved markets. However, it is possible that we could also make changes to our business in the future in response to this duty. If we do not meet our housing goals or duty to serve requirements, and FHFA finds that the goals or requirements were feasible, we may become subject to a housing plan that could require us to take additional steps that could potentially adversely affect our profitability.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings that could result in the payment of substantial damages or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are a party to various claims and other legal proceedings. We also have been, and in the future may be, involved in government investigations and regulatory proceedings and IRS examinations. In addition, certain of our former officers are involved in legal proceedings for which they may be entitled to reimbursement by us for costs and expenses of the proceedings. We may be required to establish reserves and to make substantial payments in the event of adverse judgments or settlements of any such claims, proceedings, investigations or examinations. Any legal proceeding, governmental investigation, or IRS examination issue, even if resolved in our favor, could result in negative publicity or cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses. Furthermore, the costs (including settlement costs) related to these legal proceedings and governmental investigations and examinations may differ from our expectations and exceed any amounts for which we have reserved or require adjustments to such reserves. These various matters could divert management\u2019s attention and other resources from the needs of the business. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed against the U.S. government relating to conservatorship and the Purchase Agreement that could adversely affect us. See \u201cLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\u201d and \u201cNOTE 17: LEGAL CONTINGENCIES\u201d for information about these various pending legal proceedings.", "PERMNO": 75789, "SIC": 6111, "TIC": "FMCC"}
