{"cik": "1680378", "company": "SenesTech, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAs discussed immediately prior to Item 1 of Part I, \u201cBusiness\u201d under \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nThe impacts of the coronavirus pandemic could adversely affect our business, and other similar crises could result in similar or other harms.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in widespread travel and transportation restrictions and closures of commercial spaces, industrial facilities and other spaces and businesses in and across the United States and the world, including in the locations we operate or target sales. As a result, our business has been impacted and we could face continued or more adverse effects. In addition, our results and financial condition may be adversely affected by federal or state legislation, or other similar laws, regulations, orders or other governmental or regulatory actions or best practices, that would impose new restrictions on our ability to operate our business or customers to operate their businesses. For example, our sales and technical field forces have been restricted from traveling or limited in travel, which adversely affects our ability to sell our products and complete field studies. While we have implemented cautionary procedures at our manufacturing facility, there may be disruptions to our ability to manufacture due to current and additional workplace controls. Our customers may be less inclined or unable to purchase our products or continue product studies due to restrictions under which they may be operating. Those restrictions have been and are more severe in some jurisdictions, such as California. If financial markets tighten, we may have more limited ability to raise necessary financing. The COVID-19 pandemic is also placing a significant budgetary burden on federal, state and local governments, which may impede or delay their ability to purchase our products. We source some of our critical raw materials from Asia, and the coronavirus has caused supply chain disruptions, which could limit a timely supply of materials. Each of these could have negative effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Even if the coronavirus pandemic passes, another crisis with similar effects could develop and harm our business, financial results and liquidity. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our results of operations and financial condition is unknown at this time and will depend on future developments, including the ultimate severity and the duration of the pandemic, and further actions that may be taken by governmental authorities or businesses or individuals on their own initiatives in response to the pandemic.\nOur success is dependent on the successful commercialization of ContraPest.\nThe EPA granted registration approval for ContraPest effective August 2, 2016, and as of July 12, 2018, we have received registration for ContraPest in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. However, we have not yet had significant sales of ContraPest, which is our only product to date that is available for commercialization and the generation of revenue.\nContraPest and our other product candidates, if approved, may not achieve adequate market acceptance necessary for commercial success.\nEven following receipt of regulatory approval for ContraPest or future regulatory approval of our other product candidates, such products may not gain market acceptance. Market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf The potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative or complementary products;\n\u25cf The effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and those of our collaborators;\n\u25cf The efficacy and safety of such product candidates as demonstrated in trials;\n\u25cf The uses, indications or limitations for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u25cf Product labeling or product insert requirements of the EPA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf The timing of market introduction of our products as well as future competitive or alternative products;\n\u25cf Relative convenience and ease of use; and\n\u25cf Unfavorable publicity relating to the product.\nIf we cannot successfully commercialize our products, especially ContraPest, we will not become profitable.\nIf any of our approved product candidates fail to achieve sufficient market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenues or become profitable. The commercial success of ContraPest will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf The execution of a viable commercial strategy and the successful establishment of a commercial organization;\n\u25cf Our success in educating end users about the benefits, administration and use of ContraPest;\n\u25cf The effectiveness of our own or our potential strategic partners\u2019 marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations;\n\u25cf Convincing PMPs to deploy ContraPest in quantity as an enhancement to, or replacement of their current strategy of use of rodenticides;\n\u25cf Establishment of commercially viable pricing;\n\u25cf Our ability to manufacture quantities of ContraPest using commercially acceptable processes and at a scale sufficient to meet anticipated demand and enable us to reduce our cost of manufacturing; and\n\u25cf A continued acceptable safety profile of ContraPest.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. If we are unable to successfully commercialize ContraPest, we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues or profits to continue our business.\nWe will require additional capital to fund our operations. Failure to obtain this necessary capital if needed may force us to delay, limit, or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\nCommercialization of ContraPest and developing further product candidates, including conducting experiments and field studies, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval and commercializing any products approved for sale, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. We expect our expenses to continue and to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our commercialization activities. We may expand our operations, and as a result of many factors, some of which may be currently unknown to us, our expenses may be higher than expected. Securing additional financing may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates, including ContraPest. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\n\u25cf Significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our product candidates, including ContraPest;\n\u25cf Seek strategic partners for the manufacturing, sales and distribution of ContraPest or any of our other product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; and\n\u25cf Relinquish, or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nThe occurrence of any of the events described above would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects and on our ability to develop our product candidates.\nContraPest is the first product we have marketed, and if we are unable to establish and maintain an effective sales force and marketing and distribution infrastructures, or enter into and rely upon acceptable third-party relationships, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nWe continue to develop a functional infrastructure for the sales, marketing, and distribution of our products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an infrastructure may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market ContraPest and any other products that may be approved by the EPA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we must continue to build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for which we would incur substantial costs. If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and become profitable. Without an effective internal commercial organization or the support of a third party to perform sales and marketing functions, we may be unable to compete successfully.\nRisks Regulations Have on Our Business\nRegulatory approval processes of the EPA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business may fail.\nThe EPA review process for a product with one or more new active ingredients typically takes approximately two years to complete and approval is never guaranteed. In addition, we continue to seek approvals to expand labels and use designations for ContraPest to broaden its market and usability. Our efforts could fail to receive marketing approval from the EPA or, with respect to ContraPest or our product candidates, from a comparable foreign regulatory authority for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf Disagreement over the design or implementation of our trials;\n\u25cf Failure to demonstrate a product candidate is safe or works according to our claims;\n\u25cf Failure to demonstrate a product candidate\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks;\n\u25cf Disagreement over our interpretation of data;\n\u25cf Disagreement over whether to accept efficacy results from trials;\n\u25cf The insufficiency of data collected from trials to obtain regulatory approval;\n\u25cf Irreparable or critical compliance issues relating to our manufacturing process; or\n\u25cf Changes in the approval policies or regulations that render our data insufficient for approval.\nAny of these factors, some of which are beyond our control, could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully market any of our product candidates. Any such setback in our pursuit of regulatory approval could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nEven following receipt of any regulatory approval for ContraPest and our other product candidates, we will continue to face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven following receipt of any regulatory approval for ContraPest or our product candidates, our products will be subject to ongoing requirements by the EPA and comparable state and foreign regulatory authorities governing the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information.\nThe safety profile of any product will continue to be closely monitored by the EPA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities after approval. In addition, we may be required, from time to time, to provide further testing results and certifications to the EPA and state regulatory agencies for ContraPest.\nFor instance, we have found it challenging to produce applicable stability test results for certain of our active ingredients, due in part to the small quantities used in the final product, and continue to work with the EPA to develop appropriate biological or chemical measurements of product stability. Because our data continue to demonstrate the long-term efficacy of ContraPest, we believe that the testing is a matter we will resolve.\nIf the EPA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new information after approval of ContraPest or any other product candidate, or we are unable to adequately complete required testing and certification requirements, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf We may be forced to suspend marketing of such product;\n\u25cf Regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals of such product after certain procedural requirements have been met;\n\u25cf Regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of such product;\n\u25cf The EPA or other regulatory bodies may issue safety alerts, press releases or other communications containing warnings about such product;\n\u25cf The EPA may require the establishment or modification of restricted use or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require the establishment or modification of a similar strategy that may, for instance, restrict distribution of our product and impose burdensome implementation requirements on us;\n\u25cf We may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional trials;\n\u25cf We could be sued and held liable for harm caused;\n\u25cf We may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u25cf Our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nMoreover, existing government regulations may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of ContraPest or any other product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and/or be subject to different marketing requirements or fines or enhanced government oversight and reporting obligations, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur future success is also dependent on regulatory approval and commercialization of our other product candidates.\nWe are working on a semi-solid product as well as an alternative dispenser. We cannot commercialize our product candidates in the United States without first obtaining regulatory approval for each product and each use pattern from the EPA or, if applicable, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and from any related applicable state authorities. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate for a target indication, the law requires that applicants demonstrate through laboratory and field studies and related data showing that the product candidate will perform its intended function without causing unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. The EPA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require more information, including additional data to support approval that may delay or prevent approval.\nEven following receipt of any regulatory approval for ContraPest and our other product candidates, we will continue to be subject to regulation of our manufacturing processes and advertising practices.\nAs a manufacturer of pest control products, we are subject to continual government oversight and periodic inspections by the EPA and other regulatory authorities. If we or a regulatory agency discover problems with a facility where our products are manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing until certain procedural requirements have been met. The occurrence of any such event or penalty could limit our ability to market ContraPest or any other product candidates and generate revenue.\nIn addition, the EPA strictly regulates the advertising and promotion of pest control products, and these pest control products may only be marketed or promoted for their EPA approved uses, consistent with the product\u2019s approved labeling. Advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the U.S. will be heavily scrutinized by the EPA, other applicable state regulatory agencies and the public. Violations, including promotion of our products for unapproved or off-label uses, are subject to enforcement actions, inquiries and investigations, and civil, criminal and/or administrative sanctions imposed by the EPA.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent ContraPest or any other product candidates from being marketed in those jurisdictions.\nTo market and sell our products globally, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and maintaining compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties, and cost for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. Approval by the EPA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, but EPA approval may influence decisions by the foreign regulatory authority. If we are unable to obtain approval of ContraPest or for any of our other product candidates by regulatory authorities in the world market, the commercial prospects of that product candidate may be significantly diminished and our business prospects could decline.\nRisks Related to our Operations and Supply Chain\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business. If we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced sales, research and development, and other personnel. If one or more of our executive officers or key employees terminates employment or becomes disabled or experiences long-term illness, we may not be able to replace their expertise, fully integrate new personnel or replicate the prior working relationships, and the loss of their services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research, development and business objectives. Qualified individuals with the breadth of skills and experience in our industry that we require are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. Many of the other companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a more established history in the industry. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Our failure to attract or retain key personnel could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nWe have internal manufacturing capabilities to meet our current and near term forecasted demand for ContraPest, however, we must develop additional manufacturing capability or rely upon third parties to manufacture our products to meet future demand and our single location manufacturing operations could be disrupted.\nOur existing internal manufacturing platform is adequate for meeting our current and near term forecasted demand for ContraPest. We may be required to spend significant time and resources to expand these manufacturing facilities to fully meet future demand. If we are unable to develop full-scale manufacturing capabilities, we may not be able to meet demand of our products without relying on third party manufacturers, which could adversely affect our operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, if our manufacturing operations fail or becomes disrupted for any reason, including because of labor, disasters, and equipment malfunctions, among others, our ability to timely produce ContraPest may be adversely affected, which would harm our sales and reputation. We only operate in single location, which means we do not have back-up facilities to produce our products during a time when our manufacturing facility becomes unavailable.\nWe will need to expand our operations and grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 29 full-time employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we will need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, scientific, financial headcount and other resources. Our management, personnel, and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u25cf Identifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees with the expertise and experience we will require;\n\u25cf Managing our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;\n\u25cf Managing additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties;\n\u25cf Managing our trials effectively, which we anticipate being conducted at numerous field study sites;\n\u25cf Improving our managerial, development, operational, marketing, production and finance reporting systems and procedures; and\n\u25cf Expanding our facilities.\nOur failure to accomplish any of these tasks could prevent us from successfully growing our business.\nBusiness or supply chain disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses, particularly because we have limited suppliers and a critical ingredient is sourced from China.\nOur operations could be subject to a variety of potential business disruptions, including power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, fires, earthquakes, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or other interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. We do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Moreover, we rely on third parties to supply various ingredients and other items which are critical for producing our product candidates.\nWe currently use one supplier for each of our two active ingredients, triptolide and VCD. Our ability to produce our product candidates would be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a manmade or natural disaster or other business interruption. Because triptolide is sourced from China and other Asian countries, we have a greater risk of supply interruption, including as a result of tariff and trade disputes, or disruptive events like the outbreak of the Coronavirus. The ultimate impact on our operations from any business interruption impacting us or any of our significant suppliers is unknown, but our operations and financial condition would likely suffer adverse consequences. Further, any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from future prospects.\nWe are dependent on triptolide, a key ingredient for ContraPest, which has limited sources and must be in a very refined condition.\nIf we are unable to develop additional sources of or alternatives to triptolide, a key ingredient for ContraPest, our long-term ability to produce ContraPest at a cost effective price could be in jeopardy. If market demand for triptolide causes the price to increase beyond our ability to market at a competitive price or causes the quality of the refined ingredient to be less than needed for our production, our ability to commercialize ContraPest could be limited or delayed, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA variety of risks associated with marketing our product candidates internationally could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the U.S. and, in that case, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:\n\u25cf Differing regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\n\u25cf Unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf Economic weakness, including inflation or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u25cf Compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling internationally;\n\u25cf Foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u25cf Foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u25cf Difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf Workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u25cf Potential liability under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u25cf Challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u25cf Production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities internationally; and\n\u25cf Business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nRisks Relating to Protections of our Intellectual Property and Legal Actions\nIf we fail to obtain or protect intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing, and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. Where we deem appropriate, we seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and internationally related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. However, our financial resources constrain us from seeking protection in every instance, so we may rationalize and selectively pursue expensive patent protection. Patent positions can be highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and be the subject of litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patents, including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties, are highly uncertain.\nThe steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we are unable to obtain and maintain protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nWith respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications for any of our technologies or products will result in the issuance of patents that protect such technologies or products, or if our licensed patent will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Our pending patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Further, the examination process may require us to narrow the claims for our pending patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. Because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. and internationally. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents, or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, is expensive, difficult, and in some cases, may not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to any competitive advantage we may have.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u25cf Others may be able to make compounds that are the same as or similar to our future products but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u25cf We might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u25cf Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing on our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf Issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u25cf Our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the U.S. and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u25cf We may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable or otherwise protectable;\n\u25cf Employees may violate confidentiality and proprietary invention assignment agreements and we may not have the resources to enforce those agreements or otherwise enforce our patent rights; and\n\u25cf The patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur technology may be found to infringe third party intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to their patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights in technology that is important to us. The asserted claims and/or litigation could include claims against us, our licensors, or our suppliers alleging infringement of intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of the claims, they could be time consuming, resulting in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. We cannot assure you that licenses will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, because of the potential for significant damage awards, which are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims resulting in large settlements. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIf our product candidates, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to:\n\u25cf Obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf Redesign our product candidates or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u25cf Stop using the subject matter claimed to be held by others;\n\u25cf Pay damages; or\n\u25cf Defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of our product candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of a third party to manufacture or otherwise commercialize our own technology or products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from such third party. Licensing such intellectual property may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business that could result in significant harm to our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe could be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including actions arising from tort, contract or other claims. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d elsewhere in this filing for more information. Litigation is expensive, time consuming, and could divert management\u2019s attention away from running our business. The outcome of litigation or other proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty, and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm and/or significant monetary damages, injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our business as it is presently being conducted. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims and might not be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, regardless of merit or outcome, claims brought against us that are uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results and reduce the trading price of our stock.\nFor example, we have become aware that we were involved in a transaction in which an investor of the Company may have resold approximately 175,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement that was not declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As a result, it is possible that the SEC brings an action against us, or we may ultimately be responsible for an action for rescission by purchasers of the securities that were resold. If the SEC were to bring such an enforcement action against us, or if purchasers were to bring such an action for rescission, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the use of ContraPest and any of our other products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims from our product users, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf Decreased demand for any product that we may develop;\n\u25cf Termination of field studies or other research and development efforts;\n\u25cf Injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf Significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf Substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs;\n\u25cf Loss of revenue;\n\u25cf Diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u25cf The inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on products that had unanticipated side effects, including, without limitation, any potential adverse effects of our products on humans or other species. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to our Reporting and Cybersecurity\nWe have not fully assessed our internal control over financial reporting. If we experience material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our Common Stock.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 does not include an attestation report of the company\u2019s registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies. As a result, we have not yet fully assessed our internal control over financial reporting and are unable to assure that the measures we have taken to date, together with any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or to avoid potential future material weaknesses.\nIf we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, successfully remediate any existing or future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or identify any additional material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports and Nasdaq listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our stock price may decline as a result.\nPrivacy breaches and other cyber security risks related to our business could negatively affect our reputation, credibility and business.\nWe expect to begin making direct-to-consumer sales through our new e-Commerce tool, which depends on information technology systems and networks. We are also responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third party vendors for the storage, processing and transmission of personal and Company information. Consumers, lawmakers and consumer advocates alike are increasingly concerned over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and privacy. We do not control our third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that they have implemented reasonable security measures to protect our employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 identity and privacy, or that no electronic or physical computer break-ins or security breaches will occur in the future. Our systems and technology are vulnerable from time-to-time to damage, disruption or interruption from, among other things, physical damage, natural disasters, inadequate system capacity, system issues, security breaches, \u201chackers,\u201d email blocking lists, computer viruses, power outages and other failures or disruptions outside of our control. A significant breach of customer, employee or Company data could damage our reputation and our relationship with customers, and could result in lost sales, sizable fines, significant breach-notification costs and lawsuits, as well as adversely affect our results of operations. We may also incur additional costs in the future related to the implementation of additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security and privacy threats, or to comply with state, federal and international laws that may be enacted to address those threats.\nRisks Related to our Capital Stock, Funding and Trading in our Stock\nWe have incurred significant operating losses every quarter since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating losses in the future.\nInvestment in product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to become commercially viable or gain regulatory approval. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and debt financings as well as research grants. We have generated minimal revenue from product sales to date. We continue to incur significant sales, marketing, research, development, and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in every reporting period since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we reported net losses of $8.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit since inception of $104.2 million.\nSince inception, we have dedicated a majority of our resources to the discovery and development and marketing of our proprietary product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. The size of our losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate revenues. In particular, we expect to incur substantial and increased expenses as we:\n\u25cf Attempt to achieve market acceptance for our products;\n\u25cf Continue to establish an infrastructure for the sales, marketing and distribution of ContraPest and any other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval;\n\u25cf Scale up manufacturing processes and quantities to prepare for the commercialization of ContraPest and any other product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval;\n\u25cf Continue the research and development of ContraPest and our other product candidates, including engaging in any necessary field studies;\n\u25cf Seek regulatory approvals for ContraPest in various jurisdictions and for our other product candidates;\n\u25cf Expand our research and development activities and advance the discovery and development programs for other product candidates;\n\u25cf Maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n\u25cf Add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development and commercialization efforts and operations as a public company.\nWe may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our financial condition. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our financial condition. If ContraPest or any other product candidate does not gain or maintain sufficient regulatory approval, or if approved, fails to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nIf we are unable to continue as a going concern, our securities will have little or no value.\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm included in its opinion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 an explanatory paragraph referring to our net loss from operations and net capital deficiency and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available. If we encounter continued issues or delays in the commercialization of ContraPest or greater than anticipated expenses, our prior losses and expected future losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and negatively impact our ability to fund continued operations, obtain additional financing in the future and continue as a going concern. There are no assurances that such financing, if necessary, will be available to us at all or will be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to generate additional funds in the future through financings, sales of our products, licensing fees, royalty payments or from other sources or transactions, we will exhaust our resources and will be unable to continue operations. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate sufficient product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs primarily through the sale of equity securities and debt financings, and possibly through credit facilities and government and foundation grants. We may also seek to raise capital through third party collaborations, strategic alliances and similar arrangements. We currently do not have any committed external source of funds.\nRaising funds in the future may present additional challenges and future financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The terms of any financing arrangements we enter into may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. For example, during 2020, we completed equity financings that resulted in the issuance of shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase Common Stock, resulting in substantial dilution to the existing stockholders. Similarly, in the first quarter of 2021, we again issued shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase Common Stock, resulting in additional substantial dilution to the existing stockholders. We generally have raised capital as the opportunity arises.\nCertain of our agreements with investors and our outstanding warrants contain provisions that impose limitations on our ability to participate in certain variable rate transactions, including at-the-market transactions, which may limit our opportunities to obtain financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would dilute all of our stockholders, and if such sales occur at a deemed issuance price that is lower than the current exercise price of our outstanding warrants sold to investors in November 2017, the exercise price for those warrants would adjust downward to the deemed issuance price pursuant to price adjustment protection contained within those warrants. Our various warrants contain other terms that may affect our fundraising.\nThe incurrence of indebtedness through credit facilities would result in increased fixed payment obligations and, potentially, the imposition of restrictive covenants. Those covenants may include limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, and may impose limitations on our ability to acquire, sell, or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements or other marketing or distribution arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts, or grant others rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur share price may be volatile, which could subject us to securities class action litigation and your investment in our securities could decline in value.\nOur stock could be subject to wide fluctuation in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf Market acceptance and commercialization of our products;\n\u25cf Our being able to timely demonstrate achievement of milestones, including those related to revenue generation, cost control, cost effective source supply, and regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf Our ability to remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market;\n\u25cf Results and timing of our submissions with the regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf Failure or discontinuation of any of our development programs;\n\u25cf Regulatory developments or enforcements in the United States and non-U.S. countries with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u25cf Failure to achieve pricing acceptable to the market;\n\u25cf Regulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u25cf Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results or our continuing to sustain operating losses;\n\u25cf Competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u25cf Announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic arrangements, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u25cf Issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u25cf Announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts, particularly if our cash available for operations significantly decreases or if the financing efforts result in a price adjustment to certain outstanding warrants;\n\u25cf Fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u25cf Share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u25cf Disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u25cf Entry by us into any material litigation or other proceedings;\n\u25cf Sales of our Common Stock by us, our insiders, or our other stockholders;\n\u25cf Exercise of outstanding warrants;\n\u25cf Market conditions for equity securities; and\n\u25cf General economic and market conditions unrelated to our performance.\nFurthermore, the capital markets can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our Common Stock. In addition, such fluctuations could subject us to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. You may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nFuture sales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial number of our common shares could adversely affect the price of the shares and dilute stockholders.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock, or the perception that such sales will occur, could cause a decline in the market price of our Common Stock. This is particularly true if we sell our stock at a discount. As of March 29, 2021, we had 143,501 shares of our Common Stock subject to outstanding warrants that contain anti-dilution adjustments that provide for an adjustment to the exercise price for certain dilutive issuances of securities. If we offer or issue additional securities at a deemed price lower than the current exercise price of these outstanding warrants, these warrants will adjust pursuant to the price adjustment protection contained within these warrants. For example, our January 2020 registered direct offering resulted in an additional downward adjustment of the exercise price of these warrants from $19.00 per share to $7.126 per share and our inducement offering in October 2020 resulted in an additional downward adjustment of the exercise price of these warrants from $7.126 per share to $1.3659 per share. Any future issuance of Common Stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our Common Stock could cause a further downward adjustment of the exercise price of these warrants to the deemed issuance price if the issuance price is less than the exercise price of the warrants at the time of the new issuance.\nAlso, in the future, we may issue additional shares of our Common Stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into Common Stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangements, or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause our common share price to decline.\nAn active market in the shares may not continue to develop in which investors can resell our Common Stock.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which an active market for our Common Stock will continue to develop or be sustained, or how the development of such a market might affect the market price for our Common Stock. Market conditions in effect at the time you acquire our stock may not be indicative of the price at which our Common Stock will trade in the future. Investors may not be able to sell their Common Stock at or above the price they acquired it.\nIf securities or industry analysts, or other sources of information, do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research or other information about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock may depend on the research, reports and other information that securities or industry analysts, or other third-party sources of information, publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts or other third-party sources of information. From time to time inaccurate or unfavorable research or other information about our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock ownership may be published. We cannot assure that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If incorrect or misleading information is disseminated publicly by third parties about us, our stock price could decline.\nWe may not be able to comply with all applicable listing requirements or standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market and Nasdaq could delist our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards. On November 12, 2019, we received an initial deficiency letter from the listing qualifications staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) providing notification that the bid price for our Common Stock had closed below $1.00 per share for the previous 30 consecutive business days and that as a result our Common Stock no longer met the minimum bid price requirement for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. We were provided with an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until May 11, 2020, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. We implemented a 1-for-20 reverse stock split on February 4, 2020. On February 20, 2020 we received notification from Nasdaq that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.\nIn the event that we are unable to maintain compliance with the applicable Nasdaq listing requirements or standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common Stock could be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and which could cause the value of our Common Stock to decline. If our Common Stock is not eligible for listing or quotation on another market or exchange, trading of our Common Stock could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our Common Stock, and there would likely be a reduction in our coverage by security analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline further. In addition, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on a national securities exchange.\nOur corporate documents, Delaware law and certain warrants contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our certificate of incorporation currently provides for a staggered board of directors, whereby directors serve for three-year terms, with approximately one-third of the directors coming up for reelection each year. Having a staggered board will make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest, which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our board of directors. Additionally, most of our warrants provide a Black Scholes value-based payment to the warrant holders in connection with certain transactions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under these provisions, if anyone becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d we may not enter into a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with that person for three years without special approval, which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control. For purposes of Section 203, \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d means, generally, someone owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years, subject to certain exceptions as described in Section 203.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as that term is used in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in our Common Stock being less attractive to investors and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock or make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as that term is used in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, and exemptions from any rules that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on the financial statements. We currently intend to take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us under the JOBS Act, so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d For example, so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would have otherwise been required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us.\nBecause of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and future prospects may be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 16532, "SIC": 2870, "TIC": "SNES"}
