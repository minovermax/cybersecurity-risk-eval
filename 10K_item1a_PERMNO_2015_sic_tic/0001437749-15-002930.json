{"cik": "719413", "company": "HECLA MINING CO/DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risks and uncertainties, together with the other information set forth in this report, should be carefully considered by those who invest in our securities. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results and could decrease the value of our common or preferred stock or other outstanding securities.\nFinancial Risks\nA substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur revenue is derived from the sale of concentrates and dor\u00e9 containing silver, gold, lead and zinc and, as a result, our earnings are directly related to the prices of these metals. Silver, gold, lead and zinc prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nspeculative activities;\n\u2022\nrelative exchange rates of the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nglobal and regional demand and production;\n\u2022\npolitical instability;\n\u2022\ninflation, recession or increased or reduced economic activity; and\n\u2022\nother political, regulatory and economic conditions.\nThese factors are largely beyond our control and are difficult to predict. If the market prices for these metals fall below our production or development costs for a sustained period of time, we will experience losses and may have to discontinue exploration, development or operations, or incur asset write-downs at one or more of our properties. See Item 1. Business - Introduction for information on the average, high, and low daily closing prices for silver, gold, lead and zinc for the last five years. On February 16, 2015, the closing prices for silver, gold, lead and zinc were $17.27 per ounce, $1,229 per ounce, $0.83 per pound and $0.98 per pound, respectively.\nThe acquisition of Aurizon increased our exposure to gold price volatility.\nThe financial results of our Casa Berardi unit, obtained through the acquisition of Aurizon in June 2013, are highly sensitive to changes in the price of gold, and the acquisition of Aurizon increased the sensitivity of our results to such changes. Gold prices fluctuate and are affected by numerous factors, including expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, exchange rates, interest rates, global and regional political and economic crises and governmental policies with respect to gold holdings by central banks. The demand for and supply of gold affects gold prices but not necessarily in the same manner as demand and supply affect the prices of other commodities. The supply of gold consists of a combination of mine production and existing stocks of bullion and fabricated gold held by governments, public and private financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals. The demand for gold consists primarily of jewelry and investment demand. We do not use forward sale contracts, or other derivative products, to protect the price level of future gold sales at the Casa Berardi unit, and as a result, those sales are exposed to commodity price risk.\nAn extended decline in metals prices, an increase in operating or capital costs, mine accidents or closures, increasing environmental obligations, or our inability to convert exploration potential to reserves may cause us to record write-downs, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWhen events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we review the recoverability of the carrying value by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows, and recognizing impairment write-downs could negatively impact our results of operations. Metal price estimates are a key component used in the analysis of the carrying values of our assets, as the evaluation approach involves comparing carrying values to the average estimated undiscounted cash flows resulting from operating plans using various metals price scenarios. Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows for our long-lived assets also include an estimate of the market value of the exploration potential beyond the current operating plans. Because the average estimated undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying values of our long-lived assets, we did not record impairments as of December 31, 2014. However, if the prices of silver, gold, zinc and lead decline for an extended period of time, if we fail to control production or capital costs, if regulatory issues increase costs or decrease production, or if we do not realize the mineable ore reserves or exploration potential at our mining properties, we may be required to recognize asset write-downs in the future. In addition, the perceived market value of the exploration potential of our properties is dependent upon prevailing metals prices as well as our ability to discover economic ore. A decline in metals prices for an extended period of time or our inability to convert exploration potential to reserves could significantly reduce our estimates of the value of the exploration potential at our properties and result in asset write-downs.\nWe have had losses that could reoccur in the future.\nWe have had volatility in our net income (loss) reported in the last five years, as shown in Item 6. Selected Financial Data, including a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014. A comparison of operating results over the past three years can be found in Results of Operations in Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nMany of the factors affecting our operating results are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the volatility of metals prices; smelter terms; rock and soil conditions; seismic events; availability of hydroelectric power; diesel fuel prices; interest rates; foreign exchange rates; global or regional political or economic policies; inflation; availability and cost of labor; economic developments and crises; governmental regulations; continuity of orebodies; ore grades; recoveries; price speculation by certain investors; and purchases and sales by central banks and other holders and producers of gold and silver in response to these factors. We cannot foresee whether our operations will continue to generate sufficient revenue in order for us to generate net cash from operating activities. There can be no assurance that we will not experience net losses in the future.\nCommodity risk management activities could prevent us from realizing possible revenues or expose us to losses.\nWe periodically enter into risk management activities, such as financially-settled forward sales contracts, to manage the prices received on the metals we produce. Such activities are utilized in an attempt to partially insulate our operating results from changes in prices for those metals. However, such activities may prevent us from realizing possible revenues in the event that the market price of a metal exceeds the price stated in a forward sale contract. In addition, we may experience losses if a counterparty fails to purchase under a contract when the contract price exceeds the spot price of a commodity.\nWe utilize financially settled forward contract programs to manage the exposure to changes in silver, gold, lead and zinc prices contained in our concentrate shipments between the time of sale and final settlement, and to manage the exposure to changes in the prices of lead and zinc contained in our forecasted future concentrate shipments. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these base metals forward contract programs.\nOur profitability could be affected by the prices of other commodities.\nOur profitability is sensitive to the costs of commodities such as fuel (in particular as used at Greens Creek to generate electricity when hydropower is unavailable), steel, and cement. While the recent prices for such commodities have been stable or in decline, prices have been historically volatile and material increases in commodity costs could have a significant effect on our results of operations.\nOur accounting and other estimates may be imprecise.\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosure of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reporting periods. The more significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to:\n\u2022\nmineral reserves, mineralized material, and other resources that are the basis for future income and cash flow estimates and units-of-production depreciation, depletion and amortization calculations;\n\u2022\nfuture metals prices;\n\u2022\nenvironmental, reclamation and closure obligations;\n\u2022\nasset impairments;\n\u2022\nvaluation of business combinations;\n\u2022\nreserves for contingencies and litigation; and\n\u2022\ndeferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nFuture estimates and actual results may differ materially from these estimates as a result of using different assumptions or conditions. For additional information, see Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the risk factors set forth below: \u201cOur development of new orebodies and other capital costs may be higher and provide less return than we estimated,\u201d \u201cOur ore reserve estimates may be imprecise,\u201d \u201cOur environmental obligations may exceed the provisions we have made,\u201d and \u201cWe are currently involved in ongoing legal disputes that may materially adversely affect us.\u201d\nOur ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income.\nWe recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets, reducing the value of such assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted income from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Metal price and production estimates are key components used in the determination of our ability to realize the expected future benefit of our deferred tax assets. To the extent that future taxable income differs significantly from estimates as a result of a decline in metals prices or other factors, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, significant future issuances of common stock or common stock equivalents, or changes in the direct or indirect ownership of our common stock or common stock equivalents could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Future changes in tax law or changes in ownership structure could limit our ability to utilize our recorded tax assets. We currently have no deferred tax valuation allowances, with the exception of certain amounts related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards, and our current and non-current deferred tax asset balances as of December 31, 2014 were $12.0 million and $98.9 million, respectively. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our deferred tax assets.\nGlobal financial events may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nThe 2008 credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system and ensuing recession had an impact on our business and financial position, and similar events in the future could also impact us. The continuation or re-emergence of the financial crisis or recession, or disruption of key sectors of the economy such as oil and gas, may limit our ability to raise capital through credit and equity markets. The prices of the metals that we produce are affected by a number of factors, and it is unknown how these factors may be impacted by a global financial event.\nReturns for investments in pension plans and pension plan funding requirements are uncertain.\nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans for U.S. employees, which provide for defined benefit payments after retirement for most U.S. employees. Canadian employees participate in Canada's public retirement system, and are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension plans that we maintain for U.S. employees. The ability of the pension plans maintained for U.S. employees to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the plans. Returns, if any, on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions. A sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension plans.\nRisks Relating to Our Debt\nOur level of debt could impair our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our current debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had total indebtedness of approximately $521.6 million. Our level of debt and our debt service obligations could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our current debt obligations;\n\u2022\nreduce the amount of funds available to finance our operations, capital expenditures and other activities;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to economic downturns and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, including increased competition and demand for new products and services;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors that have lower leverage;\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nOur subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indenture governing our outstanding debt securities contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. We have $100 million in available capacity to be drawn from our revolving credit facility.\nIf new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries' existing debt levels, the risks associated with such debt that we currently face would increase.\nThe terms of our debt impose restrictions on our operations.\nThe indenture governing our outstanding debt securities includes a number of significant restrictive covenants. These covenants could adversely affect us by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs. These covenants will, among other things:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding debt securities and our other debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements, or require us to make divestitures;\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing additional funds.\nIn addition, utilization of our revolving credit facility would require us to comply with various covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the agreement governing our revolving credit facility that, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted debt the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our debt could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments, including the indenture governing our outstanding debt securities. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to repay borrowings fully under all of our outstanding debt instruments if any of our debt instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In such an event, we may be unable to repay our debt obligations. In addition, in some instances, this would create an event of default under the indenture governing our outstanding debt securities.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and meet our other ongoing liquidity needs and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may be unsuccessful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations and to fund our planned capital expenditures and other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that borrowings will be available to us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We may be unable to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIn addition, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which will not be guarantors of our indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding debt securities limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the indenture governing our outstanding debt securities may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility would be at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. Assuming all revolving loans were fully drawn, each one percentage point change in interest rates would result in a $1.0 million change in annual cash interest expense on our credit facility.\nOur Senior Notes and the guarantees thereof will be effectively subordinated to any of our and our guarantors' secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness.\nThe Senior Notes and the guarantees thereof are not secured by any of our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries. The indenture governing the Senior Notes permits us to incur secured debt up to specified limits. As a result, the Senior Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to our and our guarantors' future secured indebtedness with respect to the collateral that secures such indebtedness, including any borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Upon a default in payment on, or the acceleration of, any of our secured indebtedness, or in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or other insolvency proceeding involving us or such guarantor, the proceeds from the sale of collateral securing any secured indebtedness will be available to pay obligations on the Senior Notes only after such secured indebtedness has been paid in full. As a result, the holders of the Senior Notes may receive less, ratably, than the holders of secured debt in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or other insolvency proceeding involving us or such guarantor.\nOur current credit facility allows us to draw up to $100 million on a revolving basis, all of which would be secured debt.\nOur Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nThe Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Notes, which include all of our non-domestic subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries. These non-guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to the notes, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or other payments. Any right that we or the guarantors have to receive any assets of any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of those subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of holders of Senior Notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of those subsidiaries' assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of those subsidiaries' creditors, including trade creditors and holders of preferred equity interests of those subsidiaries. Accordingly, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, these non-guarantor subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debts, holders of preferred equity interests and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us or any guarantor. Unless they are guarantors of the Senior Notes or our other indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Senior Notes or our other indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented 33% of our sales of metals and 32% of our other operating expenses. As of December 31, 2014, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented 36% of our total assets and 22% of our total liabilities, including trade payables, deferred tax liabilities and royalty obligations but excluding intercompany liabilities.\nKey terms of the Senior Notes will be suspended if the Senior Notes achieve investment grade ratings and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.\nMany of the covenants in the indenture governing the Senior Notes will be suspended if the Senior Notes are rated investment grade by Standard & Poor's and Moody's provided at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, including those covenants that restrict, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, incur debt and to enter into certain other transactions. There can be no assurance that the Senior Notes will ever be rated investment grade. However, suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force, and the effects of any such transactions will be permitted to remain in place even if the Senior Notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade.\nWe may be unable to repurchase Senior Notes and any outstanding loans under our revolving credit facility could be accelerated in the event of a change of control as required by the indenture.\nUpon the occurrence of certain kinds of change of control events specified in the indenture governing the Senior Notes, holders of the Senior Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all of the Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. Any change of control also would constitute a default under our revolving credit facility. Therefore, upon the occurrence of a change of control, the lenders under our revolving credit facility would have the right to accelerate any outstanding loans and, if so accelerated, we would be required to repay all of our outstanding obligations under such facility. We may not be able to pay the Senior Note holders the required price for their notes at that time because we may not have available funds to pay the repurchase price. In addition, the terms of other existing or future debt may prevent us from paying the Senior Note holders. There can be no assurance that we would be able to repay such other debt or obtain consents from the holders of such other debt to repurchase the Senior Notes. Any requirement to offer to purchase any Senior Notes may result in us having to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, which we may not be able to do. In addition, even if we were able to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, such financing may be on terms unfavorable to us.\nHolders of the Senior Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the Senior Notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of \"substantially all\" of our assets.\nThe definition of change of control in the indenture governing the Senior Notes includes a phrase relating to the sale of \"all or substantially all\" of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase \"substantially all\" under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Senior Notes to require us to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain.\nFederal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the Senior Notes or any of the guarantees thereof, and if that occurs, holders of the Senior Notes may not receive any payments.\nFederal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the Senior Notes and the incurrence of any guarantees of the Senior Notes. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the Senior Notes or any guarantees thereof could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if we or any existing or future subsidiary guarantors, as applicable, (a) issued the Senior Notes or incurred such guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (b) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the Senior Notes or incurring the guarantee and, in the case of (b) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof:\n\u2022\nwe or the subsidiary guarantor, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Senior Notes or the incurrence of the guarantee;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of the Senior Notes or the incurrence of the guarantee left us or the subsidiary guarantor, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the business; or\n\u2022\nwe or the subsidiary guarantor intended to, or believed that we or such subsidiary guarantor would, incur debts beyond our or such subsidiary guarantor's ability to pay as they mature.\nAs a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that any subsidiary guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee to the extent such subsidiary guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit from the issuance of the Senior Notes.\nWe cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or any subsidiary guarantor was insolvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, whether the Senior Notes or any guarantees would be subordinated to our or any subsidiary guarantor's other debt. In general, however, a court would deem an entity insolvent if:\n\u2022\nthe sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets;\n\u2022\nthe present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or\n\u2022\nit could not pay its debts as they became due.\nThe subsidiary guarantees contain a \"savings clause\" intended to limit the subsidiary guarantor's liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect any subsidiary guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law. Furthermore, in Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of TOUSA, Inc. v Citicorp North America, Inc., the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Florida held that a savings clause similar to the savings clause used in the indenture was unenforceable. As a result, the subsidiary guarantees were found to be fraudulent conveyances. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit recently affirmed the liability findings of the Bankruptcy Court without ruling directly on the enforceability of savings clauses generally. If the TOUSA decision were followed by other courts, the risk that the guarantees would be deemed fraudulent conveyances would be significantly increased.\nTo the extent that any subsidiary guarantee is avoided, then, as to that subsidiary, the guaranty would not be enforceable.\nIf a court were to find that the issuance of the Senior Notes or the incurrence of any guarantee was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the Senior Notes or such guarantee, could subordinate the Senior Notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or of the related subsidiary guarantor or could require the holders of the Senior Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, holders of the Senior Notes may not receive any repayment. Further, the avoidance of the Senior Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries' other debt that could result in acceleration of that debt.\nFinally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Senior Notes to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (1) the holders of the Senior Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (2) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Senior Notes and (3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nOur credit ratings may not reflect all risks associated with an investment in our Senior Notes.\nCredit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our results of operations, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading, or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely increase our cost of financing, limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, including our Senior Notes.\nOperation, Development, Exploration and Acquisition Risks\nMining accidents or other adverse events at an operation could decrease our anticipated production.\nProduction may be reduced below our historical or estimated levels as a result of mining accidents; unfavorable ground or shaft conditions; work stoppages or slow-downs; lower than expected ore grades; unexpected regulatory actions; if the metallurgical characteristics of ore are less economic than anticipated; or because our equipment or facilities fail to operate properly or as expected. Both of the Lucky Friday and Casa Berardi mines have a history of ground instability and related incidents. All of our mines are subject to risks relating to ground instability, including, but not limited to, crown pillar collapse or stope failure. The occurrence of an event such as those described above could result in loss of life or temporary or permanent cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Other closures or impacts on operations or production may occur at any of our mines at any time, whether related to accidents, changes in conditions, changes to regulatory policy, or as precautionary measures.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by risks and hazards associated with the mining industry that may not be fully covered by insurance.\nOur business is capital intensive, requiring ongoing investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. Our mining and milling operations are subject to risks of process upsets and equipment malfunctions. Equipment and supplies may from time to time be unavailable on a timely basis. Our business is subject to a number of other risks and hazards including:\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards;\n\u2022\nunusual or unexpected geologic formations;\n\u2022\nrock bursts and ground falls;\n\u2022\nseismic activity;\n\u2022\nunderground fires or floods;\n\u2022\nunanticipated hydrologic conditions, including flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical and country risks;\n\u2022\ncivil unrest or terrorism;\n\u2022\nindustrial accidents;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes or strikes; and\n\u2022\nour operating mines have tailing ponds which could fail or leak as a result of seismic activity, unusual weather or for other reasons.\nSuch risks could result in:\n\u2022\npersonal injury or fatalities;\n\u2022\ndamage to or destruction of mineral properties or producing facilities;\n\u2022\nenvironmental damage and financial penalties;\n\u2022\ndelays in exploration, development or mining;\n\u2022\nmonetary losses;\n\u2022\nlegal liability; and\n\u2022\ntemporary or permanent closure of facilities.\nWe maintain insurance to protect against losses that may result from some of these risks, such as property loss and business interruption, in amounts we believe to be reasonably consistent with our historical experience, industry practice and circumstances surrounding each identified risk. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to environmental liability and political risk. We have received some payment for business interruption insurance claims related to the temporary suspension of operations at the Lucky Friday mine and continue to seek further reimbursement (see the risk factor above titled \"Mining accidents or other adverse events at an operation could decrease our anticipated production\"). There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. Insurance specific to environmental risks is generally either unavailable or, we believe, too expensive for us, and we therefore do not maintain environmental insurance. Occurrence of events for which we are not insured may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur development of new orebodies and other capital costs may be higher and provide less return than we estimated.\nCapitalized development projects may cost more and provide less return than we estimate. If we are unable to realize a return on these investments, we may incur a related asset write-down that could adversely affect our financial results or condition.\nOur ability to sustain or increase our current level of metals production partly depends on our ability to develop new orebodies and/or expand existing mining operations. Before we can begin a development project, we must first determine whether it is economically feasible to do so. This determination is based on estimates of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nore reserves;\n\u2022\nexpected recovery rates of metals from the ore;\n\u2022\nfuture metals prices;\n\u2022\nfacility and equipment costs;\n\u2022\navailability of adequate staffing;\n\u2022\navailability of affordable sources of power and adequacy of water supply;\n\u2022\nexploration and drilling success;\n\u2022\ncapital and operating costs of a development project;\n\u2022\nenvironmental considerations and permitting;\n\u2022\nadequate access to the site, including competing land uses (such as agriculture);\n\u2022\napplicable tax rates;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuation and inflation rates; and\n\u2022\navailability of financing.\nMany of these estimates are based on geological and other interpretive data, which may be imprecise. As a result, actual operating and capital costs and returns from a development project may differ substantially from our estimates, and, as such, it may not be economically feasible to continue with a development project.\nOur ore reserve estimates may be imprecise.\nOur ore reserve figures and costs are primarily estimates and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of these metals. You are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on estimates of reserves (or mineralized material or other resource estimates). Reserves are estimates made by our professional technical personnel, and no assurance can be given that the estimated amount of metal or the indicated level of recovery of these metals will be realized. Reserve estimation is an interpretive process based upon available data and various assumptions. Our reserve estimates may change based on actual production experience. Further, reserves are valued based on estimates of costs and metals prices, which may not be consistent among our properties or across the industry. The economic value of ore reserves may be adversely affected by:\n\u2022\ndeclines in the market price of the various metals we mine;\n\u2022\nincreased production or capital costs;\n\u2022\nreduction in the grade or tonnage of the deposit;\n\u2022\nincrease in the dilution of the ore;\n\u2022\nreduced metal recovery; and\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements.\nShort-term operating factors relating to our ore reserves, such as the need to sequentially develop orebodies and the processing of new or different ore grades, may adversely affect our cash flow. If the prices of metals that we produce decline substantially below the levels used to calculate reserves for an extended period, we could experience:\n\u2022\ndelays in new project development;\n\u2022\nnet losses;\n\u2022\nreduced cash flow;\n\u2022\nreductions in reserves;\n\u2022\nwrite-downs of asset values; and\n\u2022\nmine closure.\nEfforts to expand the finite lives of our mines may not be successful or could result in significant demands on our liquidity, which could hinder our growth and decrease the value of our stock.\nOne of the risks we face is that mines are depleting assets. Thus, we must continually replace depleted ore reserves by locating and developing additional ore. Our ability to expand or replace ore reserves primarily depends on the success of our exploration programs. Mineral exploration, particularly for silver and gold, is highly speculative and expensive. It involves many risks and is often non-productive. Even if we believe we have found a valuable mineral deposit, it may be several years before production from that deposit is possible. During that time, it may become no longer feasible to produce those minerals for economic, regulatory, political or other reasons. As a result of high costs and other uncertainties, we may not be able to expand or replace our existing ore reserves as they are depleted, which would adversely affect our business and financial position in the future.\nThe #4 Shaft project, an internal shaft at the Lucky Friday mine, is expected, upon its completion, to provide deeper access in order to increase the mine's production and operational life. The #4 Shaft project, as currently designed, is expected to involve development down to the 8800 foot level and capital expenditures of approximately $215 million, which includes approximately $165 million that has been spent on the project as of December 31, 2014. We believe that our current capital resources will allow us to complete the project by its estimated completion target of 2016. However, there are a number of factors that could affect completion of the project as currently designed, including: (i) a significant decline in metals prices, (ii) a reduction in available cash or credit, whether arising from decreased cash flow or other uses of available cash, (iii) increased regulatory compliance, or (iv) a significant increase in operating or capital costs. One or more of these factors could potentially require us to suspend the project, defer or eliminate some of the planned development, or access additional capital through debt financing, the sale of securities, or other external sources. This additional financing could be costly or unavailable.\nOur joint development and operating arrangements may not be successful.\nWe have entered into joint venture arrangements in order to share the risks and costs of developing and operating properties. In a typical joint venture arrangement, the partners own proportionate shares of the assets, are entitled to indemnification from each other and are only responsible for any future liabilities in proportion to their interest in the joint venture. If a party fails to perform its obligations under a joint venture agreement, we could incur liabilities and losses in excess of our pro-rata share of the joint venture. We make investments in exploration and development projects that may have to be written off in the event we do not proceed to a commercially viable mining operation. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur ability to market our metals production may be affected by disruptions or closures of custom smelters and/or refining facilities.\nWe sell our metallic concentrates to custom smelters and brokers. Our dor\u00e9 bars are sent to refiners for further processing before being sold to metal traders. If we are unable to sell concentrates to our customers, our operations could be adversely affected. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the distribution of our sales and our significant customers.\nWe face inherent risks in acquisitions of other mining companies or properties that may adversely impact our growth strategy.\nWe are actively seeking to expand our mineral reserves by acquiring other mining companies or properties. For example, on June 1, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Aurizon Mines Ltd., giving us 100% ownership of the Casa Berardi mine and other mineral interests. Although we are pursuing opportunities that we feel are in the best interest of our stockholders, these pursuits are costly and often unproductive. Inherent risks in acquisitions we may undertake in the future could adversely affect our current business and financial condition and our growth.\nThere is a limited supply of desirable mineral properties available in the United States and foreign countries where we would consider conducting exploration and/or production activities, and any acquisition we may undertake is subject to inherent risks. In addition to the risk associated with limited mine lives, we may not realize the value of the companies or properties that are acquired due to a possible decline in metals prices, failure to obtain permits, labor problems, changes in regulatory environment, failure to achieve anticipated synergies, an inability to obtain financing, and other factors previously described. Acquisitions of other mining companies or properties may also expose us to new geographic, political, operating, and geological risks. In addition, we face strong competition for companies and properties from other mining companies, some of which have greater financial resources than we do, and we may be unable to acquire attractive companies and mining properties on terms that we consider acceptable.\nOur business depends on finding skilled miners and maintaining good relations with our employees.\nWe are dependent upon the ability and experience of our executive officers, managers, employees and other personnel, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain such employees. We compete with other companies both in and outside the mining industry in recruiting and retaining qualified employees knowledgeable about the mining business. From time to time, we have encountered, and may in the future encounter, difficulty recruiting skilled mining personnel at acceptable wage and benefit levels in a competitive labor market, and may be required to utilize contractors, which can be more costly. Temporary or extended lay-offs due to mine closures may exacerbate such issues and result in vacancies or the need to hire less skilled or efficient employees. The loss of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations. The Lucky Friday mine is our only operation subject to a collective bargaining agreement, which expires on April 30, 2016.\nIn March 2012, Hecla Limited received notice of a complaint filed against it by the United Steel Workers, Local 5114, with the U.S. Mine Safety Health Review Commission for compensation for bargaining unit workers at the Lucky Friday mine who were idled as a result of the temporary suspension of production at the mine (see the Other Contingencies section of Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).\nCompetition from other mining companies may harm our business.\nWe compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, and other employees. We also compete with other mining companies for the services of other skilled personnel and contractors and their specialized equipment, components and supplies, such as drill rigs, necessary for exploration and development. We also compete with other mining companies for rights to mine properties. We may be unable to continue to obtain the services of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or supplies, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties.\nWe may be subject to a number of unanticipated risks related to inadequate infrastructure.\nMining, processing, development and exploration activities depend on adequate infrastructure. Reliable roads, bridges, power sources and water supply are important to our operations, and their availability and condition affect capital and operating costs. Unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, sabotage, other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure, or government intervention, could adversely affect our mining operations.\nOur foreign activities are subject to additional inherent risks.\nOn June 1, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Aurizon, giving us 100% ownership of the producing Casa Berardi mine, along with interests in various other properties, in Quebec, Canada. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In addition, we currently conduct exploration and pre-development activities in Mexico and continue to own assets, including real estate and mineral interests there. We anticipate that we will continue to conduct operations in Canada, Mexico, and possibly other international locations in the future. Because we conduct operations internationally, we are subject to political and economic risks such as:\n\u2022\nthe effects of local political, labor and economic developments and unrest;\n\u2022\nsignificant or abrupt changes in the applicable regulatory or legal climate;\n\u2022\nexchange controls and export restrictions;\n\u2022\nexpropriation or nationalization of assets with inadequate compensation;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, particularly in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nrepatriation restrictions;\n\u2022\ninvalidation and unavailability of governmental orders, permits or agreements;\n\u2022\nproperty ownership disputes;\n\u2022\nrenegotiation or nullification of existing concessions, licenses, permits and contracts;\n\u2022\ncriminal activity, corruption, demands for improper payments, expropriation, and uncertain legal enforcement and physical security;\n\u2022\ndisadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nfuel or other commodity shortages;\n\u2022\nillegal mining;\n\u2022\nlaws or policies of foreign countries and the United States affecting trade, investment and taxation;\n\u2022\ncivil disturbances, war and terrorist actions; and\n\u2022\nseizures of assets.\nConsequently, our exploration, development and production activities outside of the United States may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Fluctuations in exchange rates may impact our earnings, the value of assets held abroad and our operating and capital costs in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of the properties we acquire, including the Aurizon properties.\nIntegration of the operations of the properties we acquire with our existing business will be a complex, time-consuming and costly process. Failure to successfully integrate the acquired properties and operations in a timely manner may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The difficulties of combining the acquired operations include, among other things:\n\u2022\noperating a larger organization;\n\u2022\noperating in multiple legal jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically and linguistically disparate organizations, systems and facilities;\n\u2022\nadapting to additional political, regulatory, legal and social requirements;\n\u2022\nintegrating corporate, technological and administrative functions; and\n\u2022\ndiverting management's attention from other business concerns.\nThe process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of, or a slowdown in, the activities of our business. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from any future acquisitions, such as increased earnings, cost savings and revenue enhancements, for various reasons, including difficulties integrating operations and personnel, higher than expected acquisition and operating costs or other difficulties, unknown liabilities, inaccurate reserve estimates and fluctuations in market prices.\nThe properties we may acquire may not produce as expected, and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the acquired properties or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities.\nThe properties we acquire in any acquisitions may not produce as expected, may be in an unexpected condition and we may be subject to increased costs and liabilities, including environmental liabilities. Although we review properties prior to acquisition in a manner consistent with industry practices, such reviews are not capable of identifying all potential adverse conditions. Generally, it is not feasible to review in depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems or permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their condition, any deficiencies, and development potential.\nThe acquisition of Aurizon exposes us to additional political risks.\nOur properties obtained through the acquisition of Aurizon are located in areas of Quebec, Canada which may be of particular interest or sensitivity to one or more interest groups, including aboriginal groups (which are generally referred to as \"First Nations\"). We now have mineral projects in Quebec that may be in areas with a First Nations presence. It is our practice to work closely with and consult with First Nations in areas in which our projects are located or which could be impacted by our activities. However, there is no assurance that relationships with such groups will be positive. Accordingly, it is possible that our production, exploration or development activities on these properties could be interrupted or otherwise adversely affected in the future by political uncertainty, native land claims entitlements, expropriations of property, changes in applicable law, governmental policies and policies of relevant interest groups, including those of First Nations. Any changes in law or relations or shifts in political conditions may be beyond our control and may adversely affect our business and operations and if significant, may result in the impairment or loss of mineral concessions or other mineral rights, or may make it impossible to continue our mineral production, exploration or development activities in the applicable area, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of operations.\nLegal, Regulatory and Market Risks\nWe are currently involved in ongoing legal disputes that may materially adversely affect us.\nThere are several ongoing legal disputes in which we are involved, and additional actions may be filed against us. We may be subject to future claims, including those relating to environmental damage, safety conditions at our mines, and other matters. The outcomes of these pending and potential claims are uncertain. We may not resolve these claims favorably. Depending on the outcome, these actions could have adverse financial effects or cause reputational harm to us. If any of these disputes result in a substantial monetary judgment against us, are settled on terms in excess of our current accruals, or otherwise impact our operations, our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected. For a description of some of the lawsuits and other claims in which we are involved, see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe are required to obtain governmental permits and other approvals in order to conduct mining operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, mining companies are required to seek governmental permits and other approvals for continuation or expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new operations. For example, we estimate that our Greens Creek tailings impoundment area has sufficient capacity to meet our needs through the end of 2016. In order to increase the tailings capacity at the mine, certain permits are required. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex, time-consuming and costly process. The duration and success of our efforts to obtain permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control. Obtaining environmental permits, including the approval of reclamation plans, may increase costs and cause delays or halt the continuation of mining operations depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted and the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority. Interested parties may seek to prevent issuance of permits and intervene in the process or pursue extensive appeal rights. Past or ongoing violations of laws or regulations could provide a basis to revoke existing permits or to deny the issuance of additional permits. In addition, evolving reclamation or environmental concerns may threaten our ability to renew existing permits or obtain new permits in connection with future development, expansions and operations. There can be no assurance that all necessary approvals and permits will be obtained and, if obtained, that the costs involved will not exceed those that we previously estimated. It is possible that the costs and delays associated with the compliance with such standards and regulations could become such that we would not proceed with the development or operation. We are often required to post surety bonds or cash collateral to secure our reclamation obligations and we may be unable to obtain the required surety bonds or may not have the resources to provide cash collateral.\nWe face substantial governmental regulation and environmental risk.\nOur business is subject to extensive U.S. and foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing development, production, labor standards, health and safety, the environment and other matters. For example, our operating mines in the United States frequently receive citations under the Mine Safety and Health Act, as administered by MSHA. Further, we have been and are currently involved in lawsuits or disputes in which we have been accused of causing environmental damage, violating environmental laws, or violating environmental permits, and we may be subject to similar lawsuits or disputes in the future. See the risk factor below titled \"Our environmental obligations may exceed the provisions we have made.\"\nExposure to these liabilities arises not only from our existing operations, but also from operations that have been closed, sold to third parties, or properties in which we had a leasehold, joint venture, or other interest. With a history dating back to 1891, our exposure to environmental claims may be greater because of the bankruptcy or dissolution of other mining companies which may have engaged in more significant activities at a mining site than we but which are no longer available for governmental agencies or other claimants to make claims against or obtain judgments from. Similarly, the federal government or private parties could seek to hold Hecla Limited or Hecla Mining Company liable for the actions of certain subsidiaries under \"alter ego\" or similar theories which seek to disregard the separateness of corporate entities within our consolidated corporate group.\nWe are required to reclaim properties and specific requirements vary among jurisdictions. In some cases, we may be required to provide financial assurances as security for reclamation costs, which may exceed our estimates for such costs. Our historical operations and the historical operations of entities and properties we have acquired have occasionally been alleged to have generated environmental contamination. We could also be held liable for worker exposure to hazardous substances. There can be no assurance that we will at all times be in compliance with all environmental, health and safety regulations or that steps to achieve compliance would not materially adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to existing regulatory requirements, legislation and regulations may be adopted or permit limits reduced at any time that result in additional exposure to liability, operating expense, capital expenditures or restrictions and delays in the mining, production or development of our properties. Mining accidents and fatalities, whether or not at our mines or related to metals mining, may increase the likelihood of additional regulation or changes in law. In addition, enforcement or regulatory tools and methods available to governmental regulators such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which have not been or have seldomly been used against us, could be used against us. Federal or state environmental or mine safety regulatory agencies may order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed, which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.\nLegislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and green house gas emissions are in various phases of consideration. If adopted, such measures could increase our cost of environmental compliance and also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities. Proposed measures could also result in increased cost of fuel and other consumables used at our operations, including the diesel generation of electricity at our Greens Creek operation, if we are unable to regularly access hydroelectric power. Climate change legislation may also affect our smelter customers who burn fossil fuels, resulting in increased costs to us, and may affect the market for the metals we produce with effects on prices that are not possible for us to predict.\nFrom time to time, the U.S. Congress considers proposed amendments to the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended (the \u201cGeneral Mining Law\u201d), which governs mining claims and related activities on federal lands. The extent of any future changes is not known and the potential impact on us as a result of U.S. Congressional action is difficult to predict. Changes to the General Mining Law, if adopted, could adversely affect our ability to economically develop mineral reserves on federal lands. Although we are not currently mining on federal land, we do explore, and future mining could occur, on federal land.\nThe Clean Water Act requires permits for operations that discharge into waters of the United States. Such permitting has been a frequent subject of litigation by environmental advocacy groups, which has resulted, and may in the future result, in declines in such permits or extensive delays in receiving them. This may result in delays in, or in some instances preclude, the commencement or continuation of development or production operations. Adverse outcomes in lawsuits challenging permits or failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the suspension, denial, or revocation of required permits, which could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur environmental obligations may exceed the provisions we have made.\nWe are subject to significant environmental obligations. At December 31, 2014, we had accrued $57.3 million as a provision for environmental obligations. For information on our potential environmental liabilities, see Note 4 and Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe face transportation risks relating to our products, as well as employees and materials at Greens Creek.\nCertain of the products we ship to our customers are subject to regulatory requirements regarding packaging, handling and shipping of products that may be considered dangerous to human health or the environment. Although we believe we are currently in compliance with all material regulations applicable to packaging, handling and shipping our products, the chemical properties of our products or existing regulations could change and cause us to fall out of compliance, or force us to incur substantial additional expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable regulations. Further, we do not ship our own products but instead rely on third party carriers to ship our products to our customers. To the extent that any of our carriers are unable or unwilling to ship our products in accordance with applicable regulations, including because of difficulty in obtaining, or increased cost of, insurance, we could be forced to find alternative shipping arrangements, assuming such alternatives would be available. Any such changes to our current shipping arrangements could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.\nIn addition, Greens Creek operates on an island and is substantially dependent on various forms of marine transportation for the transportation of employees and materials to the mine and for the export of its products from the mine. Any disruption to these forms of marine transportation would adversely impact mine operations, and possible effects could include suspension of operations.\nThe titles to some of our properties may be defective or challenged.\nUnpatented mining claims constitute a significant portion of our undeveloped property holdings, the validity of which could be uncertain and may be contested. Although we have conducted title reviews of our property holdings, title review does not necessarily preclude third parties from challenging our title. In accordance with mining industry practice, we do not generally obtain title opinions until we decide to develop a property. Therefore, while we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to our undeveloped properties, some titles may be defective.\nThe price of our stock has a history of volatility and could decline in the future.\nShares of our common and outstanding preferred stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The market price for our stock has been volatile, often based on:\n\u2022\nchanges in metals prices, particularly silver and gold;\n\u2022\nour results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our public news releases or periodic filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nfluctuating proven and probable reserves;\n\u2022\nfactors unrelated to our financial performance or future prospects, such as global economic developments, market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries, or the reliability of metals markets;\n\u2022\npolitical and regulatory risk;\n\u2022\nthe success of our exploration, pre-development, and capital programs;\n\u2022\nability to meet production estimates;\n\u2022\nenvironmental, safety and legal risk;\n\u2022\nthe extent and nature of analytical coverage concerning our business; and\n\u2022\nthe trading volume and general market interest in our securities.\nThe market price of our stock at any given point in time may not accurately reflect our value, and may prevent stockholders from realizing a profit on their investment.\nOur Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $50 per share or $7.9 million.\nIf we were liquidated, holders of our preferred stock would be entitled to receive approximately $7.9 million (plus any accrued and unpaid dividends) from any liquidation proceeds before holders of our common stock would be entitled to receive any proceeds, but after holders of all notes issued under the indenture governing our outstanding debt securities received any proceeds.\nWe may not be able to pay common or preferred stock dividends in the future.\nSince January 2010, we have paid all regular quarterly dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock. The annual dividend payable on the Series B Preferred Stock is currently $0.6 million. Prior to 2010, there were numerous occasions when we did not declare dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, but instead deferred them. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay preferred stock dividends in the future.\nOur Board of Directors adopted a common stock dividend policy that has two components: (1) a dividend that links the amount of dividends on our common stock to our average quarterly realized silver price in the preceding quarter, and (2) a minimum annual dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock, in each case payable quarterly, when declared. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on potential dividend amounts under the first component of the policy at various silver prices.\nFrom the fourth quarter of 2011 through and including the fourth quarter of 2014, our Board of Directors has declared a common stock dividend under the policy described above (although in some cases only a minimum dividend was declared and none relating to the average realized price of silver due to the prices not meeting the policy threshold). The declaration and payment of common stock dividends, whether pursuant to the policy or in addition thereto, is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare and pay common stock dividends in the future. In addition, the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes limits our ability to pay dividends.\nOur existing stockholders are effectively subordinated to the holders of our senior notes.\nIn the event of our liquidation or dissolution, stockholders' entitlement to share ratably in any distribution of our assets would be subordinated to the holders of our senior notes. Any rights that a stockholder may have in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation or a reorganization of us or any of our subsidiaries, and any consequent rights of stockholders to realize on the proceeds from the sale of any of our or our subsidiaries' assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of the holders of our senior notes.\nAdditional issuances of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could reduce our earnings per share.\nWe may issue securities in the future in connection with acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes. To the extent we issue any additional equity securities (or securities convertible into equity), the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted and our earnings per share could be reduced.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our preferred or common stock in the future could adversely affect holders of common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by any preferred or common stock we may issue. Our board of directors is authorized to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. This includes the power to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the business and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected.\nIf a large number of shares of our common stock are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, future issuances by us of our common stock or other equity will have on the market price of our common stock. Any shares that we may issue may not have any resale restrictions, and therefore could be immediately sold by the holders. The market price of our common stock could decline if certain large holders of our common stock, or recipients of our common stock, sell all or a significant portion of their shares of common stock or are perceived by the market as intending to sell these shares other than in an orderly manner. In addition, these sales could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common stock in the capital markets.\nThe provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware law could delay or deter tender offers or takeover attempts.\nCertain provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if that transaction could be beneficial to stockholders. These impediments include:\n\u2022\nthe classification of our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, which makes it more difficult to quickly replace board members;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\na provision that special meetings of our board of directors may be called only by our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\na provision that special meetings of stockholders may only be called pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition against action by written consent of our stockholders;\n\u2022\na provision that our board members may only be removed for cause and by an affirmative vote of at least 80% of the outstanding voting stock;\n\u2022\na provision that our stockholders comply with advance-notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022\na prohibition against certain business combinations with an acquirer of 15% or more of our common stock for three years after such acquisition unless the stock acquisition or the business combination is approved by our board prior to the acquisition of the 15% interest, or after such acquisition our board and the holders of two-thirds of the other common stock approve the business combination; and\n\u2022\na prohibition against our entering into certain business combinations with interested stockholders without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of voting stock.\nIf we cannot meet the New York Stock Exchange continued listing requirements, the NYSE may delist our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. In the future, if we are not be able to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE, which require, among other things, that the average closing price of our common stock be above $1.00 over 30 consecutive trading days, our common stock may be delisted. Our closing stock price on February 16, 2015, was $3.42.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the NYSE criteria for continued listing, our common stock would be subject to delisting. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage of us; and limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. In addition, delisting from the NYSE might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our business.", "PERMNO": 32651, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "HL"}
