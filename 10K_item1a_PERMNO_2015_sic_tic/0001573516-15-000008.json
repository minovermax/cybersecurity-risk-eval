{"cik": "1573516", "company": "Murphy USA Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to our Company\nWe have limited history operating as an independent public company. We incurred significant costs to create the corporate infrastructure necessary to operate as an independent public company, and we may experience increased ongoing costs in connection with being an independent public company compared to our history prior to the Separation.\nWe have historically used Murphy Oil\u2019s corporate infrastructure to support our business functions, including information technology systems. The expenses related to establishing and maintaining this infrastructure were spread among all of Murphy Oil\u2019s businesses. Following the Separation, we no longer have access to Murphy Oil\u2019s infrastructure, and we have established and continue to maintain our own. While the majority of these costs were incurred by Murphy Oil prior to the Separation, we have incurred costs since the Separation and expect to continue to incur such costs to enhance and maintain the remaining necessary infrastructure.\nPrior to the Separation, Murphy Oil performed many important corporate functions for us, including some treasury and payroll, tax administration and compliance, human resources, compensation and benefits, legal and other services. Following the Separation, Murphy Oil has continued to provide some of these services to us on a transitional basis, generally for a period of up to 18 months, with a possible extension of 6 months, pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. Murphy Oil may not successfully execute all these functions during the transition period or we may have to expend significant efforts or costs materially in excess of those estimated under the Transition Services Agreement. Any interruption in these services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. In addition, no later than the end of this transition period, we will need to perform these functions ourselves or hire third parties to perform these functions on our behalf. The costs associated with performing or outsourcing these functions may exceed the amounts reflected in our historical consolidated and combined financial statements or that we have agreed to pay Murphy Oil during the transition period. A significant increase in the costs of performing or outsourcing these functions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSince August 30, 2013, we have been subject to reporting and other obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), and we have complied with the applicable requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for the year ended December 31, 2014. This requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing the effectiveness of these controls. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management and our administrative and operational resources, including accounting resources.\nIn connection with our Separation from Murphy Oil, Murphy Oil has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify Murphy Oil for certain liabilities. If we are required to act under these indemnities to Murphy Oil, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted. The Murphy Oil indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it will be allocated responsibility, and Murphy Oil may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements with Murphy Oil, Murphy Oil has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we have agreed to indemnify Murphy\nOil for certain liabilities. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Murphy Oil are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the distribution. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Murphy Oil has agreed to retain, and under certain circumstances, we may be subject to continuing contingent liabilities of Murphy Oil following the Separation. Further, Murphy Oil may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Murphy Oil any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations present hazards and risks, which may not be fully covered by insurance, if insured. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe scope and nature of our operations present a variety of operational hazards and risks, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, and natural catastrophes that must be managed through continual oversight and control. These and other risks are present throughout our operations. As protection against these hazards and risks, we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from such risks. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating risks could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have debt obligations that could restrict our business and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; our leverage could increase the overall cost of debt funding and decrease the overall debt capacity and commercial credit available to us in the future.\nIn connection with the Separation, we borrowed $650 million of new debt, used in part to fund a cash dividend to Murphy Oil immediately prior to the Separation. We have already repaid $150 million of this debt which was represented by a term loan. The remaining level of debt could have significant consequences to our future operations, including:\n\u00b7\nmaking it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt;\n\u00b7\nresulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u00b7\nreducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our credit facilities and the indenture that governs the notes include restrictive covenants that, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, restrict or limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, make certain investments, sell certain assets and enter into certain strategic transactions, including mergers and acquisitions. These covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business, and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nOur leverage may increase the overall cost of debt funding and decrease the overall debt capacity and commercial credit available to us. We have below investment-grade ratings from Moody\u2019s and S&P based on our current capital structure. Our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a ratings agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. If our existing ratings are lowered, or otherwise we do not obtain an investment grade rating in the future, or if we do and a rating agency were to downgrade us again to below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nIf the distribution from Murphy Oil, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, shareholders and Murphy Oil could be subject to significant tax liability and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify Murphy Oil for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement entered into in connection with the Separation.\nMurphy Oil has received a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that, among other things, the distribution, together with certain related transactions, will qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free to Murphy Oil and its stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and has also received a tax opinion from Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, counsel to Murphy Oil, to substantially the same effect. The private letter ruling and the tax opinion does rely on certain representations, assumptions and undertakings, including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business, and neither the private letter ruling nor the opinion would be valid if such representations, assumptions and undertakings were incorrect. Moreover, the private letter ruling does not address all the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution will qualify for tax-free treatment. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the tax opinion, the IRS could determine the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the IRS ruling.\nIf the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, in general, Murphy Oil would be subject to tax as if it had sold the Murphy USA common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and Murphy Oil stockholders who received shares of Murphy USA common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares. In connection with the distribution, we and Murphy Oil entered into a Tax Matters Agreement that governs our rights and obligations with respect to our respective tax liabilities. Generally, we and Murphy Oil will indemnify each other for taxes attributable to our respective operations, and we will indemnify Murphy Oil from the failure of the distribution to qualify as a distribution under Section 355 of the Code as a result of a breach of certain representations or covenants by us. If we are required to indemnify Murphy Oil under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.\nWe may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capital-raising transactions following the Separation. In addition, under some circumstances, we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capital-raising transactions.\nIn the absence of a supplemental private letter ruling from the IRS or an unqualified opinion from a nationally recognized tax advisor, for the two-year period following the distribution (which was completed on August 30, 2013), we would be prohibited from carrying out a number of transactions that may otherwise be desirable, including:\n\u00b7\nengaging in any transaction involving a merger, consolidation or other reorganization involving shares of our stock;\n\u00b7\nentering into transactions which would result in one or more persons acquiring stock representing a 40% or greater interest in us;\n\u00b7\ndisposing of assets used in the U.S. marketing business (other than our ethanol assets or other asset sales in the ordinary course of business);\n\u00b7\ndiscontinuing the U.S. marketing business or dissolving or liquidating; and\n\u00b7\nrepurchasing shares of our common stock, other than pursuant to open-market purchases to further legitimate business purposes.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nVolatility in the global prices of oil and petroleum products and general economic conditions that are largely out of our control, as well as seasonal variations in fuel pricing, can significantly affect our operating results.\nOur net income is significantly affected by changes in the margins on retail and wholesale gasoline marketing operations. Oil and domestic wholesale gasoline markets are volatile. General political conditions, acts of war or terrorism, instability in oil producing regions, particularly in the Middle East and South America, and the value of U.S. dollars relative to other foreign currencies, particularly those of oil producing nations, could significantly affect oil supplies and wholesale gasoline costs. In addition, the supply of gasoline and our wholesale purchase costs could be adversely affected in the event of a shortage, which could result from, among other things, lack of capacity at oil refineries, sustained increase in global demand or the fact that our gasoline contracts do not guarantee an uninterrupted, unlimited supply of gasoline. Our wholesale purchase costs could also be adversely affected by increasingly stringent regulations regarding the content and characteristics of fuel products. Significant increases and volatility in wholesale gasoline costs could result in lower gasoline gross margins per gallon. This volatility makes it extremely difficult to predict the effect that future wholesale cost fluctuations will have on our operating results and financial condition in future periods.\nExcept in limited cases, we typically do not seek to hedge any significant portion of our exposure to the effects of changing prices of crude oil and refined products. Dramatic increases in oil prices reduce retail gasoline gross margins, because wholesale gasoline costs typically increase faster than retailers are able to pass them along to customers. We purchase refined products, particularly gasoline, needed to supply our U.S. retail marketing stations. Therefore, our most significant costs are subject to volatility of prices for these commodities. Our ability to successfully manage operating costs is important because we have little or no influence on the sales prices or regional and worldwide consumer demand for oil and gasoline. Furthermore, oil prices, wholesale motor fuel costs, motor fuel sales volumes, motor fuel gross margins and merchandise sales can be subject to seasonal fluctuations. For example, consumer demand for motor fuel typically increases during the summer driving season, and typically falls during the winter months. Travel, recreation and construction are typically higher in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate, increasing the demand for motor fuel and merchandise that we sell. Therefore, our revenues and/or sales volumes are typically higher in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year. A significant change in any of these factors, including a significant decrease in consumer demand (other than typical seasonal variations), could materially affect our motor fuel and merchandise volumes, motor fuel gross profit and overall customer traffic, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, recessionary economic conditions, higher interest rates, higher gasoline and other energy costs, inflation, increases in commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws or other economic factors may affect consumer spending or buying habits, and could adversely affect the demand for products we sell at our retail sites. Unfavorable economic conditions, higher gasoline prices and unemployment levels can affect consumer confidence, spending patterns and miles driven. These factors can lead to sales declines in both gasoline and general merchandise, and in turn have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to continue to generate revenue and operating income depends on our continued relationship with Walmart.\nAt December 31, 2014, our 1,263 Company stations were almost all located near Walmart Supercenter stores. Therefore, our relationship with Walmart, the continued goodwill of Walmart and the integrity of Walmart\u2019s brand name in the retail marketplace are all important drivers for our business. Any\ndeterioration in our relationship with Walmart could have a material adverse effect on us, including limiting our future growth. In addition, our competitive posture could be weakened by negative changes at Walmart. Many of our Company stations benefit from customer traffic generated by Walmart retail stores, and if the customer traffic through these host stores decreases due to the economy or for any other reason, our sales could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, on December 21, 2012, we entered into an agreement with Walmart to purchase approximately 200 properties for the development of additional retail fueling stations, which we expect to complete over the next few years. As a result, the foregoing risks impact our ability to achieve growth from these additional retail sites. We also rely upon Walmart\u2019s cooperation with us in order to complete the purchases of these additional sites, and our agreement with Walmart requires us to obtain their approval of our development plans before we may purchase any properties from them. See \u201c - Walmart retains certain rights in its agreements with us, which may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business\u201d below. If our relationship with Walmart deteriorates or Walmart experiences a slowdown in customer traffic or reputational harm, we may not be successful in developing these additional retail sites, and as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe current level of additional incremental revenue that is generated from RINs may not be sustainable.\nOur revenues are impacted by our ability to generate revenues from activities such as blending bulk fuel with ethanol and bio-diesel to capture and subsequently sell Renewable Identification Numbers (\"RINs\"). The market price for RINs fluctuates based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to governmental and regulatory action and market dynamics. In recent years, we have benefited by our ability to attain RINs and sell them at favorable prices in the market; these prices have remained relatively steady in 2014 and into 2015 due to significant uncertainty about how government standards could be modified as they impact RINs. A significant decline in revenues from RINs in future periods could adversely affect our results of operations, and the impact could be material.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with the interruption of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party supply and transportation of refined products.\nWe utilize key product supply and wholesale assets, including our pipeline positions and product distribution terminals, to supply our retail fueling stations. Much of our competitive advantage arises out of these proprietary arrangements which, if disrupted, could materially and adversely affect us. In addition to our own operational risks discussed above, we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport petroleum or refined products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, governmental regulations or third-party actions. Furthermore, at some of our locations there are very few suppliers for fuel in that market.\nChanges in credit card expenses could reduce our gross margin, especially on gasoline.\nA significant portion of our retail sales involve payment using credit cards. We are assessed credit card fees as a percentage of transaction amounts and not as a fixed dollar amount or percentage of our gross margins. Higher gasoline prices result in higher credit card expenses, and an increase in credit card use or an increase in credit card fees would have a similar effect. Therefore, credit card fees charged on gasoline purchases that are more expensive as a result of higher gasoline prices are not necessarily accompanied by higher gross margins. In fact, such fees may cause lower gross margins. Lower gross margins on gasoline sales caused by higher credit card fees may decrease our overall gross margin and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWalmart retains certain rights in its agreements with us, which may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nIn recent years, we have purchased from Walmart the properties underlying over 900 of our Company stations. Our December 21, 2012 agreement with Walmart provides for the potential purchase of approximately 200 additional sites. Our agreement requires us to obtain Walmart\u2019s approval of our development plans and to indemnify Walmart for certain environmental liabilities. In addition, Walmart has the right to terminate the agreement with respect to certain properties located adjacent to Walmart stores if the sale of any such property to us would result in certain claims or liabilities against Walmart or, in Walmart\u2019s sole discretion, would impair the operation of the related Walmart store. To date, the agreement has been terminated with respect to some of the 200 sites due to various local conditions which would affect development including zoning and permitting restrictions. We continue to work with Walmart to determine if these terminated sites will be replaced with other sites at a future date. If we are unable to obtain Walmart\u2019s approval or Walmart terminates the agreement with respect to additional properties, or we are unable to obtain site development permits, we may develop fewer sites than we currently anticipate, and the development of these sites may take longer than we anticipate or may not occur at all. As a result, we can provide no assurance as to the number of sites contemplated by the agreement that we will develop. The failure to develop these sites as currently contemplated for any reason could materially impact our forecasted growth.\nIn addition, our owned properties that were purchased from Walmart are subject to Easements with Covenants and Restrictions Affecting Land (the \u201cECRs\u201d) between us and Walmart. The ECRs impose customary restrictions on the use of our properties, which Walmart has the right to enforce. The ECRs also provide that if we propose to sell a fueling station property or any portion thereof (other than in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of our properties that were purchased from Walmart or in connection with a bona fide financing), Walmart has a right of first refusal to purchase such property or portion thereof on similar terms. Subject to certain exceptions (including a merger in which we participate, the transfer of any of our securities or a change in control of us), if we market for sale to a third party all or substantially all of our properties that were purchased from Walmart, or if we receive an unsolicited offer to purchase such properties that we intend to accept, we are required to notify Walmart. Walmart then has the right, within 90 days of receipt of such notice, to make an offer to purchase such properties. If Walmart makes such an offer, for a period of one year we will generally only be permitted to accept third-party offers where the net consideration to us would be greater than that offered by Walmart.\nThe ECRs also prohibit us from transferring all or substantially all of our fueling station properties that were purchased from Walmart to a \u201ccompetitor\u201d of Walmart, as reasonably determined by Walmart. The term \u201ccompetitor\u201d is generally defined in the ECRs as an entity that owns, operates or controls grocery stores or supermarkets, wholesale club operations similar to that of a Sam\u2019s Club, discount department stores or other discount retailers similar to any of the various Walmart store prototypes or pharmacy or drug stores.\nSimilarly, some of our leased properties are subject to certain rights retained by Walmart. Our master lease agreement states that if Murphy Oil USA, Inc. is acquired or becomes party to any merger or consolidation that results in a material change in the management of the stations, Walmart will have the option to purchase the stations at fair market value. The master lease also prohibits us from selling all or any portion of a station without first offering to sell all or such portion to Walmart on the same terms and conditions. These provisions may restrict our ability to conduct our business on the terms and in the manner we consider most favorable and may adversely affect our future growth.\nWe currently have one principal supplier for over 85% of our merchandise. A disruption in supply could have a material effect on our business.\nOver 85% of our general merchandise, including most tobacco products and grocery items, is currently purchased from a single wholesale grocer, McLane Company, Inc. (\u201cMcLane\u201d). We have a contract with McLane through September 2015, but we may not be able to renew the contract when it expires, or on similar terms. Alternative suppliers that we could use may not be immediately available. A disruption in supply could have a material effect on our business, cost of goods sold, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to protect or maintain our rights in the trademarks we use in our business.\nWe expect to use the Murphy USA\u00ae and Murphy Express trademarks under the Trademark License Agreement that we entered into with Murphy Oil, which will continue to own those trademarks. Murphy Oil\u2019s actions and our actions to protect our rights in those trademarks may not be adequate to prevent others from using similar marks or otherwise violating our rights in those trademarks. Furthermore, our right to use those trademarks is limited to the marketing business and can be terminated by Murphy Oil upon the occurrence of certain events, such as our uncured material breach, insolvency or change of control.\nCapital financing may not always be available to fund our activities.\nWe usually must spend and risk a significant amount of capital to fund our activities. Although most capital needs are funded from operating cash flow, the timing of cash flows from operations and capital funding needs may not always coincide, and the levels of cash flow may not fully cover capital funding requirements.\nFrom time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. In connection with the Separation, we entered into a credit facility to provide us with available financing for working capital and other general corporate purposes. This credit facility is intended to meet any ongoing cash needs in excess of internally generated cash flows. Uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our credit facility. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our credit facility to satisfy our cash requirements, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.\nWe could be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain highly qualified senior personnel.\nWe are dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified senior personnel. If, for any reason, we are not able to attract and retain qualified senior personnel, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, which could adversely affect us in many ways, including our profitability, our ability to grow, and our ability to manage our businesses.\nWe operate in the oil and gas industry and experience intense competition from other independent retail and wholesale gasoline marketing companies and ethanol producers. The U.S. marketing petroleum business is highly competitive, particularly with regard to accessing and marketing petroleum and other refined products. We compete with other chains of retail fuel stations for fuel supply and in the retail sale of refined products to end consumers, primarily on the basis of price, but also on the basis of convenience and consumer appeal. In addition, we may also face competition from other retail fueling stations that adopt marketing strategies similar to ours by associating with non-traditional retailers, such as supermarkets, discount club stores and hypermarkets, particularly in the geographic areas in which we operate. We expect that our industry will continue to trend toward this model, resulting in increased competition to us over time. Moreover, because we do not produce or refine any of the petroleum or other refined products that we market and Murphy Oil does not supply us with refined products, we compete with retail gasoline companies that have ongoing supply relationships with affiliates or former affiliates that manufacture refined products. We also compete with integrated companies that have their own production and/or refining operations that are at times able to offset losses from marketing operations with profits from producing or refining operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed retail margins or supply shortages. In addition, we compete with other retail and wholesale gasoline marketing companies that have more extensive retail outlets and greater brand name recognition. Some of our competitors have been in existence longer than we have and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our business and may be able to respond better to changes in the\neconomy and new opportunities within the industry. Such competition could adversely affect us, including our profitability, our ability to grow and our ability to manage our business.\nIn addition, the retail gasoline industry in the United States is highly competitive due to ease of entry and constant change in the number and type of retailers offering similar products and services. With respect to merchandise, our retail sites compete with other convenience store chains, independently owned convenience stores, supermarkets, drugstores, discount clubs, gasoline service stations, mass merchants, fast food operations and other similar retail outlets. In recent years, several non-traditional retailers, including supermarkets, discount club stores and mass merchants, have begun to compete directly with retail gasoline sites. These non-traditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the gasoline market, and their market share is expected to grow, and these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts, both at the fuel pump and in the convenience store, to encourage in-store merchandise sales and gasoline sales. In addition, some large retailers and supermarkets are adjusting their store layouts and product prices in an attempt to appeal to convenience store customers. Major competitive factors include: location, ease of access, product and service selection, gasoline brands, pricing, customer service, store appearance, cleanliness and safety. Competition from these retailers may reduce our market share and our revenues, and the resulting impact on our business and results of operations could be materially adverse.\nChanges in consumer behavior and travel as a result of changing economic conditions, the development of alternative energy technologies or otherwise could affect our business.\nIn the retail gasoline industry, customer traffic is generally driven by consumer preferences and spending trends, growth rates for commercial truck traffic and trends in travel and weather. Changes in economic conditions generally, or in the regions in which we operate, could adversely affect consumer spending patterns and travel in our markets. In particular, weakening economic conditions may result in decreases in miles driven and discretionary consumer spending and travel, which affect spending on gasoline and convenience items. In addition, changes in the types of products and services demanded by consumers may adversely affect our merchandise sales and gross margin. Additionally, negative publicity or perception surrounding gasoline suppliers could adversely affect their reputation and brand image, which may negatively affect our gasoline sales and gross margin. Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demands and preferences while continuing to sell products and services that remain relevant to the consumer and thus will positively impact overall retail gross margin.\nSimilarly, advanced technology, improved fuel efficiency and increased use of \u201cgreen\u201d automobiles (e.g., those automobiles that do not use gasoline or that are powered by hybrid engines) would reduce demand for gasoline. Developments regarding climate change and the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change and the environment may lead to increased use of \u201cgreen\u201d automobiles. Consequently, attitudes toward gasoline and its relationship to the environment may significantly affect our sales and ability to market our products. Reduced consumer demand for gasoline could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations and earnings have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide political developments.\nMany governments, including those that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d), unilaterally intervene at times in the orderly market of petroleum and natural gas produced in their countries through such actions as setting prices, determining rates of production, and controlling who may buy and sell the production. In addition, prices and availability of petroleum, natural gas and refined products could be influenced by political unrest and by various governmental policies to restrict or increase petroleum usage and supply. Other governmental actions that could affect our operations and earnings include tax changes, royalty increases and regulations concerning: currency fluctuations, protection and remediation of the environment, concerns over the possibility of global warming being affected by human activity including the production and use of hydrocarbon energy, restraints and controls on imports and exports, safety, and relationships between employers and employees. As a retail gasoline marketing company, we are significantly affected by these factors. Because these and other factors are subject to changes caused by governmental and political\nconsiderations and are often made in response to changing internal and worldwide economic conditions and to actions of other governments or specific events, it is not practical to attempt to predict the effects of such factors on our future operations and earnings.\nOur business is subject to operational hazards and risks normally associated with the marketing of petroleum products.\nWe operate in many different locations around the United States. The occurrence of an event, including but not limited to acts of nature such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other forms of severe weather, and mechanical equipment failures, industrial accidents, fires, explosions, acts of war and intentional terrorist attacks could result in damage to our facilities, and the resulting interruption and loss of associated revenues; environmental pollution or contamination; and personal injury, including death, for which we could be deemed to be liable, and which could subject us to substantial fines and/or claims for punitive damages.\nWe store gasoline in storage tanks at our retail sites. Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in storing gasoline. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, fires, explosions, spills, discharges and other releases, any of which could result in distribution difficulties and disruptions, environmental pollution, governmentally imposed fines or cleanup obligations, personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to our properties and the properties of others. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our assets such as gasoline terminals and certain retail fueling stations lie near the U.S. coastline and are vulnerable to hurricane and tropical storm damages, which may result in shutdowns. The U.S. hurricane season runs from June through November, but the most severe storm activities usually occur in late summer, such as with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Although we maintain insurance for certain of these risks as described below, due to policy deductibles and possible coverage limits, weather-related risks are not fully insured.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, which could expose us to significant expenditures, liabilities or obligations and reduce product demand.\nWe are subject to stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum products and hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of such substances into the environment; the content and characteristics of fuel products; the process safety of our facilities; and human health and safety. Pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations, we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. While we strive to abide by these requirements, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to litigation, fines or other sanctions. Environmental requirements, and the enforcement and interpretation thereof, change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time. Compliance with existing and future environmental laws, regulations and permits may require significant expenditures. In addition, to the extent fuel content and characteristic standards increase our wholesale purchase costs, we may be adversely affected if we are unable to recover such costs in our pricing.\nWe could be subject to joint and several as well as strict liability for environmental contamination, without regard to fault or the legality of our conduct. In particular, we could be liable for contamination relating to properties that we own, lease or operate or that we or our predecessors previously owned, leased or operated. Substantially all of these properties have or in the past had storage tanks to store motor fuel or petroleum products. Leaks from such tanks may impact soil or groundwater and could result in substantial cleanup costs. We could also be held responsible for contamination relating to third-party sites to which we or our predecessors have sent hazardous materials. In addition to potentially significant investigation and remediation costs, any such contamination, leaks from storage tanks or other releases of hazardous materials can give rise to claims from governmental authorities and other third parties for fines or penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury and property damage.\nOur business is also affected by fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) vehicle emission reduction measures. As such fuel economy and GHG reduction requirements become more stringent over time, consumer demand for our products may be adversely affected. In addition, some of our facilities are subject to GHG regulation. We are currently required to report annual GHG emissions from certain of our operations, and additional GHG emission-related requirements that may affect our business have been finalized or are in various phases of discussion or implementation. Any existing or future GHG emission requirements could result in increased operating costs and additional compliance expenses.\nOur expenditures, liabilities and obligations relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, product demand, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture tobacco legislation, campaigns to discourage smoking, increases in tobacco taxes and wholesale cost increases of tobacco products could have a material adverse impact on our retail operating revenues and gross margin.\nSales of tobacco products have historically accounted for an important portion of our total sales of convenience store merchandise. Significant increases in wholesale cigarette costs and tax increases on tobacco products, as well as future legislation and national and local campaigns to discourage smoking in the United States, may have an adverse effect on the demand for tobacco products, and therefore reduce our revenues and profits. Also, increasing regulations for e-cigarettes and vapor products could offset some of the recent gains we have experienced from selling these products. Competitive pressures in our markets can make it difficult to pass price increases on to our customers. These factors could materially and adversely affect our retail price of cigarettes, cigarette unit volume and sales, merchandise gross margin and overall customer traffic. Reduced sales of tobacco products or smaller gross margins on the sales we make could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrently, major cigarette manufacturers offer substantial rebates to retailers. We include these rebates as a component of our gross margin. In the event these rebates are no longer offered, or decreased, our profit from cigarette sales will decrease accordingly. In addition, reduced retail display allowances on cigarettes offered by cigarette manufacturers would negatively affect gross margins. These factors could materially affect our retail price of cigarettes, cigarette unit volume and revenues, merchandise gross margin and overall customer traffic, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur retail operations are subject to extensive government laws and regulations, and the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations can be material.\nOur retail operations are subject to extensive local, state and federal governmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the sale of alcohol, tobacco and money orders, employment conditions, including minimum wage requirements, and public accessibility requirements. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, failure to comply with local, state and federal laws and regulations to which our operations are subject may result in penalties and costs that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn certain areas where our retail sites are located, state or local laws limit the retail sites\u2019 hours of operation or their sale of alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, possible inhalants and lottery tickets, in particular to minors. Failure to comply with these laws could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations because these state and local regulatory agencies have the power to revoke, suspend or deny applications for and renewals of permits and licenses relating to the sale of these products or to seek other remedies, such as the imposition of fines or other penalties.\nRegulations related to wages also affect our business. Any appreciable increase in the statutory minimum wage would result in an increase in our labor costs and such cost increase, or the penalties for failing to comply with such statutory minimums, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn compliance with U.S. health care reform legislation, we have implemented a \u201cbronze level\u201d health care offering to our eligible non-exempt field employees. The offering is projected to increase labor costs by an immaterial amount in 2015. To date, initial enrollment is lower than projected. We expect that as awareness of the taxpayer non-compliance penalty and related increases in this penalty takes effect, enrollment will increase and such increases could be significant enough to materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny changes in the laws or regulations described above that are adverse to us and our properties could affect our operating and financial performance. In addition, new regulations are proposed from time to time which, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFuture consumer or other litigation could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur retail operations are characterized by a high volume of customer traffic and by transactions involving a wide array of product selections. These operations carry a higher exposure to consumer litigation risk when compared to the operations of companies operating in many other industries. Consequently, we have been, and may in the future be from time to time, involved in lawsuits seeking cash settlements for alleged personal injuries, property damages and other business-related matters, as well as energy content, off-specification gasoline, products liability and other legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. While these actions are generally routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our business, if our assessment of any action or actions should prove inaccurate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. For more information about our legal matters, see Note 18 \u201cContingencies\u201d to the consolidated and combined historical financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2014 included in this Form 10-K. Further, adverse publicity about consumer or other litigation may negatively affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are true, by discouraging customers from purchasing gasoline or merchandise at our retail sites.\nWe rely on our IT systems and network infrastructure to manage numerous aspects of our business, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on our IT systems and network infrastructure to manage numerous aspects of our business and provide analytical information to management. These systems are an essential component of our business and growth strategies, and a serious disruption to them could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently. These systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, security breaches and computer viruses, which could result in a loss of sensitive business information, systems interruption or the disruption of our business operations. To protect against unauthorized access or attacks, we have implemented infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans, but there can be no assurance that a technology systems breach or systems failure, which may occur and go undetected, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive customer, employee or vendor data or to comply with applicable regulations relating to data security and privacy.\nIn the normal course of our business as a gasoline and merchandise retailer, we obtain large amounts of personal data, including credit and debit card information from our customers. While we have invested significant amounts in the protection of our IT systems and maintain what we believe are adequate security controls over individually identifiable customer, employee and vendor data provided to us, a breakdown or a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data could nonetheless occur and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition. Such a breakdown or breach could also materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such risks. Also, a material failure on our part to comply with regulations relating to our obligation to protect such sensitive data or to the privacy rights of\nour customers, employees and others could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use and gross receipts taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and if securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable research reports about our business or if they downgrade their rating on our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly. The trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in quarterly or annual results of operations, especially if they differ from our previously announced guidance or forecasts made by analysts;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us of anticipated future revenues or operating results, or by others concerning us, our competitors, our customers, or our industry;\n\u00b7\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive environment;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments;\n\u00b7\nlimited analyst coverage; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in overall stock market conditions, including the stock prices of our competitors.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and certain provisions of Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of us.\nThe existence of some provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:\n\u00b7\nproviding for a classified board of directors;\n\u00b7\nproviding that our directors may be removed by our stockholders only for cause;\n\u00b7\nestablishing supermajority vote requirements for our shareholders to amend certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws;\n\u00b7\nauthorizing a large number of shares of stock that are not yet issued, which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders or taking action by written consent; and\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at the annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that could have resulted in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock.\nThese provisions apply even if a takeover offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other rights, and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or dividend, distribution or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nOur Bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a preferred judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Delaware General Corporation Law, our Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations for any class or series of our preferred stock) or our Bylaws, in each case, as amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provision. This forum selection provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable or cost-effective for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees.\nWe may not achieve the intended benefits of having an exclusive forum provision if it is found to be unenforceable.\nWe have included an exclusive forum provision in our Bylaws as described above. However, the enforceability of similar exclusive jurisdiction provisions in other companies\u2019 bylaws or certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any action, a court could find the exclusive jurisdiction provision contained in our Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. Although in June 2013 the Delaware Court of Chancery upheld the statutory and contractual validity of exclusive forum-selection bylaw provisions, the validity of such provisions is not yet settled law under the laws of Delaware. Furthermore, the Delaware Court of Chancery emphasized that such provisions may not be enforceable under circumstances where they are found to operate in an\nunreasonable or unlawful manner or in a manner inconsistent with a board\u2019s fiduciary duties. Also, it is uncertain whether non-Delaware courts consistently will enforce such exclusive forum-selection bylaw provisions. If a court were to find our choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions and we may not obtain the benefits of limiting jurisdiction to the courts selected.", "PERMNO": 14076, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "MUSA"}
