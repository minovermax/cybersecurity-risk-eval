RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this document. Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nA.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nA1.\nUncertainty exists regarding the impact of current and future sanctions imposed by governments and other authorities, including the United States, the European Union, and the United Kingdom in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nRecently, Russia initiated significant military action against Ukraine. In response, the U.S. and certain other countries imposed significant sanctions and export controls against Russia, and the U.S. and certain other countries could impose further sanctions, trade restrictions, and other retaliatory actions should the conflict continue or worsen. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of the conflict, including related geopolitical tensions, and the measures and retaliatory actions taken by the U.S. and other countries in respect thereof as well as any counter measures or retaliatory actions by Russia in response, including, for example, potential cyberattacks or the disruption of energy exports, is likely to cause regional instability, geopolitical shifts, and could materially adversely affect global trade, currency exchange rates, regional economies and the global economy. The situation remains uncertain, and while it is difficult to predict the impact of any of the foregoing, the conflict and actions taken in response to the conflict could increase our costs for crude oil, disrupt our supply chain, reduce our sales and earnings, impair our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA2.\nWe face numerous risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nSince the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted economies around the world, including the oil and gas industry in which we operate. The rapid spread of the virus led to the implementation of various responses, including federal, state, and local government-imposed quarantines, shelter-in-place mandates, sweeping restrictions on travel, and other public health and safety measures. Actions by members of OPEC and other producer countries in 2020 concerning oil production and pricing significantly impacted supply and demand in global oil and gas markets, which impacted our operational and financial performance. In particular, we experienced net losses due to unfavorable margins per bbl and significantly lower sales volume due to significant refinery downtime. Global oil prices and refined product demand recovered somewhat in 2021 compared to 2020 as COVID-19 cases stabilized, mortality rates decreased, and availability and inoculation rates of vaccines increased. However, recovery of jet fuel demand lagged that of other refined products as airline travel restrictions and consumer hesitancy to fly during the pandemic continued. Despite the uptick in market conditions during the second half of 2021, overall, we experienced operating and net losses due to unfavorable margins and lower sales volume, which affected our liquidity. Cash constraints adversely impacted the frequency of crude oil acquisition, debt payments, and abandonment of pipeline and facilities assets.\nThe extent to which the continued COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the pandemic, additional or modified government actions, new information that may emerge concerning variants, actions taken to contain the spread of COVID-19 and treat its impact, and the availability and acceptance of vaccines to mitigate such spread, among others.\nSome factors from the continued COVID-19 pandemic that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, include:\n\u00b7\nthird-party effects, including contractual and counterparty risk;\n\u00b7\nsupply/demand market and macro-economic forces;\n\u00b7\nlower commodity prices;\n\u00b7\nunavailable storage capacity and operational effects, including curtailments and shut-ins;\n\u00b7\ndecreased utilization and rates for our assets and services;\n\u00b7\nimpact on liquidity and access to capital markets;\n\u00b7\nworkforce reductions and furloughs; and\n\u00b7\nfederal, state, and local actions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and the extent to which the pandemic may impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects will depend highly on future developments, which are very uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Additionally, the extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our Common Stock price is uncertain and may make us look less attractive to investors and, as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock, our Common Stock price may be more volatile, and our ability to raise capital could be impaired.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 15\nA3.\nManagement has determined that there is, and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm expresses, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement has determined that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to defaults under our secured loan agreements, margin volatility, and historic net losses and working capital deficits. Our consolidated financial statements assume we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. A \u2018going concern\u2019 opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, incurring debt, or other financing alternatives. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on sustained positive operating margins and having working capital for, amongst other requirements, purchasing crude oil and condensate and making payments on long-term debt. Without positive operating margins and working capital, our business will be jeopardized, and we may not be able to continue. If we are unable to make required debt payments, we would likely have to consider other options, such as selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, cutting costs, or otherwise reducing our cash requirements, or negotiating with our creditors to restructure our applicable obligations, including potentially filing for bankruptcy.\nA4.\nWe have inadequate liquidity to sustain operations due to defaults under our secured loan agreements, substantial current debt, margin volatility, historic net losses and working capital deficits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe had $78.5 million and $72.3 million in working capital deficits at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding the current portion of long-term debt, we had $15.5 million and $22.6 million in working capital deficits at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $0.01 and $0.5 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Restricted cash (current portion) totaled $0.05 million at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. Restricted cash, noncurrent totaled $0 and $0.5 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWe currently rely on revenue from operations, including sales of refined products and rental of petroleum storage tanks, Affiliates, and financing to meet our liquidity needs. Our short-term working capital needs are primarily related to: (i) purchasing crude oil and condensate to operate the Nixon refinery, (ii) reimbursing LEH for direct operating expenses and paying the LEH operating fee under the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, (iii) servicing debt, (iv) maintaining and expanding the Nixon facility through capital expenditures, and (v) meeting regulatory compliance mandates. Our long-term working capital needs are primarily related to repayment of long-term debt obligations.\nDue to defaults under our secured loan agreements, substantial current debt, margin volatility, historic net losses and working capital deficits, we have inadequate liquidity to sustain operations. We continue to actively explore additional financing to meet working capital needs or refinance and restructure debt. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we successfully secured $10.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in working capital through CARES Act loans. In addition, subsequent to the period covered by this report, we secured an additional $1.5 million in working capital through modification of the existing BDEC Term Loan Due 2051. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital, we may not, in the short term, be able to purchase crude oil and condensate or meet debt payment obligations. In the long term, we may not be able to withstand business disruptions, such as from COVID-19, or execute our business strategy. We may have to consider other options, such as selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, seek bankruptcy protection, or cease operating.\nA5.\nOur substantial current debt, which is included in the current portion of long-term debt (in default) and long-term debt, related party (in default), could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nSubstantial current debt is primarily the result of secured loan agreements being in default. As a result, these debt obligations were classified within the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Excluding accrued interest, we had current debt of $63.0 million and $57.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nCurrent debt consists of bank debt, investor debt, and related party debt. Although the line of credit payable to Pilot fell within current debt during 2021, the Pilot debt was repaid in October 2021. For the twelve-months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, principal and interest payments to Veritex were $0.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively. For the twelve-months ended December 31, 2021, interest only payments to GNCU were $0.01 million. As of the filing date of this report, NPS was in default under the NPS Term Loan Due 2031 for failing to satisfy financial covenants. For both twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, principal and interest payments to John Kissick and related parties were $0. From June 2020 to October 2021, Pilot applied payments owed to NPS under two terminal services agreements against NPS\u2019 payment obligations to Pilot under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit. For the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the tank lease payment setoff totaled $1.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 16\nBlue Dolphin, as parent company, has guaranteed the indebtedness of certain subsidiaries. In addition, Affiliates have guaranteed the indebtedness of Blue Dolphin and certain of its subsidiaries. This level of debt in current liabilities and the cross guarantee agreements could have important consequences, such as: (i) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or potential growth, or for other purposes; (ii) increasing the cost of future borrowings; (iii) limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt; (iv) placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt; and (v) increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to service our debt is dependent upon, among other things, business conditions, our financial and operating performance, our ability to raise capital, and regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our working capital is not sufficient to service our debt, and any future indebtedness that we incur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nA6.\nOur ability to regain compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness depends on us generating sufficient cash flow to meet debt service obligations or refinancing or restructuring the debt.\nAs described elsewhere in this report, we are in default under our secured loan agreements with third parties and related parties, as follow:\n\u00b7\nVeritex - At December 31, 2021, and as of the filing date of this report, LE and LRM were in default under the LE Term Loan Due 2034 and LRM Term Loan Due 2034 for failing to make required monthly principal and interest payments and failing to satisfy financial covenants. In addition, LE was in default under the LE Term Loan Due 2034 for failing to replenish a $1.0 million payment reserve account.\n\u00b7\nGNCU - For the twelve-months ended December 31, 2021, interest only payments to GNCU were $0.01 million. As of the filing date of this report, NPS was in default under the NPS Term Loan Due 2031 for failing to satisfy financial covenants.\n\u00b7\nPilot - On October 4, 2021, NPS repaid all obligations owed to Pilot under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit. However, in a letter from NPS to Pilot dated October 28, 2021, NPS disputed approximately $0.3 million in payments NPS believes Pilot misapplied as part of the Amended Pilot Line of Credit setoff. As of the filing date of this report, the amount remained in dispute between the parties. We were in default prior to repayment. From June 2020 to October 2021, Pilot applied payments owed to NPS under two terminal services agreements against NPS\u2019 payment obligations to Pilot under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit. For the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the tank lease payment setoff totaled $1.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\n\u00b7\nKissick Debt - Pursuant to a 2015 subordination agreement, the holder of the Kissick Debt agreed to subordinate their right to payments from LE, as well as any security interest and liens on the Nixon facility\u2019s business assets, in favor of Veritex as holder of the LE Term Loan Due 2034. To date, no payments have been made under the subordinated Kissick Debt and the holder of the Kissick Debt has taken no action as a result of the non-payment. As of the filing date of this report, defaults under the Kissick Debt related to payment of past due obligations at maturity.\n\u00b7\nRelated Party Debt - Affiliates controlled approximately 82% of the voting power of our Common Stock as of the filing date of this report, an Affiliate operates and manages all Blue Dolphin properties, an Affiliate is a significant customer of our refined products, and we borrow from Affiliates during periods of working capital deficits. Related party debt, which is currently in default, represents such working capital borrowings. As of the filing date of this report, defaults under related-party debt were associated with payment of past due obligations at maturity.\nDefaults under our secured loan agreements permit third parties to declare the amounts owed under certain loan agreements immediately due and payable, exercise their rights with respect to collateral securing obligors\u2019 obligations under these loan agreements, and/or exercise any other rights and remedies available. The debt associated with secured loan agreements with third parties and related parties was classified within the current portion of long-term debt (in default) and long-term debt, related party (in default) on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021. The debt associated with secured loan agreements with third parties and related parties was classified within the current portion of long-term debt (in default), long-term debt, related party (in default), and line of credit payable (in default) on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020.\nOur ability to regain compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet debt service obligations or refinance or restructure the debt. This is dependent on, among other things, business conditions, our financial performance, and the general condition of the financial markets. We can provide no assurance that our assets or cash flow will be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our secured loan agreements. Continued disruptions to our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a material adverse effect on our business, result of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations. There can also be no assurance that our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations will revert to pre-2020 levels once the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic cease. Given the current financial markets, we can provide no assurance that we can successfully generate sufficient cash from operations to repay our outstanding debt or otherwise restructure or refinance the debt. We could be forced to undertake alternate financings, including a sale of additional common stock, negotiate for an extension of the maturity, or sell assets and delay capital expenditures in order to generate proceeds that could be used to repay such indebtedness. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to consummate any such transaction on terms that are commercially reasonable, on terms acceptable to us or at all. If new debt or other liabilities are added to the Company\u2019s current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that it now faces could intensify. If new debt or other liabilities are added to the Company\u2019s current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that it now faces could intensify. In the event we are unsuccessful in such endeavors, we may be unable to pay the amounts outstanding, which may require us to seek protection under bankruptcy laws. In such a case, the trading price of our Common Stock and the value of an investment in our Common Stock could significantly decrease, which could lead to holders of our Common Stock losing their investment in our Common Stock in its entirety.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 17\nA7.\nOur business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit.\nAdverse changes to the availability, terms, cost of capital, interest rates, or our credit ratings (which would have a corresponding impact on the credit ratings of our subsidiaries that are party to any cross-guarantee agreements) could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital, including our ability to refinance maturing or accelerated existing indebtedness on similar terms. In addition, increased crude acquisition costs could adversely impact our working capital. As a result, we cannot provide any assurance that any financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all. Any such financing could be dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we cannot raise required funds on acceptable terms, we may further reduce our expenses and we may not be able to, among other things, (i) maintain our general and administrative expenses at current levels; (ii) successfully implement our business strategy; (iii) fund certain obligations as they become due; (iv) respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements; (v) repay our indebtedness, or (vi) purchase crude oil to operate the Nixon facility. Based on the historical negative cash flows and the continued limited cash inflows in the period subsequent to year end there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nA8.\nRestrictive covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to service our indebtedness.\nVarious covenants in our debt instruments restrict our financial flexibility in a number of ways. Our current indebtedness subjects us to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, place liens upon assets, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments and investments, consummate certain asset sales or asset swaps, conduct businesses other than our current businesses, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Some of our debt instruments also require us to satisfy or maintain certain financial condition tests in certain circumstances. Our ability to meet these financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not meet such tests. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of our existing debt could result in a further event of default that could enable our lenders, subject to the terms and conditions of such debt, to declare the outstanding principal, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Events beyond our control, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental responses, volatility in commodity prices, and extreme weather resulting from climate change may affect our ability to comply with our covenants. If we are unable to repay the accelerated amounts, our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such debt. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, defaults under our other debt instruments, if any, may be triggered, and our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full. In addition, loans provided or guaranteed by the U.S. government, including pursuant to the CARES Act, subject us to additional restrictions on our operations, including limitations on personnel headcount and compensation reductions and other cost reduction activities that could adversely affect us.\nA9.\nAffiliates hold a significant ownership interest in us and exert significant influence over us, and their interests may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders; and affiliate transactions may cause conflicts of interest that may adversely affect us.\nWe have an indirect controlling stockholder. As a related party of an Affiliate, Jonathan Carroll indirectly owned 82% of the voting power of our Common Stock as of the filing date of this report, and by virtue of such stock ownership, Mr. Carroll can control or exert substantial influence over us, including:\n\u00b7\nElection and appointment of directors;\n\u00b7\nBusiness strategy and policies;\n\u00b7\nMergers and other business combinations;\n\u00b7\nAcquisition or disposition of assets;\n\u00b7\nFuture issuances of Common Stock or other securities; and\n\u00b7\nIncurrence of debt or obtaining other sources of financing.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 18\nThe existence of a controlling stockholder may have the effect of making it difficult for, or may discourage or delay, a third party from seeking to acquire a majority of our outstanding Common Stock, which may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nAffiliate interest may not always be consistent with our interests or with the interests of our other stockholders. Affiliates may also pursue acquisitions or business opportunities in industries in which we compete, and there is no requirement that any additional business opportunities be presented to us. We also have and may in the future enter transactions to purchase goods or services with Affiliates. To the extent that conflicts of interest may arise between us and Affiliates, those conflicts may be resolved in a manner adverse to us or its other stockholders.\nThese relationships could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our Board is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and Affiliates. The appearance of conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialize, might adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us, as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter new relationships in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business.\nA10.\nThe dangers inherent in oil and gas operations could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs, or liabilities, and reduce our liquidity.\nOil and gas operations are inherently subject to significant hazards and risks. We process, store, and handle crude oil and condensate, which, under certain circumstances, can be extremely dangerous. Hazards and risks related to the Nixon facility include, but are not limited to, catastrophic events caused by fires, explosions, pressure vessel ruptures, spills, third-party interference, electricity, and mechanical breakdown, any of which could result in interruption or termination of operations, pollution, personal injury and death, or damage to our assets and the property of others.\nOffshore operations are also subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment. Although our pipeline assets and leasehold interests in oil and gas wells are inactive, natural disasters and other events, such as hurricanes, can result in blowouts, cratering, explosions, and loss of well control. These hazards can cause injury to persons, loss of life, and damage to property or the environment.\nAny of these risks could result in substantial losses to us from a significant decrease in operations, significant additional costs to replace, repair, and insure assets, and from potential civil lawsuits, fines, penalties, and regulatory enforcement proceedings. We may also become subject to more extensive governmental regulation. These regulations may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for pollution damage or result in the interruption or termination of operations. These risks could also harm our reputation and business, result in claims against us, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nA11.\nThe geographic concentration of our assets creates a significant exposure to the risks of the regional economy and other regional adverse conditions.\nOur primary operating assets are in Nixon, Texas in the Eagle Ford Shale, and we market our refined products in a single, relatively limited geographic area. In addition, we have facilities and related onshore pipeline assets in Freeport, Texas, and offshore pipelines and oil and gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, our operations are more susceptible to regional economic conditions than our more geographically diversified competitors. Any changes in market conditions, unforeseen circumstances, or other events affecting the area in which our assets are located could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These factors include, among other things, changes in the economy, weather, demographics, and population.\nA12.\nCompetition from companies having greater financial and other resources could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe refining industry is highly competitive. Our refining operations compete with domestic refiners and marketers in PADD 3 (Gulf Coast), domestic refiners in other PADD regions, and foreign refiners that import products into the U.S. Certain of our competitors have larger, more complex refineries and may be able to realize higher margins per barrel of product produced. Several of our principal competitors are integrated national or international oil companies that are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do and have access to proprietary sources of controlled crude oil production. Unlike these competitors, we obtain all our feedstocks from a single supplier. Because of their integrated operations and larger capitalization, larger, more complex refineries may be more flexible in responding to volatile industry or market conditions, such as crude oil and other feedstocks supply shortages or commodity price fluctuations. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose existing customers or fail to acquire new customers.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 19\nA13.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to remain in compliance or to remediate current or future contamination that could give rise to material liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the environment, product specifications and the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal, and remediation of solid and hazardous wastes. Violations of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial penalties, injunctive orders compelling installation of additional controls, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns.\nIn addition, new environmental laws and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, increased governmental enforcement of laws and regulations, or other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. The requirements to be met, as well as the technology and length of time available to meet those requirements, continue to develop and change. Expenditures or costs for environmental compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and profitability. For example, President Biden has issued an executive order seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and to consider suspending, revising, or rescinding prior agency actions that are identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration\u2019s climate policies. The current administration may take further actions that could restrict or limit operations as currently conducted at the Nixon Facility.\nThe Nixon facility operates under several federal and state permits, licenses, and approvals with terms and conditions that contain a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards. These permits, licenses, approvals, limits, and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval, limit or standard. Non-compliance or incomplete documentation of our compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties, and injunctive relief. Additionally, there may be times when we are unable to meet the standards and terms and conditions of our permits, licenses, and approvals due to operational upsets or malfunctions, which may lead to the imposition of fines and penalties or operating restrictions that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our facilities, and accordingly our financial performance.\nA14.\nWe are subject to strict laws and regulations regarding personnel and process safety, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and profitability.\nWe are subject to the requirements of OSHA, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection, health, and safety of workers, and the proper design, operation, and maintenance of our equipment. In addition, OSHA and certain other environmental regulations require that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to personnel and state and local governmental authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring and control of occupational exposure to regulated substances, may result in significant fines or compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIn October 2021, LRM received a proposed agreed order from the TCEQ for alleged solid and hazardous waste violations discovered during an investigation from January 29, 2020 to March 2, 2020. The proposed agreed order assesses an administrative penalty of approximately $0.4 million and identifies actions needed to correct the alleged violations. We are currently seeking to negotiate a reduced penalty amount. However, we recorded a liability for the maximum proposed amount of $0.4 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.\nA15.\nOur insurance policies do not cover all losses, costs, or liabilities that we may experience, and insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry may cease to do so or substantially increase premiums.\nOur insurance program may not cover all operational risks and costs and may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim. We do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses and could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance, failure by one or more of our insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event, or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThere is finite capacity in the commercial insurance industry engaged in underwriting energy industry risk, and factors impacting cost and availability include: (i) losses in our industries, (ii) natural disasters, (iii) specific losses incurred by us, and (iv) inadequate investment returns earned by the insurance industry. If the supply of commercial insurance is curtailed, we may not be able to continue our present limits of insurance coverage, obtain sufficient insurance capacity to adequately insure our risks, or we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost. There is no assurance that our insurers will renew their insurance coverage on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of non-renewal. The unavailability of full insurance coverage to cover events in which we suffer significant losses or cancellation of insurance policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 20\nA16.\nOur ability to use NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation.\nUnder IRC Section 382, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Within the meaning of IRC Section 382, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs when the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% shareholders, applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).\nBlue Dolphin experienced ownership changes in 2005 because of a series of private placements, and in 2012 because of a reverse acquisition. The 2012 ownership change limits our ability to utilize NOLs following the 2005 ownership change that were not previously subject to limitation. Limitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect, and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. NOLs generated after the 2012 ownership change are not subject to limitation. If the IRS were to challenge our NOLs in an audit, we cannot assure that we would prevail against such challenge. If the IRS were successful in challenging our NOLs, all or some portion of our NOLs would not be available to offset any future consolidated income, which would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in 2017, may also limit our ability to utilize our net operating tax loss carryforwards.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, management determined that cumulative losses incurred over the prior three-year period provided significant objective evidence that limited the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as projections for future growth. Based on this evaluation, we recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nA17.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or development new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. We may not be able to respond do these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nA18.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. For example, Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine and resulting sanctions and export controls by the United States and other countries could have wide-ranging impacts that have yet to be identified. Given the evolving geopolitical situation, there are many unknown factors and events that could materially impact our operations, which may be temporary or permanent in nature. These tensions also create heightened risk of a terrorist attack or armed conflict involving the United States. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our production and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our operations or the operations of our customers\u2019 is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nA19.\nWe face various risks associated with increased activism against oil and natural gas companies.\nOpposition toward oil and natural gas companies has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the United States. Companies in the oil and natural gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, human rights, environmental matters, sustainability, and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain operations such as drilling and development. Any restrictions or limitations on our business or operations resulting from such opposition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 21\nA20.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats.\nA cyberattack or similar incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, damage to our reputation or financial loss. Our industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production, processing, and financial activities. Our technologies, systems, networks, or other proprietary information, and those of our vendors, suppliers, and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of proprietary and other information, or could otherwise lead to the disruption of our business operations. Cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period and could lead to disruptions in critical systems or the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information. These events could lead to financial loss from remedial actions, loss of business, disruption of operations, damage to our reputation or potential liability. Also, computers control nearly all the oil and gas distribution systems in the United States and abroad, which are necessary to transportation our production to market. A cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. Cyber incidents have increased, and the United States government has issued warnings indicating that energy assets may be specific targets of cybersecurity threats. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. Further, as cyberattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyberattacks.\nA21.\nAn outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business will be dependent upon the willingness and ability of our customers to conduct transactions. The spread of a highly infectious or contagious disease, such as COVID-19, could cause severe disruptions in the worldwide economy, which could in turn disrupt our business, activities, and operations, as well as that of our customers. Moreover, since the beginning of January 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the United States. The spread of COVID-19, or an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease, may result in a significant decrease in business and/or cause customers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations. A spread of COVID-19, or an outbreak of another contagious disease, could also negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business. Such a spread or outbreak could also negatively impact the business and operations of third-party providers who perform critical services for our business. If COVID-19, or another highly infectious or contagious disease, spreads or the response to contain COVID-19 is unsuccessful, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA22.\nPotential impairment in the carrying value of long-lived assets could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe have a significant amount of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Under generally accepted accounting principles, long-lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment annually or whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment. If business conditions or other factors cause the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows for long-lived assets to fall below their carrying value, we may be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our long-lived assets include lower realized refining margins, decreased refinery production, other factors leading to a reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability, or significant changes in the manner of use for the assets or the overall business strategy.\nIn this challenging business environment, we continuously monitor our assets for impairment, as well as optimization opportunities. We recorded an impairment of $1.1 million related to asset retirement costs for our pipeline/platform assets as of December 31, 2021. An additional impairment may be required in future periods if instabilities in the market continue long-term, losses continue to be material, or as new opportunities arise, such as reconfiguration of the Nixon refinery into a renewable fuels facility.\nSignificant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results that are used in the preparation of projected cash flows. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment analysis will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Should our assumptions significantly change in future periods, it is possible we may later determine the carrying values of our refinery and facilities assets exceed the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows, which would result in a future impairment charge.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 22\nB.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nB1.\nRefining margins, which are affected by commodity prices and refined product demand, are volatile, and a reduction in refining margins will adversely affect the amount of cash we will have available for working capital.\nHistorically, refining margins have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship between our crude oil and condensate acquisition costs, the commodity prices at which we ultimately sell our refined products, and the volume of refined products that we sell, all of which depend upon numerous factors beyond our control. The commodity prices at which we sell our refined products are strongly influenced by the commodity price of crude oil. If crude oil commodity prices increase, our \u2018refinery operations\u2019 business segment margins will fall unless we can pass along these commodity price increases to our wholesale customers. Increases in the selling prices for refined products typically trail the rising crude oil cost and may be difficult to implement when crude oil costs increase dramatically over a short period. Sharp decreases in refined product market demand, such as the record low demand that has occurred because of widespread COVID-19 related travel restrictions, can adversely affect our refining margins.\nB2.\nThe commodity price volatility of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined products, and fuel and utility services may have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, and liquidity.\nCrude oil refining is primarily a margin-based business. To improve margins, we must maximize yields of higher value finished petroleum products and minimize costs of feedstocks and operating expenses. When the spread between these commodity prices decreases, our margins are negatively affected. Although an increase or decrease in the commodity price for crude oil and other feedstocks generally results in a similar increase or decrease in commodity prices for finished petroleum products, typically there is a time lag between the two. The effect of crude oil commodity price changes on our finished petroleum product commodity prices therefore depends, in part, on how quickly and how fully the market adjusts to reflect these changes. Unfavorable margins may have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, and liquidity.\nThe markets and commodity prices for crude oil and condensate and our finished products have historically been volatile, are likely to continue to be volatile, and depend on factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nthe level of domestic and offshore production;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of crude oil and U.S. and global demand for this commodity;\n\u00b7\na general downturn in economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of weather, including abnormally mild or extreme winter or summer weather that cause lower or higher energy usage for heating or cooling purposes, respectively, or extreme weather that may disrupt our operations or related upstream or downstream operations;\n\u00b7\nactions taken by foreign oil and gas producing and importing nations, including the ability or willingness of OPEC and OPEC+ to set and maintain pricing and production levels for oil, which, for example, had a pronounced effect on global commodity prices for crude oil and the volatility thereof in 2020 during the onset and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of local, intrastate, and interstate transportation systems;\n\u00b7\nconflicts, such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and marketing of competitive fuels; and\n\u00b7\nthe extent of governmental regulation and taxation.\nB3.\nOur future success depends on our ability to acquire sufficient levels of crude oil on favorable terms to operate the Nixon refinery.\nOperation of the Nixon refinery depends on our ability to purchase adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate. Although we have no crude oil reserves and are not engaged in the exploration or production of crude oil, we believe that we can obtain adequate crude oil and other feedstocks at generally competitive commodity prices for the foreseeable future. We have a long-term crude supply agreement in place with Tartan. The volume-based Crude Supply Agreement expires when we receive 24.8 million net bbls of crude oil. After that, the Crude Supply Agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms. Either party may provide the other with notice of non-renewal at least 60 days before the expiration of any renewal term. As of December 31, 2021, we received 9.0 million bbls, or 36%, of the contracted total volume under the Crude Supply Agreement.\nPilot and Tartan store jet fuel and crude oil, respectively, at the Nixon facility under two terminal services agreements: (i) a Terminal Services Agreement dated as of May 2019 (covering Tank Nos. 67, 71, 72, 73, 77, and 78) for jet fuel and (ii) a Terminal Services Agreement dated as of June 1, 2019 (covering Tank Nos. 1 and 56) for crude oil. Under both terminal services agreements, Pilot and Tartan store product at the Nixon facility at a specified rate per bbl of the storage tank\u2019s shell capacity. The terminal services agreements renew on a one-year evergreen basis. Either party may terminate the terminal services agreements by providing the other party 60 days prior written notice. The terminal services agreements will automatically terminate upon expiration or termination of the Crude Supply Agreement.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 23\nB4.\nFailure to acquire crude oil and condensate when needed could have a material effect on our ability to operate the Nixon facility at the desired rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nGiven the large dollar amount required to make crude oil purchases, liquidity constraints could cause us to delay purchases of crude oil or otherwise acquire less than the desired amounts. This, in turn, could cause us to operate the Nixon facility at a lower rate on a bpd basis to meet customer demand. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021, the refinery experienced 13 days of downtime due to lack of crude associated with cash constraints. Failure to operate the Nixon facility at the desired run rate, or at all, could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.\nB5.\nDowntime at the Nixon refinery could result in lost margin opportunity, increased maintenance expense, increased inventory, and a reduction in cash available for payment of our obligations.\nThe Nixon refinery periodically undergoes planned and unplanned temporary shutdowns. We typically complete a planned turnaround annual to repair, restore, refurbish, or replace refinery equipment. Occasionally, unplanned shutdowns occur. Unplanned downtime can occur for a variety of reasons; however, common reasons for unplanned downtime include repair/replacement of disabled equipment, crude deficiencies associated with cash constraints, high temperatures, and power outages. We are particularly vulnerable to operation disruptions because all our refining operations occur at a single facility. Any scheduled or unscheduled downtime results in lost margin opportunity, reduced refined products inventory, and potential increased maintenance expense, all of which could reduce our ability to meet our payment obligations.\nDuring the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021, the refinery experienced 23 days of downtime - 13 days due to lack of crude associated with cash constraints and 10 days related to utility failure during Winter Storm Uri. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, the refinery experienced 42 days of downtime - 20 days due to lack of crude associated with cash constraints, 13 days for a planned turnaround, and 9 days for equipment repairs and maintenance. Any scheduled or unscheduled downtime will result in lost margin opportunity, potential increased maintenance expense, and a reduction of refined products inventory, which could reduce our ability to meet our payment obligations.\nB6.\nWe may have capital needs for which internally generated cash flows and external financing are inadequate. Affiliates may, but are not required to, fund our working capital requirements in such instances.\nWe have historically relied on Affiliates for funding when revenue from operations and availability under bank facilities were insufficient to meet our liquidity and working capital needs. We reflect such borrowings in our consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable, related party, or long-term debt, related party. At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, accounts payable, related party totaled $0.2 million. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, long-term debt, related party, current portion (in default) and accrued interest payable, related party totaled $23.5 million and $18.8 million, respectively.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity from Affiliates or external financing, we may not be able to meet our short- and long-term working capital needs. Our short-term working capital needs are primarily related to: (i) purchasing crude oil and condensate to operate the Nixon refinery, (ii) reimbursing LEH for direct operating expenses and paying the LEH operating fee under the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, (iii) servicing debt, (iv) maintaining and expanding the Nixon facility through capital expenditures, and (v) meeting regulatory compliance mandates. Our long-term working capital needs are primarily related to repayment of long-term debt obligations.\nThere can be no assurance that Affiliates will continue to fund our working capital requirements. If we are unable to generate sufficient working capital or raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not, in the short term, be able to purchase crude oil and condensate or meet debt payment obligations. In the long term, we may not be able to withstand business disruptions, such as from COVID-19, or execute our business strategy. We may have to consider other options, such as selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, seek bankruptcy protection, or cease operating.\nB7.\nOur business may suffer if any of the executive officers or other key personnel discontinue employment with us. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled labor or disruptions in our labor force may make it difficult for us to maintain productivity.\nOur future success depends on the services of the executive officers and other key personnel and on our continuing ability to recruit, train and retain highly qualified personnel in all areas of our operations. In particular, Jonathan Carroll currently serves as our principal executive, principal financial and principal accounting officer. We are highly dependent on his continued services to execute on our business plan and strategy. Furthermore, our operations require skilled and experienced personnel with proficiency in multiple tasks. Competition for skilled personnel with industry-specific experience is intense, and the loss of these executives or personnel could harm our business. If any of these executives or other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 24\nB8.\nLoss of business from, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, one or more of our significant customers, one of which is an Affiliate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nWe have bulk term contracts in place with most of our customers, including month-to-month, six months, and up to one-year terms. Certain of our contracts require our customers to prepay and us to sell fixed quantities and/or minimum quantities of finished and intermediate petroleum products. Many of these arrangements are subject to periodic renegotiation on a forward-looking basis, which could result in higher or lower relative commodity prices on future sales of our refined products.\nOur customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from. As a result, they can make substantial demands on us, including demands for more favorable product pricing or contractual terms. Our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance. Our operating results could be harmed if a key customer is lost, reduces their order quantity, requires us to reduce our commodity prices, is acquired by a competitor, or suffers financial hardship. Additionally, our profitability could be adversely affected if there is consolidation among our customer base and our customers command increased leverage in negotiating commodity prices and other terms of sale. We could decide not to sell our refined products to a certain customer if, because of increased leverage, the customer pressures us to reduce our pricing such that our gross profits are diminished, which could result in a decrease in our revenue. Consolidation may also lead to reduced demand for our products, replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors, and cancellations of orders, each of which could harm our operating results. Loss of business from, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, one or more of our major customers could similarly affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nOne of our significant customers is LEH, an Affiliate. Due to a HUBZone certification, the Affiliate purchases our jet fuel under a Jet Fuel Sales Agreement and bids on jet fuel contracts under preferential pricing terms. The Affiliate accounted for 29.9% and 28.7% of total revenue from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Affiliate represented $0 in accounts receivable at both December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nB9.\nWe are dependent on third parties for the transportation of crude oil and condensate into and refined products out of our Nixon facility; if these third parties become unavailable to us, our ability to process crude oil and condensate and sell refined products to wholesale markets could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on trucks for the receipt of crude oil and condensate into and the sale of refined products out of our Nixon facility. Since we do not own or operate any of these trucks, their continuing operation is not within our control. If any of the third-party trucking companies that we use, or the trucking industry in general, become unavailable to transport crude oil, condensate, and/or our refined products because of acts of God, accidents, government regulation, terrorism or other events, our revenue and net income would be materially and adversely affected.\nB10.\nOur suppliers source a substantial amount, if not all, of our crude oil and condensate from the Eagle Ford Shale and may experience interruptions of supply from that region.\nOur suppliers source a substantial amount, if not all, of our crude oil and condensate from the Eagle Ford Shale. Consequently, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of supply from that region caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, unavailability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, severe weather, plant closures for scheduled maintenance, or the interruption of oil or natural gas being transported from wells in that area.\nB11.\nOur refining operations and customers are primarily located within the Eagle Ford Shale and changes in the supply/demand balance in this region could result in lower refining margins.\nOur primary operating assets are in Nixon, Texas in the Eagle Ford Shale, and we market our refined products in a single, relatively limited geographic area. Therefore, we are more susceptible to regional economic conditions than our more geographically diversified competitors. Should the supply/demand balance shift in our region due to changes in the local economy, an increase in refining capacity or other reasons, resulting in supply in the PADD 3 (Gulf Coast) region to exceed demand, we would have to deliver refined products to customers outside of our current operating region and thus incur considerably higher transportation costs, resulting in lower refining margins.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 25\nB12.\nSevere weather or other events affecting our facilities, or those of our vendors, suppliers, or customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to all of the risks and operational hazards inherent in receiving, handling, storing, and transferring crude oil and petroleum products, including: damages to facilities, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by severe weather (such as extreme cold or hot temperatures, hurricanes, floods, and other natural disasters) or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, mechanical or structural failures, explosions, fires, spills, or acts of terrorism) at our facilities or at third-party facilities on which our operations are dependent could result in severe damage or destruction to our assets or the temporary or permanent shut-down of our operations. If we are unable to operate, our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially affected.\nB13.\nRegulatory changes, as well as proposed measures that are reasonably likely to be enacted, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could require us to incur significant costs or could result in a decrease in demand for our refined products, which could adversely affect our business.\nScientific studies conclusively show that, in the absence of human intervention, the rate of increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will significantly increase in the next 100 years. This increase in carbon dioxide has enhanced the Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect, resulting in global warming. Higher concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can produce changes in climate with significant physical effects, including increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other extreme weather events that could affect our operations. Increased concern over the effects of climate change have begun to affect our competition and customers\u2019 energy strategies, consumer consumption patterns, and government and private sector alternative energy initiatives. Changing customer sentiment towards renewable and sustainable energy products may reduce demand for our products, and an excess of supply over demand could reduce fossil fuel prices. In addition, if we fail to stay in step with the pace and extent of the market shift we could impact future earnings; if we move too fast we risk investing in technologies, markets, and low-carbon products that will be unsuccessful These factors could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBoth houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, including proposals to: (i) establish a Cap-and-Trade system, (ii) create a federal renewable energy or \u201cclean\u201d energy standard requiring electric utilities to provide a certain percentage of power from such sources, and (iii) create enhanced incentives for use of renewable energy and increased efficiency in energy supply and use. In addition, the EPA is taking steps to regulate greenhouse gases under the existing federal CAA. The EPA has already adopted regulations limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles, addressing the permitting of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources, and requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources, including refineries. Various states, individually as well as in some cases on a regional basis, have taken steps to control greenhouse gas emissions, including adoption of greenhouse gas reporting requirements, Cap-and-Trade systems, and renewable portfolio standards. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, has also been a focus of the Biden Administration. In February 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement, and in April 2021 the Biden Administration announced a new target for the United States to achieve a 50-52 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030. These and similar regulations could require us to incur costs to monitor, report, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with our operations.\nRequirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain the Nixon facility as well as implement and manage new emission controls and programs. For example, some states have passed regulations, such as Cap-and-Trade and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions below set targets by 2030 and beyond. Cap-and-Trade places a cap on greenhouse gases and refiners are required to acquire a sufficient number of credits to cover emissions from their refinery and in-state sales of gasoline and diesel. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard requires an established percentage reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel by a specified time period. Compliance with the Low Carbon Fuel Standard is achieved through blending lower carbon intensity biofuels into gasoline and diesel or by purchasing credits. Compliance with each of these programs is facilitated through a market-based credit system. If sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase or refiners are unable to pass through costs to their customers, they must pay a higher price for credits. It is currently uncertain how the current presidential administration or future administrations will address greenhouse gas emissions. In the event we do incur increased costs as a result of increased efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions, we may not be able to pass on any of these costs to our customers. Regulatory requirements also could adversely affect demand for the refined petroleum products that we produce. Any increased costs or reduced demand could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 26\nB14.\nWe may not be successful in integrating or pursuing acquisitions in the future.\nAlthough we regularly engage in discussions with, and submit proposals to, acquisition candidates, suitable acquisitions may not be available in the future on reasonable terms. Even if we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition, finance the acquisition, or, if the acquisition occurs, effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing businesses. Negotiations of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired business operations may require a disproportionate amount of management\u2019s attention and our resources. Even if we complete additional acquisitions, continued acquisition financing may not be available or available on reasonable terms, any new businesses may not generate the anticipated level of revenues, the anticipated cost efficiencies, or synergies may not be realized, and these businesses may not be integrated successfully or operated profitably. Our inability to successfully identify, execute, or effectively integrate future acquisitions may negatively affect our results of operations.\nC.\nRisks Related to Pipeline and Facilities Assets, as well as our Pipelines and Oil and Gas Properties\nC1.\nAssessment of civil penalties by BOEM for our failure to satisfy orders to provide additional financial assurance (supplemental pipeline bonds) within the time period prescribed.\nTo cover the various obligations of lessees and rights-of-way holders operating in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, BOEM evaluates an operator\u2019s financial ability to carry out present and future obligations to determine whether the operator must provide additional security beyond the statutory bonding requirements. Such obligations include the cost of plugging and abandoning wells and decommissioning pipelines and platforms at the end of production or service activities. Once plugging and abandonment work has been completed, the collateral backing the financial assurance is released by BOEM.\nBDPL historically maintained $0.9 million in financial assurance to BOEM for the decommissioning of its trunk pipeline offshore in federal waters. Following an agency restructuring of the financial assurance program, in March 2018 BOEM ordered BDPL to provide additional financial assurance totaling approximately $4.8 million for five (5) existing pipeline rights-of-way. In June 2018, BOEM issued BDPL INCs for each right-of-way that failed to comply. BDPL appealed the INCs to the IBLA. Although the IBLA granted multiple extension requests, the Office of the Solicitor of the U.S. Department of the Interior indicated that BOEM would not consent to further extensions. The solicitor\u2019s office signaled that BDPL\u2019s adherence to milestones identified in an August 2019 meeting between management and BSEE may help in future discussions with BOEM related to the INCs. Decommissioning of these assets will significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of financial assurance required by BOEM, which may serve to partially or fully resolve the INCs. Decommissioning of these assets was delayed due to our cash constraints associated with historical net losses and the ongoing impact of COVID-19. We cannot currently estimate when decommissioning may occur.\nBDPL\u2019s pending appeal of the BOEM INCs does not relieve BDPL of its obligations to provide additional financial assurance or of BOEM\u2019s authority to impose financial penalties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet additional financial assurance (supplemental pipeline bond) requirements. If BDPL is required by BOEM to provide significant additional financial assurance (supplemental pipeline bonds) or is assessed significant penalties under the INCs, we will experience a significant and material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nWe are currently unable to predict the outcome of the BOEM INCs. Accordingly, we did not record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, BDPL maintained approximately $0.9 million in credit and cash-backed pipeline rights-of-way bonds issued to BOEM.\nC2.\nAssessment of civil penalties by BSEE for our failure to decommission pipeline and platform assets within the time periods prescribed.\nBDPL has pipelines and platform assets that are subject to BSEE\u2019s idle iron regulations. Idle iron regulations mandate lessees and rights-of-way holders to permanently abandon and/or remove platforms and other structures when they are no longer useful for operations. Until such structures are abandoned or removed, lessees and rights-of-way holders are required to inspect and maintain the assets in accordance with regulatory requirements.\nIn December 2018, BSEE issued an INC to BDPL for failure to flush and fill Pipeline Segment No. 13101. Management met with BSEE in August 2019 to address BDPL\u2019s plans with respect to decommissioning its offshore pipelines and platform assets. BSEE proposed that BDPL re-submit pipeline and platform decommissioning permit applications, including a safe boarding plan, by February 2020. BDPL submitted permit applications to BSEE in February 2020 and the USACOE in March 2020. In April 2020, BSEE issued another INC to BDPL for failure to perform the required structural surveys for the GA-288C Platform. BDPL completed the required platform surveys in June 2020. Abandonment operations were delayed due to our cash constraints associated with historical net losses and the ongoing impact of COVID-19. We cannot currently estimate when decommissioning may occur.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 27\nLack of permit approvals does not relieve BDPL of its obligations to remedy the BSEE INCs or of BSEE\u2019s authority to impose financial penalties. If BDPL fails to complete decommissioning of the offshore pipelines and platform assets and/or remedy the INCs within a timeframe determined to be prudent by BSEE, BDPL could be subject to regulatory oversight and enforcement, including but not limited to failure to correct an INC, civil penalties, and revocation of BDPL\u2019s operator designation, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe are currently unable to predict the outcome of the BSEE INCs. Accordingly, we have not recorded a liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, BDPL maintained $3.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively, in AROs related to abandonment of these assets.\nD.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nD1.\nOur stock price has experienced fluctuations and may continue to do so, resulting in a substantial loss in your investment.\nThe market for our Common Stock has been characterized by volatile prices. As a result, investors in our Common Stock may experience a decrease in the value of their securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. The market price of our Common Stock is likely to be highly unpredictable and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nQuarterly variations in our operating results and achievement of key business metrics.\n\u00b7\nChanges in the global economy and the local economies in which we operate.\n\u00b7\nOur ability to obtain working capital financing.\n\u00b7\nChanges in the federal, state, and local laws and regulations to which we are subject.\n\u00b7\nMarket reaction to any acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors.\n\u00b7\nThe departure of any of our key executive officers and directors.\n\u00b7\nFuture sales of our securities.\nD2.\nOur stock price may decline due to sales of shares.\nAffiliates sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock and impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities in the future. Affiliates could elect in the future to request that we file a registration statement to them to sell shares of our Common Stock. If Affiliates were to sell a large number of shares into the public markets, Affiliates could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nD3.\nWe are authorized to issue up to a total of 20 million shares of our Common Stock and 2.5 million shares of preferred stock; issuance of additional shares would further dilute the equity ownership of current holders and potentially dilute the share price of our Common Stock.\nWe periodically issue Common Stock to non-employee directors for services rendered to the Board and to Jonathan Carroll pursuant to the Guaranty Fee Agreements. In the past, we have also issued Common Stock, Preferred Stock, convertible securities (such as convertible notes), and warrants in order to raise capital. We believe that it is necessary to maintain a sufficient number of available authorized shares of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock to provide us with the flexibility to issue Common Stock or Preferred Stock for business purposes that may arise as deemed advisable by our Board. These purposes could include, among other things, (i) future stock splits, which may increase the liquidity of our shares; (ii) the sale of stock to obtain additional capital or to acquire other companies or businesses, which could enhance our growth strategy or allow us to reduce debt if needed; and (iii) for other bona fide purposes. Our Board may authorize us to issue the available authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock without notice to, or further action by, our stockholders, unless stockholder approval is required by law or the rules of the OTCQX.\nThe issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or new shares of Preferred Stock, convertible securities, and/or warrants may significantly dilute the equity ownership of the current holders of our Common Stock, affect the rights of our stockholders, or could reduce the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, the issuance or sale of large amounts of our Common Stock, or the potential for issuance or sale even if they do not actually occur, may have the effect of depressing the market price of our Common Stock.\nD4.\nShares eligible for future sale pursuant to Rule 144 may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of Common Stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, stockholders who have been non-affiliates for the preceding three months may sell shares of our Common Stock freely after six months subject only to the current public information requirement. Affiliates may sell shares of our Common Stock after six months subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale, current public information, and notice requirements. Any substantial sales of our Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144 may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 28\nD5.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore investors should not anticipate cash dividends on their investment.\nUnder certain of our secured loan agreements, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend on our Common Stock without the prior written consent of the lender. We have historically not declared any dividends on our Common Stock and there can be no assurance that cash dividends will ever be paid on our Common Stock.\nD6.\nWe do not currently have a chief financial officer; and failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could result in material weaknesses in our internal controls and have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. Jonathan Carroll, our Chief Executive Officer, also serves as our principal financial and principal accounting officer. Although we review our internal controls over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with Section 404 requirements, having a chief financial officer would reduce the likelihood of errors related to the recording, disclosure, and presentation of consolidated financial information in quarterly, annual, and other filings. Material weaknesses could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which ultimately could negatively impact our stock price.\nThere are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any control system, including the potential for human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures. Additionally, judgments in decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. An effective control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control objectives of the system are adequately met. Accordingly, management does not expect that the control system can prevent or detect all errors or fraud. Further, projections of any evaluation or assessment of effectiveness of a control system to future periods are subject to the risks that, over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in an entity\u2019s operating environment or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\nAs previously reported, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, management\u2019s evaluation of our internal controls determined they were ineffective because there was not a process in place for formal review of manual journal entries. In addition, we lacked resources to handle complex accounting transactions. Management took steps during 2020 and 2021 to remediate the identified deficiencies. As a result, for the twelve months ended December 31,2021, management\u2019s evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting determined they were effective.\nRemainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31, 2021 \u2502Page 29", "PERMNO": 76310, "SIC": 4922, "TIC": "BDCO"}
