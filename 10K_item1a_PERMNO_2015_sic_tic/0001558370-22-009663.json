RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors\nOur business faces significant risks and uncertainties. Certain important factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC.\nOperations and Infrastructure Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the U.S. and world. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain due to evolving factors, such as the resurgence of the COVID-19 virus and the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, and administration of effective treatments and vaccines, global economic conditions, and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic. Governments have taken and may in the future take various measures in response to COVID-19, including mandating the closure of certain businesses and limiting in-store traffic.\nOur stores and distribution centers are open and operational, however, any future governmental mandates or illness or absence of a substantial number of employees could require that we temporarily close one or more of our stores and/or distribution centers. We have experienced and may experience in the future, disruptions in store operations, including the temporary closure of certain stores to in-store traffic and the shift to contactless curbside click and pick-up service and limited in-store appointments at select stores. Additionally, the temporary closure of a distribution center would complicate or prevent our fulfilling of online orders, and disrupt the operations of our stores by preventing our ability to supply merchandise to our stores. We will continue to review local, state and federal mandates related to COVID-19, which may require us to adjust our operations in response to revised governmental mandates. There can be no assurance that the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic will not materially impact our future business operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not be required by landlords or authorities at the local, state or federal level to close some or all of our stores again in the future, or as to how long any such closure would last. In general, during any such closure, we would still be obligated to make payments to landlords and for routine operating costs, such as utilities and insurance. Should there be further widespread store disruptions in the future due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash flows from operations or other sources of liquidity to continue making such payments when due, or that efforts to reduce, offset or defer such obligations, such as entering into deferral agreements with landlords or other creditors, will be successful. During fiscal 2020, the Company renegotiated terms with landlords as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the deferral of approximately $11.9 million of certain cash lease payments, which was repaid as of April 2, 2022.\nOur business requires that we lease substantial amounts of space and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to lease space on terms as favorable as the leases negotiated in the past.\nWe do not own any real estate at our TCS segment. Instead, we lease all of our store locations, as well as our corporate headquarters and distribution center in Coppell, Texas, our second distribution center in Aberdeen, Maryland, and the Closet Works manufacturing facility in Elmhurst, Illinois. Our stores are leased from third parties and generally have an initial term of 10 to 15 years. Many of our lease agreements also have additional five-year renewal options and certain leases have early cancellation clauses, which permit the lease to be terminated by us or the landlord if certain sales levels are not met in specific periods or if the shopping venue does not meet specified occupancy standards. In addition to fixed minimum lease payments, most of our store leases provide for additional lease payments based on a percentage of sales, or \u201cpercentage rent,\u201d if sales at the respective stores exceed specified levels, as well as the payment of common area maintenance charges, real property insurance and real estate taxes. Many of our lease agreements have\ndefined escalating lease payment provisions over the initial term and any extensions. Increases in our already substantial occupancy costs and difficulty in identifying economically suitable new store locations could have significant negative consequences, which include:\n\u25cf requiring that a greater portion of our available cash be applied to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes and reducing our operating profitability;\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u25cf limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business or the industry in which we compete.\nAdditional sites that we lease may be subject to long-term non-cancelable leases if we are unable to negotiate our current standard lease terms. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under that lease. In addition, if we are not able to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCosts and risks relating to new store openings could severely limit our growth opportunities.\nPart of our growth strategy depends on opening stores in new and existing markets. We must successfully choose store sites, execute favorable real estate transactions on terms that are acceptable to us, hire competent personnel and effectively open and operate these new stores. Our plans to increase our number of retail stores will depend in part on the availability of existing retail stores or store sites. A lack of available financing on terms acceptable to real estate developers, or a tightening credit market, may adversely affect the number or quality of retail sites available to us. We cannot assure you that stores or sites will be available to us, or that they will be available on terms acceptable to us. If additional retail store sites are unavailable on acceptable terms, we may not be able to carry out a significant part of our growth strategy.\nOur operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal fluctuations, and results for any quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nOur quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future, depending upon a variety of factors, including our product offerings, promotional events, store openings, the weather, remodeling or relocations, shifts in the timing of holidays, timing of catalog releases or sales, timing of delivery of orders, competitive factors and general economic conditions, including economic downturns as a result of unforeseen events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and supply chain disruptions, among other things, and may fluctuate significantly in the future. As a result of these factors, the demands on our product distribution and delivery network may fluctuate during the fiscal year. Accordingly, our results of operations may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and relative to corresponding periods in prior years. In fiscal 2021, sales and profitability did not follow historical patterns due to various factors, including changes in promotional strategy and cadence. In addition, we may take certain pricing or marketing actions that could have a disproportionate effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in a particular quarter or selling season. These initiatives may disproportionately impact results in a particular quarter and we believe that comparisons of our operating results from period to period are not necessarily meaningful and cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.\nWe have acquired Closet Works, and may in the future acquire other businesses, which can divert management\u2019s attention and create integration risks and other risks for our business.\nIn December 2021, we completed the acquisition of Closet Works, and we expect that we may continue to pursue future acquisitions. Such acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf integrating the operations, systems, technologies, services and personnel of the acquired companies, including the migration of employees from an acquired company\u2019s platforms to ours;\n\u25cf establishing or maintaining internal controls, procedures and policies relating to the acquired business, including the potential for actual or perceived control weaknesses associated with or arising from the acquisitions and integration of such business;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and may not succeed;\n\u25cf impairment of relationships with customers and employees of the acquired companies or our customers and employees as a result of the integration of acquired operations and new management personnel;\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u25cf litigation resulting from activities of the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders and other third parties;\n\u25cf over-valuing and over-paying for acquisitions;\n\u25cf insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisitions and unanticipated liabilities of the acquired companies; and\n\u25cf insufficient indemnification or security from the selling parties for legal liabilities that we may assume in connection with our acquisitions.\nIf we fail to integrate Closet Works or any other newly acquired business effectively, we might not achieve the growth, service enhancement or operational efficiency objectives of the acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur costs may increase due to factors that may or may not be controllable by us, which may negatively affect our financial results.\nIncreases in our costs that are beyond our control, including items such as increases in commodity prices for raw materials that are directly or indirectly related to the production and distribution of our products, such as the prices of steel, oil, resin and pulp, increases in fuel and transportation costs, including shipping surcharges, higher interest rates, increases in losses from damaged merchandise, inflation, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, higher costs of labor, labor disputes around the world, increases in the costs of insurance and healthcare, including the potential for increased insurance premiums, medical claim costs and worker\u2019s compensation claim costs and increased incremental costs of doing business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in postage and media costs, higher tax rates, and the cost of compliance with changes in laws and regulations, including accounting standards, may negatively impact our financial results. In addition to general levels of inflation that we have experienced, we are also subject to risk of specific inflationary pressures on product prices due to, for example, the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, related global supply chain disruptions, and the uncertain economic and geopolitical environment. If inflation continues to increase, we may not be able to adjust prices sufficiently to offset the effect without negatively impacting consumer demand or our gross margin.\nInformation Technology Risks\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our online sales, our reputation and operating results may be harmed.\nWe sell merchandise over the Internet through our website, containerstore.com, and through mobile applications for smart phones and tablets. In fiscal 2021, our website and mobile applications accounted for approximately 21% of TCS net sales.\nWe are vulnerable to certain risks and uncertainties associated with our e-commerce websites, including: changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures, costs and technical issues for upgrades of our website software, computer viruses, changes in applicable federal and state regulations, security breaches, and consumer privacy concerns. The failure of our website or mobile applications to perform as expected could result in disruptions and additional costs to our operations and make it more difficult for customers to purchase merchandise online, which could adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.\nA cyber-attack or security incident impacting our or our third-party providers\u2019 information technology systems or confidential information could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to regulatory or litigation risk and materially affect our business, financial results, results of operations, as well as the trading price of our common stock.\nIn conducting our business, including our e-commerce business, we rely heavily on computer systems, hardware, software, technology infrastructure and online websites and networks (collectively, \u201cIT Systems\u201d) for both internal and external operations. We manage some of these IT Systems, but also rely on third-parties for a range of IT Systems and related products and services. In addition, we and certain of our third-party providers collect, transmit and maintain data about our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personal information, as well as proprietary and other confidential information (collectively, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d).\nWe have committed financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security policies, procedures and measures that are designed to protect our IT Systems and Confidential Information. As a result, we currently incur significant costs in connection with efforts such as network security, disaster recovery, and employee training, and may incur significant costs to change our business practices or modify our service offerings in connection with the protection of Confidential Information. However, there are no guarantees that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all cyberattacks or system disruptions. We, like many companies, have experienced cyberattacks, system vulnerabilities and security incidents in the past. While we are not aware of any material disruptions or incidents to date, we cannot assure that any breaches, attacks or unauthorized disclosures will not occur in the future, including attacks or incidents that may materially impact our business. Cyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis and threat actors are increasingly sophisticated in using techniques that are designed to circumvent security controls, evade detection, and remove forensic evidence. As a result, we and our third-party providers may be unable to anticipate, prevent, detect, investigate, contain or recover from future attacks and incidents in a timely or effective manner.\nDespite the security measures that we and many of our third-party providers have implemented, our IT Systems may be disrupted or damaged and Confidential Information may be compromised, corrupted, lost or stolen. This may occur as a result of targeted attacks by state-sponsored actors or due to an array of tools and techniques utilized by cybercriminals, for example, the deployment of viruses or malware (such as ransomware), denial-of-service attacks, break-ins, and social engineering attacks (such as phishing exploits), as well as inadvertent errors committed by employees, contractors or other parties, and hardware or software bugs, misconfigurations or similar vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks, security incidents, and similar events could result in any or all of the following: unauthorized access to or disruption to our IT Systems and operations; unauthorized modification or disclosure of Confidential Information; governmental and regulatory inquiries, investigations, fines and penalties; litigation, including but not limited to class actions, pursuant to enacted and developing laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which provides for a private rights of action and statutory damages in connection with certain types of data breaches; loss of confidence in our Company, negative media coverage, and brand and reputational harm; loss of customers and business opportunities; increased costs to investigate, contain, restore or remediate IT Systems; and a range of other costs and\nliabilities. Any or all of the foregoing may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as the trading price of our stock.\nWhile we maintain insurance related to cybersecurity and privacy risk, there is no guarantee that all costs and liabilities would be recovered or reimbursed, or that insurance will continue to be available to us at all or on economically reasonable terms.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and consumer protection, or the expansion of current, or the enactment of new, laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nWe collect, use, store, share and otherwise process different types of personal information that relates to a range of individuals, including our customers, website visitors, employees, job applicants, alumni and employees of other companies that we do business with (such as our vendors, suppliers and business partners). We are subject to a variety of international, federal and state and local laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, consumer protection, and our handling of this information. There is no harmonized approach to data privacy or protection laws and regulations. Consequently, we increase our risk of non-compliance with applicable data privacy and protection laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business. We may need to change and limit the way we use personal information in operating our business and may have difficulty maintaining a single operating model that is compliant. Further, many of these laws may require consent from consumers for the use of data for various purposes, including marketing, which may reduce our ability to market our products. Compliance with such laws and regulations will result in additional costs and may necessitate changes to our business practices and divergent operating models, which may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and many state Attorneys General are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of personal information, including statements that we make in our privacy policies. There are also federal laws covering our marketing activities, such as the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (known as the \u201cCAN-SPAM\u201d Act) and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (as implemented by the Telemarketing Sales Rule) (\u201cTCPA\u201d). In addition, we are subject to various state privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which came into effect in January of 2020, and the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which will expand upon the CCPA and go into effect in January 2023 (with a lookback period until January 2022). The CCPA requires (and the CPRA will require) covered companies to, among other things, provide new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers certain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain security breaches that may increase security breach litigation. The CPRA imposes additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses and disclosure of sensitive personal information. It also creates a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection enforcement. The majority of the CPRA provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023 (with a lookback to January 2022), and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. The CCPA and CPRA have encouraged \u201ccopycat\u201d laws in other states across the United States. For example, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (\u201cVCDPA\u201d) in 2021, another comprehensive state privacy law, which will also be effective on January 1, 2023. Also in 2021, Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act (\u201cCPA\u201d), which goes into effect July 1, 2023. Most recently, Utah enacted the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cUCPA\u201d) in March 2022, which goes into effect on December 31, 2023. Similar laws have been proposed, and likely will be proposed, in other states and at the federal level, and if passed, such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging.\nWe cannot predict the impact of these laws, or subsequent guidance, but these laws and regulations are complex and rapidly evolving, subject to potentially differing interpretations and likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. As a result, our practices may not comply, or may not comply in the future, with all such laws, regulations, requirements, and obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any federal, state, or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection could have a\nmaterially adverse impact to our reputation, brand, and business, and may result in claims, proceedings, or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities or require us to change our operations, incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply, modify our data processing practices and policies, or cease using certain data sets. Any such claim, proceeding, or action, including a complaint by an activist to a regulatory authority or other public statement criticizing our practices, could hurt our reputation, brand, and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of customers and vendors, result in the imposition of monetary penalties, and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless certain third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations, or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection or any inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business.\nFinally, there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to operate our business in accordance with the Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) Data Security Standards or other industry recommended practices that relate to payment processing, including in relation to our ecommerce operations. We intend to maintain compliance with PCI Data Security Standards and will incur additional expenses to maintain PCI compliance. Even if we are compliant with such standards, we still may be vulnerable and unable to prevent security breaches involving customer transaction data.\nWe rely upon third-party service providers to operate many critical aspects of our internal and external business operations and any disruption of or interference with such operations, or material non-compliance with laws and regulations by such third parties, could materially and adversely impact our business.\nWe rely on many third-parties for critical internal and external operations. For example, third-party web service providers provide a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a \u201ccloud\u201d computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities, and other services provided by these third-party providers. Any disruption of or interference with our use of third-party service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, other third-party providers assist us with employee benefits processing, payment processing and security monitoring, among many other activities, on behalf of the company. Material non-compliance with privacy, security or consumer protection laws by these third parties may jeopardize our ability to obtain or offer core products and services, expose us to regulatory investigations and litigation, and materially impact our business and financial results.\nMaterial damage to, or interruptions in, our information systems as a result of external factors, working from home arrangements, staffing shortages and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon IT Systems in the conduct of all aspects of our operations. Such IT Systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, slowness due to strain on internet connectivity due to employees working from home, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, fire and natural disasters. Damage or interruption to our IT Systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased cybersecurity risk as a result of global remote working dynamics that present additional opportunities for threat actors to engage in social engineering (for example, phishing) and to exploit vulnerabilities in non-corporate networks used by many of our employees as well as those of critical third-party providers. Any material interruptions or failures in our IT systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe also rely on our information technology staff. If we cannot meet our staffing needs in this area, we may not be able to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems.\nWe rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many IT Systems so that they can continue to support our business. The software programs supporting many of our IT Systems were licensed to us by independent software developers. The inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these IT\nSystems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner.\nWe are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our website, including changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures, costs and technical issues as we upgrade our website software, computer viruses, changes in applicable federal and state regulation, security breaches, legal claims related to our website operations and e-commerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nSupply Chain Risks\nOur facilities and systems, as well as those of our vendors, are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected events, and as a result we may lose merchandise, incur unexpected costs or be unable to effectively service our stores and online customers.\nOur retail stores, corporate office, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, infrastructure projects and direct-to-customer operations, as well as the operations of our vendors from which we receive goods and services, are vulnerable to damage from various natural disasters including earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods, as well as other unexpected events, such as pandemics, climate change, geopolitical and civil unrest, power losses, telecommunications failures, hardware and software failures, computer viruses and similar events. If any of these events results in damage to our facilities or systems, or those of our vendors, we may experience interruptions in our business until the damage is repaired, resulting in the potential loss of customers and revenues. In addition, we may incur costs in deductibles and repairing any damage beyond our applicable insurance coverage.\nMaterial disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact production, customer deliveries and overall financial results.\nElfa operates three manufacturing facilities: two in Sweden and one in Poland. As a part of the December 2021 acquisition of Closet Works, we added a manufacturing facility in Elmhurst, Illinois to supply our custom closets. A material operational disruption in one of our manufacturing facilities could occur as a result of any number of events including, but not limited to, major equipment failures, labor stoppages, temporary or permanent factory closings, transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods, severe weather conditions, climate change, health epidemics or pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which could result in limitations on the ability to travel and return to work, geopolitical and civil unrest and disruptions in utility services. Such a disruption could negatively impact production, customer deliveries and financial results.\nOur ability to obtain merchandise on a timely basis at competitive prices could suffer as a result of any deterioration or change in our vendor relationships or events that adversely affect our vendors or their ability to obtain financing for their operations, including COVID-19.\nWe believe our vendor relationships are critical to our success. We do not have long-term contracts with any of our vendors and we generally transact business on an order-by-order basis, operating without any contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products. Any of our vendors could discontinue supplying us with desired products in sufficient quantities for a variety of reasons. If we are unable to acquire suitable merchandise in sufficient quantities, at acceptable prices with adequate delivery times due to the loss of or a deterioration or change in our relationship with one or more of our key vendors or events harmful to our vendors occur, it may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe benefits we currently experience from our vendor relationships could be adversely affected if our vendors:\n\u25cf discontinue selling merchandise to us;\n\u25cf enter into exclusivity arrangements with our competitors;\n\u25cf sell similar merchandise to our competitors with similar or better pricing, many of whom already purchase merchandise in significantly greater volume and, in some cases, at lower prices than we do;\n\u25cf raise the prices they charge us;\n\u25cf change payment terms to require us to pay on delivery or upfront, including as a result of changes in the credit relationships some of our vendors have with their various lending institutions;\n\u25cf lengthen their lead times; or\n\u25cf initiate or expand sales of storage and organization products to retail customers directly through their own stores, catalogs or on the internet.\nWe historically have established excellent working relationships with many small- to mid-size vendors that generally have more limited resources, production capacities and operating histories. Adverse market and economic events, such as the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical and civil unrest, and climate change, could impair our ability to obtain merchandise in sufficient quantities from these vendors. Such events include difficulties or problems associated with our vendors' business, finances, labor, ability to export or import, production, insurance and reputation, which our vendors are currently facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on acceptable terms or at all in the future, especially if we need significantly greater amounts of inventory in connection with the growth of our business. We may need to develop new relationships with larger vendors, and we may not be able to find similar merchandise with the same terms from larger vendors. The receipt of products sourced from areas impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic has been and may continue to be slowed or disrupted, which could further impact our ability to merchandise in sufficient quantities.\nProduct recalls and/or product liability, as well as changes in product safety and other consumer protection laws, may adversely impact our merchandise offerings, reputation, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe are subject to regulations by a variety of federal, state and international regulatory authorities, including the Consumer Product Safety Commission. During fiscal 2021, we purchased merchandise from approximately 630 vendors. If our vendors fail to manufacture or import merchandise that adheres to product safety requirements or our quality control standards, our reputation and brands could be damaged, potentially leading to increases in customer litigation against us. It is possible that one or more of our vendors might not adhere to product safety requirements or our quality control standards, and we might not identify the deficiency before merchandise is sold. Any issues of product safety could cause us to recall some of those products. If our vendors are unable or unwilling to recall products failing to meet product safety requirements or our quality standards, we may be required to recall those products at a substantial cost to us. Furthermore, to the extent we are unable to replace any recalled products, we may have to reduce our merchandise offerings, resulting in a decrease in sales, especially if a recall occurs near a seasonal period.\nMoreover, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs to us for certain merchandise, and additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. Our vendors may require long lead times on merchandise ordering cycles, which could increase the difficulty for us to plan and prepare for potential changes to applicable consumer protection laws. In particular, The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 imposes significant requirements on manufacturing, importing, testing and labeling requirements for some of our products. In the event that we are unable to timely comply with regulatory changes, significant fines or penalties could result, and could adversely affect our merchandise offerings, reputation, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe face risks related to operating two distribution centers and our manufacturing facilities.\nOur business depends upon the successful operation of our distribution centers and manufacturing facilities, as well as our ability to fulfill orders and to deliver our merchandise to our customers in a timely manner. We currently handle merchandise distribution for all of our stores from two facilities, one in Coppell, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, Texas,\nand the second in Aberdeen, Maryland. We also supply custom closets from the Closet Works manufacturing facility in Elmhurst, Illinois. We use independent third-party transportation companies as well as leased trucks to deliver our merchandise to our stores and our customers. Any significant interruption in the operation of our distribution centers or the domestic transportation infrastructure due to natural disasters, accidents, inclement weather, system failures, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes by employees of the transportation companies, temporary or government-mandated closures, or other causes, including health epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores, which could result in lower sales, a loss of loyalty to our brands and excess inventory and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to duties, tariffs and quotas associated with our dependence on foreign imports for our merchandise.\nDuring fiscal 2021, including purchases for Elfa which represented approximately 19% of our purchases, we purchased approximately 57% of our merchandise from vendors located outside the United States (including approximately 34% from vendors located in China) and approximately 43% of our merchandise from vendors located in the United States. In addition, some of the merchandise we purchase from vendors in the United States also depends, in whole or in part, on manufacturers located outside the United States. As a result, our business depends on global trade, as well as trade and cost factors that impact the specific countries where our vendors are located, including Asia. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to maintain our existing foreign vendor relationships and to develop new ones. While we rely on our long-term relationships with our foreign vendors, we have no long-term contracts with them and transact business on an order by order basis.\nMany of our imported products are subject to existing duties, tariffs and quotas that may limit the quantity of some types of goods that we may import into the United States. Because a large portion of our merchandise is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the United States, major changes in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of income tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity and net income. For example, in recent years, tariffs were imposed on many items sourced to the U.S. from China, including products and raw materials imported into the U.S., and the Chinese government has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. manufactured goods. As a result, we continually evaluate the impact of enacted tariffs, along with any potential additional tariffs or retaliatory trade restrictions implemented by other countries. These tariffs could adversely affect our customer sales by causing potential delays in product received from our vendors, cost of goods sold and results of operations. We may not be able to fully or substantially mitigate the impact of such tariffs, pass price increases on to our customers, or secure adequate alternative sources of products or materials.\nOur dependence on foreign imports also makes us vulnerable to risks associated with products manufactured abroad, including, among other things, risks of damage, destruction or confiscation of products while in transit to our distribution centers located in the United States, charges on or assessment of additional import duties, surcharges, tariffs and quotas, loss of \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status by the United States in relation to a particular foreign country, work stoppages, including without limitation as a result of events such as longshoremen strikes, transportation and other delays in shipments, including without limitation as a result of heightened security screening and inspection processes or other port-of-entry limitations or restrictions in the United States, freight cost increases, health epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, and economic uncertainties, including inflation, foreign government regulations, trade restrictions, including the United States retaliating against protectionist foreign trade practices and geopolitical unrest, increased labor costs and other similar factors that might affect the operations of our manufacturers in specific countries such as China.\nAn interruption or delay in supply from our foreign sources, or the imposition of additional duties, surcharges, taxes or other charges on these imports, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements are secured.\nIn addition, there is a risk that compliance lapses by our manufacturers could occur, which could lead to investigations by U.S. government agencies responsible for international trade compliance. Resulting penalties or enforcement actions could delay future imports/exports or otherwise negatively impact our business. In addition, there remains a risk that one or more of our foreign manufacturers will not adhere to applicable legal requirements or our\nglobal compliance standards such as fair labor standards, the prohibition on child labor and other product safety or manufacturing safety standards. The violation of applicable legal requirements, including labor, manufacturing and safety laws, by any of our manufacturers, the failure of any of our manufacturers to adhere to our global compliance standards or the divergence of the labor practices followed by any of our manufacturers from those generally accepted in the United States, could disrupt our supply of products from our manufacturers or the shipment of products to us, result in potential liability to us and harm our reputation and brand, any of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely upon independent third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments and are subject to increased shipping costs as well as the potential inability of our third-party transportation providers to deliver on a timely basis.\nWe rely upon independent third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from all of our stores. Our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which has in the past, and could continue to increase our shipping costs, and employee strikes and inclement weather, health epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, which has impacted and may continue to impact a shipping company\u2019s ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. In fiscal 2021, gross margin was negatively affected by increased freight costs, and we could continue to see a negative impact on gross margin in fiscal 2022. Our reputation for providing a high level of customer service is dependent on such third-party transportation providers to timely deliver our products. If we change the shipping companies we use, we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries and we would incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those received from our current independent third-party transportation providers, which in turn would increase our costs.\nConsumer Behavior Risks\nAn overall decline in the health of the economy and consumer spending may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items, which could reduce demand for our products and materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.\nOur business depends on consumer demand for our products and, consequently, is sensitive to a number of factors that influence general consumer spending on discretionary items in particular. Factors influencing consumer spending include general economic conditions, consumer disposable income, fuel prices, recession and fears of recession, unemployment, war and fears of war, inclement weather, availability of consumer credit, consumer debt levels, conditions in the housing market, interest rates, sales tax rates and rate increases, inflation, consumer confidence in future economic and political conditions, and consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security, including health epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Prolonged or pervasive economic downturns could slow the pace of new store openings or cause current stores to temporarily or permanently close. Adverse changes in factors affecting discretionary consumer spending have reduced and may continue to further reduce consumer demand for our products, thus reducing our sales and harming our business and operating results.\nIf we are unable to source and market new products to meet our high standards and customer preferences or are unable to offer our customers an aesthetically pleasing and convenient shopping environment, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to source and market new products that both meet our standards for quality and appeal to customers\u2019 preferences. Our buying team is primarily responsible for both sourcing products that meet our high specifications and identifying and responding to changing customer preferences. Failure to source and market such products, or to accurately forecast changing customer preferences, could lead to a decrease in the number of customer transactions at our stores and a decrease in the amount customers spend when they visit our stores. In addition, the sourcing of our products is dependent, in part, on our relationships with our vendors. If we are unable to maintain these relationships, we may not be able to continue to source products at competitive prices that both meet our standards and appeal to our customers.\nWe also attempt to create an aesthetically pleasing and convenient shopping experience, including on our website. If we are not successful in creating an aesthetically pleasing and convenient shopping experience, we may lose customers or fail to obtain new customers.\nIf we do not succeed in introducing and sourcing new products that consumers want to buy or maintaining good relationships with our vendors, or are unable to provide an aesthetically pleasing and convenient shopping environment or maintain our level of customer service, our sales, operating margins and market share may decrease, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to anticipate consumer preferences and demand, or to manage inventory commensurate with demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to identify, originate and define storage and organization product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. Our products must appeal to a range of consumers whose preferences cannot always be predicted with certainty. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop products that customers respond to positively or that we will successfully meet consumer demands in the future. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify or respond effectively to consumer preferences and demand could adversely affect sales of our products. If this occurs, our sales may decline, and we may be required to mark down certain products to sell the resulting excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we must manage our merchandise in stock and inventory levels to track consumer demand. Much of our merchandise requires that we provide vendors with significant ordering lead time, frequently before market factors are known. In addition, the nature of our products requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory prior to peak selling seasons. If we are not able to anticipate consumer demand for our different product offerings, or successfully manage inventory levels for products that are in demand, we may experience and have experienced:\n\u25cf back orders, order cancellations and lost sales for products that are in high demand for which we did not stock adequate inventory; and\n\u25cf overstock inventory levels for products that have lower consumer demand, requiring us to take markdowns or other steps to sell slower moving merchandise.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to misjudgments in the selection and timing of merchandise purchases.\nNew stores in new markets, where we are less familiar with the target customer and less well-known, may face different or additional risks and increased costs compared to stores operated in existing markets or new stores in existing markets.\nCompetition Risks\nCompetition, including internet-based competition, could negatively impact our business, adversely affecting our ability to generate higher net sales.\nThe retail industry is highly competitive, with few barriers to entry. Competition is characterized by many factors, including level of service, merchandise assortment, product quality, price, location, reputation, credit availability, and customer loyalty. A variety of retailers offer products that are similar to the products we offer in our stores and through our website. Competitive products can be found in mass merchants, as well as specialty retail chains. Some of our competitors, particularly the mass merchants, are larger and have greater financial resources than we do.\nWe also face competition from other internet-based retailers, and traditional store-based retailers. This results in increased price competition and customer selection of similar products.\nIn addition, we must successfully respond to changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to e-commerce usage. We may need to purchase new or improved technology, creative user interfaces and other e-commerce marketing tools such as paid search and mobile applications, among others. This may result in increased costs and may not succeed in increasing sales or attracting customers. Our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than we do, may also be able to benefit from changes in e-commerce technologies, which could harm our competitive position. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\nOur vendors may sell similar or identical products to our competitors, which could harm our business.\nAlthough we have negotiated North-American exclusivity on many of the products we sell in our stores, a majority of our non-elfa\u00ae product sales are not exclusive. These vendors could sell similar or identical products to our competitors, some of whom purchase products in significantly greater volume, or enter into exclusive arrangements with other retailers that could limit our access to their products. Our vendors could also initiate or expand sales of their products through their own stores or through the Internet to the retail market and therefore compete with us directly or sell their products through outlet centers or discount stores, increasing the competitive pricing pressure we face.\nBrand Reputation Risks\nOur business depends in part on a strong brand image. If we are not able to protect our brand, we may be unable to attract a sufficient number of customers or sell sufficient quantities of our products.\nWe believe that the brand image we have developed has contributed significantly to the success of our business to date. We also believe that protecting The Container Store brand is integral to our business and to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Our brand image may be diminished if we do not continue to make investments in areas such as marketing and advertising, as well as the day-to-day investments required for store operations, catalog mailings, online sales and employee training. Our brand image may be further diminished if new products fail to maintain or enhance our distinctive brand image. Furthermore, our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality, if we fail to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities, if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations or if we experience negative publicity or other negative events that affect our image or reputation, some of which may be beyond our ability to control. While we work with a third-party audit vendor to ensure a responsible and ethical supply chain, if any of our vendors engage in environmental, workplace or human rights violations that we are unable to identify or remediate, our business could be negatively affected and our brand could be harmed. In addition, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation. Any failure to maintain a strong brand image could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nOur failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our competitive position.\nWe attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and in foreign countries, through a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, trade dress and unfair competition laws, as well as confidentiality procedures, and assignment and licensing arrangements. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors or other third parties will not infringe upon our intellectual property rights, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our intellectual property rights by other parties in such countries and our competitive position may suffer.\nLiquidity Risks\nWe face risks related to our indebtedness, that could result in a high degree of leverage on cash flow from operations to pay back debt.\nAs of April 2, 2022, we had total outstanding debt of $169.5 million and an additional $106.8 million of availability under our asset-based revolving credit agreement (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) and the 2019 Elfa revolving credit facilities (the \u201c2019 Elfa Revolving Facilities\u201d). Our senior secured term loan facility with JPMorgan Chase bank, N.A. (the \u201cSenior Secured Term Loan Facility\u201d), which matures January 31, 2026, represented $167.5 million of the total outstanding debt.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our leverage could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u25cf exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as our borrowings under our current debt facilities are at variable rates;\n\u25cf making it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt;\n\u25cf limiting our ability to pay future dividends;\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the storage and organization retail industry or the general economy and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u25cf requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\n\u25cf restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u25cf requiring us to comply with financial and operational covenants as well as leverage covenants, restricting us, among other things, from placing liens on our assets, making investments, incurring debt, making payments to our equity or debt holders and engaging in transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u25cf preventing us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise or successfully carrying out our plans to expand our store base and product offerings; and\n\u25cf placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less leveraged.\nConsequences of this indebtedness may require a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we would be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. A failure by us or our subsidiaries to comply with the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under such indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable and exercise other remedies as set forth in the agreements. If any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that\nour assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nOur costs and financial results may change as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nDuring fiscal 2021, approximately 79% of our merchandise, based on cost of merchandise purchased, was manufactured abroad. The prices charged by foreign manufacturers may be affected by the fluctuation of their local currency against the U.S. dollar. We source goods from various countries, including China, and thus changes in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies may affect the costs of goods that we purchase.\nOur largest exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations is between the U.S. dollar and Swedish krona. All purchases from the Elfa segment by the TCS segment are in Swedish krona. Approximately 16% of our U.S. dollar merchandise purchases in the TCS segment in fiscal 2021 were originally made in Swedish krona from our Elfa segment. Additionally, all assets and liabilities of our Elfa segment are translated at year end rates of exchange, with the exception of certain assets and liabilities that are translated at historical rates of exchange. Revenues, expenses, and cash flows of our Elfa segment are translated at average rates of exchange for the year. As a result, our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the Swedish krona as compared to the U.S. dollar. Based on the average exchange rate from Swedish krona to U.S. dollar during fiscal 2021, and results of operations in functional currency, we believe that a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate of the Swedish krona would increase or decrease net income by approximately $0.6 million.\nWe will require significant capital to fund our expanding business, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all. If we are unable to maintain sufficient levels of operating cash flows, we may require additional financing which could adversely affect our financial health and impose covenants that limit our business activities.\nWe primarily depend on cash flow from operations, the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined above), and the 2019 Elfa Revolving Facilities (as defined above), to fund our business and growth plans. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund these activities, we may need additional equity or debt financing. If such financing is not available to us, or is not available on satisfactory terms, our ability to operate and expand our business or respond to competitive pressures would be curtailed and we may need to delay, limit or eliminate planned store openings or operations or other elements of our growth strategy. If we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, your ownership would be diluted.\nOur fixed lease obligations could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur fixed lease obligations will require us to use a significant portion of cash generated by our operations to satisfy these obligations, and could adversely impact our ability to obtain future financing to support our growth or other operational investments. We will require substantial cash flows from operations to make our payments under our operating leases, many of which provide for periodic increases in operating lease expense. If we are not able to make the required payments under the leases, the lenders or owners of the stores may, among other things, repossess those assets, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations. In addition, our failure to make payments under our operating leases could trigger defaults under other leases or under agreements governing our indebtedness, which could cause the counterparties under those agreements to accelerate the obligations due thereunder.\nDisruptions in the global financial markets and rising interest rates may make it difficult for us to borrow a sufficient amount of capital to finance the carrying costs of inventory and to pay for capital expenditures and operating costs, which could negatively affect our business.\nDisruptions in the global financial markets and rising interest rates and banking systems have made credit and capital markets more difficult for companies to access, even for some companies with established revolving or other credit facilities. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, each member of the syndicate for the Revolving Credit Facility is responsible for providing a portion of the loans to be made under the facility. Factors that have previously affected our borrowing ability under the Revolving Credit Facility have included the borrowing base formula limitations, adjustments in the appraised value of our inventory used to calculate the borrowing base and the availability of each of the lenders to\nadvance its portion of requested borrowing drawdowns under the facility. If, in connection with a disruption in the global financial markets or otherwise, any participant, or group of participants, with a significant portion of the commitments in the Revolving Credit Facility fails to satisfy its obligations to extend credit under the facility and we are unable to find a replacement for such participant or group of participants on a timely basis (if at all), our liquidity and our business may be materially adversely affected.\nChanges to global financial markets, including the use of benchmark interest rates, may make it difficult for us to predict our future interest expenses.\nIn March 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer require panel banks to submit quotes for LIBOR settings other than overnight and 12-month U.S. dollar LIBOR after December 31, 2021, and will no longer require panel banks to submit quotes for any U.S. dollar LIBOR settings after June 30, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the\u202fAlternative Reference Rates\u202fCommittee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering\u202freplacing\u202fLIBOR\u202fwith the\u202fSecured Overnight Financing Rate, or \u201cSOFR\u201d, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities, and U.S. regulators have issued supervisory guidance encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate. Working groups formed by financial regulators in other jurisdictions, including the U.K., the European Union, Japan and Switzerland, have also recommended alternatives to LIBOR denominated in their local currencies. Although SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for USD LIBOR, it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted outside of the United States. At this time, it is not possible to definitively predict the effect of any changes to\u202fLIBOR\u202for any establishment of\u202falternative\u202fbenchmark\u202frates, including\u202fSOFR. Our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility provide that in the event LIBOR rates are no longer available, we and our lenders will negotiate in good faith to adopt a replacement benchmark rate and an applicable margin for borrowings based on such replacement benchmark rate. We may incur increased interest expense using any such replacement benchmark rates, which could have an adverse effect on us, including our costs of funds, access to capital markets and financial results.\nHuman Resources Risks\nWe depend on key executive management.\nWe depend on the leadership and experience of our key executive management. The loss of the services of any of our executive management members, whether in a planned transition or otherwise, could also disrupt our business. As there is a high level of competition for experienced, successful personnel in the retail industry, we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace departing personnel on a timely basis or without incurring increased costs, or at all. We do not maintain key-man life insurance policies on any of our executive officers. We believe that our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. Our inability to meet our staffing requirements in the future could impair our growth and harm our business.\nIf we are unable to find, train and retain key personnel, including new employees that reflect our brand image and embody our culture, we may not be able to grow or sustain our operations.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of store employees, including general managers and store managers, who understand and appreciate our customers, products, brand and corporate culture, and are able to adequately and effectively represent our culture and establish credibility with our customers. If we are unable to attract, train and retain employees in the future, we may not be able to serve our customers effectively, thus reducing our ability to continue our growth and to operate our existing stores as profitably as we have in the past. We hire personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture, understanding of our customers and knowledge of the merchandise we offer. There is a high level of competition for experienced, qualified personnel in the retail industry and we compete for personnel with a variety of companies looking to hire for retail positions. Our growth plans could strain our ability to staff our new stores, particularly at the store manager level, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain a cohesive and consistently strong team, which in turn could have an adverse impact on our business performance and brand image.\nOrganized labor activities could cause labor relation issues and higher labor costs.\nAs of April 2, 2022, approximately 60% of Elfa\u2019s employees (approximately 5% of our total employees) were covered by collective bargaining agreements. A dispute with a union or employees represented by a union, including a failure to extend or renew our collective bargaining agreements, could result in production interruptions caused by work stoppages. If a strike or work stoppage were to occur, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nNone of our U.S.-based employees are currently subject to a collective bargaining agreement. As we continue to grow and enter different regions, unions may attempt to organize all or part of our employee base at certain stores or within certain regions. Responding to such organization attempts may distract management and employees and may have a negative financial impact on individual stores, or on our business as a whole.\nRegulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws.\nWe source a significant portion of our products from outside the United States. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our vendor compliance agreements mandate compliance with applicable law, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in preventing our employees or other agents from taking actions in violation of these laws or regulations. Such violations, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are claims made against us from time to time that may distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability or damage to our brand.\nPeriodically, we are involved in litigation, claims and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business and employee relations. Claims may result in litigation and may result in regulatory proceedings being brought against us by federal and state agencies. Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may require significant resources. Ultimately, litigation, claims, and regulatory proceedings result in unexpected expenses and liability and could also materially adversely affect our operations and our reputation.\nChanges in statutory, regulatory, accounting, and other legal requirements could potentially impact our operating and financial results.\nWe are subject to numerous statutory, regulatory and legal requirements, domestically and abroad. Changes in the regulatory environment could potentially increase the costs of compliance and subject us to possible government penalties and litigation in the event of deemed noncompliance.\nSpecifically, significant or rapid increases to federal, state and local minimum wage rates could adversely affect our earnings if we are not able to otherwise offset these increased labor costs elsewhere in our business. Moreover, the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations in connection with climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy, including any federal or state laws enacted to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly increase our costs or reduce the demand for our products. If carbon pricing or carbon taxes are adopted, the cost of products from our suppliers could increase and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur total assets include intangible assets with an indefinite life, including goodwill and trade names, and substantial amounts of long-lived assets. Changes in estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of these assets, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates, may cause us to incur impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operation.\nWe make certain estimates and projections in connection with impairment analyses for these long-lived assets, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 360, \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d (\u201cASC 360\u201d), and ASC 350, \u201cIntangibles-Goodwill and Other\u201d (\u201cASC 350\u201d). We also review these assets for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360 or ASC 350. We will record an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the underlying asset, asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value. These calculations require us to make a number of estimates and projections of future results. If these estimates or projections change, we may be required to record additional impairment charges on certain of these assets. If these impairment charges are significant, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nAs of our annual impairment testing date of January 2, 2022, we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or trade names. Future impairment charges could be required if we do not achieve our current net sales and profitability projections or if our weighted average cost of capital increases. Moreover, changes in our market capitalization may impact certain assumptions used in our income approach calculations.\nWe may be subject to fluctuations in our tax obligations, and effective tax rates and realization of our deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, may result in volatility of our operating results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in various U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which may include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions, and valuation allowances related to certain net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. We expect to have ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by a variety of factors including but not limited to changes in the mix and level of earnings, varying tax rates in the different jurisdictions in which we operate, fluctuations in the valuation allowance, timing of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations.\nFurther, tax legislation may be enacted in the future which could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and contains numerous income tax provisions, such as relaxing limitations on the deductibility of interest, technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property and net operating loss carryback periods. During fiscal 2020, we implemented applicable benefits of the CARES Act, which included the deferral of approximately $5.2 million of employer payroll taxes and the recording of an employee retention credit of approximately $1.0 million. As of fiscal 2021, the remaining employer payroll taxes deferral is approximately $2.6 million payable in December 2022, and the Company still expects to receive approximately $1.0 million of tax credits.\nIf third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe face the risk of claims that we have infringed upon third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could (i) be expensive and time consuming to defend; (ii) cause us to cease making, licensing or using products or methods that allegedly infringe; (iii) require us to redesign, reengineer, or rebrand our products or packaging, if feasible; (iv) divert management\u2019s attention and resources; or (v) require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A\nsuccessful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products, any of which could have a negative impact on our operating results and harm our future prospects.\nOrganization and Common Stock Risks\nIf our operating and financial performance in any given period does not meet the guidance that we provide to the public, our stock price may decline.\nWe may provide public guidance on our expected operating and financial results for future periods, including sales and earnings per share. Such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results have not always been and may not always be in line with or exceed the guidance we have provided, especially in times of economic uncertainty or when there are periods of severe weather. If, in the future, our operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline as well.\nSubstantial future sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. All outstanding shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), except for any shares of our common stock that may be held or acquired by our directors, executive officers and other affiliates, as that term is defined in the Securities Act, which are subject to restrictions under the Securities Act. Certain existing holders of a majority of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other shareholders. In fiscal 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 under which certain of our shareholders may sell, from time to time, up to 32,492,421 shares of our common stock that, if sold, will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. In the event a large number of shares of common stock are sold in the public market, such sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock. For example, in fiscal 2020, Leonard Green and Partners, L.P. sold 12,172,538 shares.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities if we need to raise capital in connection with a capital raise or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with a capital raise or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe are required to comply with the rules of the SEC implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d) and our management is therefore required to provide an annual report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. As such, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nTesting and maintaining internal control can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. In addition, when evaluating our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. If we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose\nconfidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by The New York Stock Exchange, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends.\nThe continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. Accordingly, we do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Additionally, the obligors under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility and the 2019 Elfa Senior Secured Credit Facilities are currently restricted from paying cash dividends, and we expect these restrictions to continue in the future.\nOur anti-takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of our Company, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as provisions of Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our Company, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. These include:\n\u25cf authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf a provision for a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time;\n\u25cf the removal of directors only for cause;\n\u25cf no provision for the use of cumulative voting for the election of directors;\n\u25cf limiting the ability of shareholders to call special meetings;\n\u25cf requiring all shareholders\u2019 actions to be taken at a meeting of our shareholders (i.e., no provision for shareholder action by written consent); and\n\u25cf establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings.\nIn addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law, to which we are subject, prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets or business combinations with any shareholder or group of shareholders who owns at least 15% of our common stock.\nThe provision of our certificate of incorporation requiring exclusive venue in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or our certificate of incorporation or the bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine will have to be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware. In addition, our bylaws provide that the federal district courts of\nthe United States are the exclusive forum for any complaint raising a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nGeneral Risks\nOur common stock price may be volatile or may decline.\nThe market price for our common stock has been and may be volatile in the future. As a retailer, our results are significantly affected by various factors which can significantly affect our stock price, many of which are outside of our control, including the following:\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our operating results compared to market expectations;\n\u25cf changes in preferences of our customers and buying trends, and our ability to respond to such preferences and trends;\n\u25cf announcements of new products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf size of the public float;\n\u25cf stock price performance of our competitors;\n\u25cf default on our indebtedness;\n\u25cf actions by competitors or other shopping center tenants;\n\u25cf changes in senior management or key personnel;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u25cf negative earnings or other announcements by us or other retail home goods companies;\n\u25cf downgrades in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our competitors;\n\u25cf weather conditions, particularly during the holiday season and our promotional sales;\n\u25cf natural disasters, climate change, political and civil unrest or other similar events, including the war between Russia and Ukraine, and health epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf issuances or expected issuances of common stock; and\n\u25cf global economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many retail companies. In the past, shareholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nWe incur costs as a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance matters.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and the listing requirements of The New York Stock Exchange. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these reporting requirements, rules and regulations, and such requirements, rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make certain activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, these laws, rules and regulations also make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, the committees of our Board of Directors or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.", "PERMNO": 14274, "SIC": 5700, "TIC": "TCS"}
