{"cik": "1066104", "company": "CEB Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition to the risks discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could, in the future, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Other than \u201cRisks related to the Merger,\u201d unless otherwise indicated below, these risks relate to our standalone business operations without regard to the pendency or consummation of the Merger.\nRisks related to the Merger\nFailure to consummate the Merger could materially adversely affect our future business, financial results, and our stock price.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected, and we will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nhaving to pay certain costs relating to the proposed Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees, which must be paid regardless of whether the Merger is consummated;\n\u2022\nhaving to restart the process of finding a successor to our current Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d), who announced his intention to step down by June 2017 (and possibly without candidates who our Board of Directors had identified as \u201cfinalists,\u201d as they may have accepted other positions or may no longer be interested in the opportunity);\n\u2022\naddressing the retention of our CEO and possibly other senior executives for an additional period of time, to allow for the restart and completion of a new CEO search process, which is likely to impose additional (possibly material) costs on us and may not be successful;\n\u2022\naddressing any loss of personnel and/or customers that may have occurred since the announcement of the signing of the Merger Agreement, as a result of such personnel or customers believing that we would not be continuing as a stand-alone business;\n\u2022\naddressing the consequences of operational decisions made since the signing of the Merger Agreement either because of restrictions on our operations imposed by the terms of the Merger Agreement or in light of the expectation that the Merger would be consummated, including decisions to delay or defer capital expenditures; new or revised operating, marketing, or sales plans and strategies; introduction of new products and services; and acquisition, joint venture and other strategic business opportunities;\n\u2022\nresponding to additional competition from Gartner, if it decides to enter on its own some of the business lines that it sought to acquire in the Merger; and\n\u2022\nreturning the focus of our management and personnel to operating our business on a stand-alone basis without any of the benefits expected to have been provided by the consummation of the Merger.\nIn addition to the above risks, we may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Gartner a termination fee of up to $99 million, which may materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, we cannot assure our stockholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our business, financial results, and stock price to the extent the current market prices reflect a market premium based on the assumption that the Merger will be consummated.\nThe pendency of the Merger could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows.\nIn connection with the pending Merger, some of our customers or vendors may delay or defer decisions on continuing or expanding their business dealings with us, which could materially adversely affect our revenue, earnings, cash flows and expenses, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated. Similarly, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Gartner following the consummation of the Merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel during the pendency of the Merger and which may materially adversely divert attention from the daily activities of our existing employees. In addition, due to operating covenants in the Merger Agreement, we may be unable, during the pendency of the Merger, to pursue strategic transactions, undertake significant capital projects, undertake certain significant financing transactions, and otherwise pursue other actions that are not in the ordinary course of business, even if such actions would prove beneficial. Further, the Merger may give rise to potential liabilities, including those that may result in shareholder lawsuits relating to the Merger. Any of these matters could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows.\nThe consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger will not be consummated.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions that must be satisfied prior to the consummation of the Merger and may not occur, even if we obtain stockholder approval. Should the Merger fail to close for any reason, our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows may be materially adversely affected. The closing conditions under the Merger Agreement include, among others:\n\u2022\nadoption of the Merger Agreement by an affirmative majority vote of the outstanding shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger (which was filed with the SEC by Gartner on February 6, 2017);\n\u2022\nthe approval for listing by the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, of the Gartner common stock issuable to our stockholders in the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe termination or expiration of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act (early termination was granted by the FTC on February 1, 2017);\n\u2022\nthe termination or expiration of the waiting period under German competition laws (early termination was granted on February 7, 2017) and\n\u2022\nno applicable law, no legal restraint or prohibition, and no binding order or determination by any governmental entity shall be in effect that prevents, makes illegal or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or that is reasonably likely to result, directly or indirectly, in (i) any prohibition or limitation on the ownership or operation by the Company, Gartner, or any of their respective subsidiaries being compelled as a result of the Merger to dispose of or hold separate any portion of their respective businesses, properties or assets, (ii) the Company, Gartner, or any of their respective subsidiaries being compelled as a result of the Merger to dispose of or hold separate any portion of their respective businesses, properties or assets, (iii) any prohibition or limitation on the ability of Gartner to acquire or exercise full ownership rights of, any shares of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, including the right to vote or (iv) any prohibition or limitation on Gartner effectively controlling the business or operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, in each case subject to the parties obligations under the Merger Agreement to take certain actions, if necessary, to obtain regulatory approval.\nFor both Gartner and CEB, the obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to the accuracy of representations and warranties of, and the performance of obligations of, the other party, in each case as set forth in the Merger Agreement, subject to specified materiality exceptions. The obligations of each party to close are also subject to the absence of any material adverse effect on the other party. As a result of the above mentioned conditions and the other conditions described in the Merger Agreement, there can be no assurance that the Merger will be consummated, even if CEB stockholder approval of the Merger is obtained.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of CEB or could result in any competing proposal being at a lower price than it might otherwise be.\nThe Merger Agreement contains \u201cno shop\u201d provisions that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict our ability to solicit, encourage, facilitate or discuss competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of the Company. Further, even if our Board of Directors withdraws or qualifies its recommendation in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement, we will still be required to submit the matter to a vote of our stockholders. In addition, Gartner generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the proposed Merger in response to any competing acquisition proposal that may be made before our Board of Directors may withdraw or qualify its recommendation.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of CEB from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than that market value proposed to be received or realized in the Merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nNegative publicity related to the Merger may materially adversely affect CEB.\nPolitical and public sentiment in connection with a proposed combination may result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements affecting the parties to the Merger. Adverse press coverage and public statements, whether or not driven by political or popular sentiment, may also result in legal claims or in investigations by regulators, legislators, and law enforcement officials. Responding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceedings, can divert the time and efforts of our senior management from operating our businesses. Addressing any adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny, or enforcement of other legal proceedings is time-consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, could have a negative effect on our reputation, on the morale of our employees, and on our relationships with regulators. It may also have a negative impact on our ability to take timely advantage of various business and market opportunities. All of these factors may materially adversely affect our business and cash flows, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks related to our business\nWe may fail to attract new members to our memberships, services, and products, obtain renewals from existing members, or cross-sell memberships, services, and products.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from annual memberships for our memberships, products, and services. Revenue growth depends on our ability to attract prospects, sustain a high renewal rate of existing memberships, and sell additional products and services to existing members. This depends on our ability to anticipate market trends and member needs, develop effective products and services for members, develop technologically advanced methods of delivery, and deliver products and services that are more desirable than those of our competition, including in new and developing industries, business sectors, government entities, and geographies. This also depends on our ability to effectively identify, reach, and engage prospects to promote our offerings. Failure to\nattract and retain members, deliver acceptable renewal rate levels, or cross-sell memberships and products to existing members at the level we forecast, could materially adversely affect our operating results and future growth.\nWe may fail to continue to effectively develop, validate, support, and sell the products, services, and tools in our talent management business or extend our sales of those products, services, and tools to new and existing markets and geographies.\nOur talent management business develops, validates, supports, and sells products, services, and tools for employee assessment, development, and performance management, including for talent acquisition, talent development, and talent strategy and analytics. These products, services, and tools are based on the use of science and data to develop an integrated talent management strategy for clients that drives business outcomes. Revenue growth for our talent management products, including those within the CEB Talent Assessment segment, as well as those that we have acquired or are developing, depends on our expertise, our ability to continue to acquire and develop predictive assessment intellectual property, our cloud-based SaaS platform, as well as other technologically advanced methods of delivery, our proprietary database, our ability to measure results, our ability to integrate these tools and services into a unified set of product offerings, and a continuing and growing interest in managing talent through analytics specifically and in human capital management generally. Failure to maintain our expertise, develop additional and validated predictive assessment and measurement tools, extend the adoption of SaaS and SaaS-related efforts as a mechanism for delivering our products, services, and tools, as well as develop other technologically advanced methods of delivery, expand our proprietary database, demonstrate success, or a slowing or uneven interest in managing talent through analytics either in our existing or developing markets, could materially adversely affect our operating results and future growth.\nProducts, services, and tools to address talent management considerations account for a significant portion of our revenue, and a shift in demand away from talent management considerations could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\nA significant portion of our revenue results from our products, services, and tools that address a range of talent management considerations. The part of our business that focuses on talent management is affected by the level of business activity of our members, as well as the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these members serve. Economic downturns in certain segments or geographic regions may cause reductions in discretionary spending by our members, which may result in reductions in the growth of new business for our products, services, and tools, as well as reductions in existing business.\nWe may not compete successfully and, as a result, may experience reduced or limited demand for our memberships, products, and services.\nThe broad advisory services industry, as well as the human capital management sector in which we operate, is a highly competitive industry with low barriers to entry; numerous substitute products and services; shifting strategies and market positions including consolidation; many differentiators; and large global providers, as well as strong local and regional competitors. We generally compete against traditional consulting firms, benchmarking firms, role- or geographic-focused assessment companies, research and data analytics firms, training and development firms, trade associations, and nonprofit organizations, as well as providers of free content over the Internet and through other delivery channels. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are, have greater resources, and have the ability to grow and make transformative moves in the marketplace for advisory services and human capital management solutions. We also compete against new entrants from the SaaS or data analytics industries, as well as against developing technologies such as social media, business intelligence software, and workflow software. To compete successfully and achieve our growth targets, we must successfully serve new and existing members with current products and services, develop and invest in new and competitive products and services for US and international members, develop other technologically advanced methods of delivery, and deliver demonstrable return on investment to clients. Our failure to compete effectively with our competitors, both in terms of the quality and scope of our products and services, and in terms of price, could materially adversely affect our operating results and future growth.\nIf we do not retain CEB members for the duration of their membership terms, we would suffer a loss of future revenue due to our service guarantee.\nWe offer a service guarantee to some CEB research memberships under which a member may request a refund of the membership fee. When applicable, refunds are provided on a proportionate basis relative to the unused period of the membership term. Requests for refunds by a significant number of our members could materially adversely affect our operating results and future growth. Failure to retain members at the level we forecast could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property.\nOur success depends on our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of internal control, contractual arrangements, and legal protections to protect our proprietary rights. We cannot assure that the steps we have taken will be adequate to deter misappropriation\nof our intellectual property or confidential information, or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take timely and effective steps to enforce our rights, particularly as we expand our business to new geographies, where the framework related to the protection of intellectual property may be less robust than in the United States and Europe. If substantial and material unauthorized use of our proprietary rights in our memberships, products, services, and tools were to occur, we would be required to engage in costly and time-consuming litigation to enforce our rights, and we might not prevail in such litigation. If others were able to use our intellectual property, our ability to charge our fees for our memberships, products, services, or tools could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be exposed to litigation.\nAs a publisher and distributor of content, a user of third-party content, an on-line content provider, a developer and provider of talent management related strategy and analytics tools, and a global company, we face potential liability for trademark and copyright infringement, discriminatory impact, and other claims based on our products and services, as well as potential liability related to our operations, employment practices, and other business practices. Any such litigation, regardless of the merits and whether or not resulting in a judgment against us, could subject us to reputational harm and have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, certain of our talent measurement and assessment products may carry risks of litigation and related exposure for claims of non-compliance with employment laws related to hiring and promotion. These obligations could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may experience confusion about our brand.\nMarket perception of the CEB brand affects our reputation in the marketplace, our ability to attract and retain members, clients, and employees, as well as our ability to price our products at their full value. Since 2014, we have operated with a unified master brand strategy. In 2015, we continued our brand management efforts by changing our corporate name to CEB Inc., consolidating our web presence under the cebglobal.com domain, and further aligning our legacy product brands and acquired businesses under several core platforms and the CEB master brand. Beginning in 2016, SHL Talent Measurement is now referred to as CEB Talent Assessment and similarly, the newly acquired Evanta business will be transitioned as offerings under the CEB brand in 2017. If our members and clients, or prospective members or clients, are confused by our brand strategy, or if we do not effectively transfer brand equity and enhance the brand experience from our legacy or acquired brands, or if our efforts to extend our brand equity from these various brands into existing or target markets are unsuccessful, our operating results and future growth could be materially adversely affected.\nEconomic uncertainty in the United States and the global economy could materially adversely impact our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\nEconomic uncertainty in the United States and the global economy could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity. These conditions also could materially adversely impact our existing and prospective members and clients, vendors, business partners, and growth prospects. If we are unable to successfully anticipate or adapt to uncertain or changing economic, financial, market, and government conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to these changes, and our business could be materially adversely affected. While we market and sell our products and services to large and middle market enterprises throughout the year, a significant percentage of our new business and renewal bookings in the CEB segment historically have taken place in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Significant economic uncertainty during these time periods could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our current and future operating results. In addition, slowing growth in certain markets and sales channels could reduce the overall demand for professional information services and human capital management resources as global companies, government entities, and large and middle market enterprises continue to manage purchasing, departmental budgets, company-wide discretionary spending, and reduce or manage their focus on talent management solutions.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes leading up to and following the UK\u2019s likely exit from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn June 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), commonly referred to as Brexit. It is expected that the UK government will initiate a process to withdraw from the EU and begin negotiating the terms of its separation. The announcement of Brexit resulted in significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the US dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business. This change has had the effect of reducing the amount of our reported revenue, as sales recorded in currencies other than the USD are translated into US dollars at a lower exchange rate. In addition, this exchange rate change has reduced the reported amount of those expenses that we pay for in currencies other than the USD, again because of the lower translation into US dollars. If there is additional volatility in currency exchange rates, the impact on our reported results could be material in future periods. The announcement of Brexit and likely withdrawal of the UK from the EU may also create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets. This outcome could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash\nflows. The terms and timing of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU cannot currently be predicted. Consequently, there may be additional impacts from Brexit in the future, any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to a number of risks as a US government contractor, which could harm our reputation, result in fines or penalties against us, and/or materially adversely impact our financial condition.\nCertain of our products are tailored for the public sector and provide services to US government agencies, and therefore, expose us to risks and added costs associated with government contracting, as well as risks of doing business with the federal government more generally. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in contract terminations, suspension or debarment from contracting with the US government, civil fines and damages, and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those anticipated. In addition, the ongoing impact of sequestration and the possibility of further sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011 or other government dysfunction could result in contract terminations and slowing sales, which could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nUS government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\u201cDCAA\u201d) routinely audit our US government contracts and contractors\u2019 administration processes and systems. An unfavorable outcome to an audit by the DCAA or another agency could cause our operating results to differ materially from those anticipated. If an investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the US government. In addition, we would suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these factors could cause actual operating results to differ materially from those anticipated. In addition, the continuing US government spending restrictions could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nRisks related to our operations\nOur acquisitions involve risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by our operations, and our acquisitions may not achieve their anticipated results.\nThrough our acquisitions, we expect that we will be able to realize various benefits, including, among other things, new product development and product enhancements, cross-selling and revenue enhancement opportunities, geographic expansion, cost savings, and operating efficiencies.\nOur acquisitions bring us capabilities and intellectual properties that address gaps in member and client needs and workflows. These acquisitions involve financial, operational, human resources, business, legal, and regulatory risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by our ongoing operations, including difficulties in accurately valuing the businesses; difficulties and costs of integrating and maintaining the operations, personnel, technologies, products, vendors, and information systems of the businesses; difficulties achieving the target synergies, efficiencies, and cost savings; more cyclicality than what exists in our best practices and decision support products and services; failure to retain key personnel and members; possibility of brand confusion; entry into and ongoing management of new geographical or product markets; exposure under acquisition-related agreements; the diversion of financial and management resources; management distraction; and the integration of a different set of products and services into our existing operations. As a result, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of our acquisitions and could incur unanticipated increased costs, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and future growth.\nWe regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses and products and may from time to time pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe enhance our business. We may not be successful in identifying acquisition opportunities, assessing the value of the opportunities, or completing acquisitions on favorable terms. Future acquisitions may result in dilution to earnings and may involve potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt.\nOur international operations involve special risks.\nIn 2016, approximately 36% of our revenue related to business located outside the United States and we expect to continue expanding internationally.\nOur international operations involve risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by our US operations, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in developing products, services, and technology tailored to the needs of members and clients around the world, including in emerging markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in serving members and clients around the world, including in emerging markets;\n\u2022\ndifferent employment laws and rules and related social and cultural factors that could result in cyclical fluctuations in use and revenue;\n\u2022\ndependence on distributors and other third parties;\n\u2022\ncultural and language differences;\n\u2022\nlimited recognition of our brand;\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory and compliance requirements, including in the areas of privacy and data protection, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, trade sanctions, marketing and sales, and other barriers to conducting business;\n\u2022\nabsence, in some jurisdictions, of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulties in managing our operations outside of the United States;\n\u2022\ndifferent or less stable political, operating, and economic environments and market fluctuations;\n\u2022\ncivil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity;\n\u2022\nhigher operating costs;\n\u2022\nlower operating margins;\n\u2022\ndiffering accounting principles and standards;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations between the USD and foreign currencies that could materially adversely affect financial and operating results;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on or adverse tax consequences from entity management efforts; and\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in United States or foreign tax laws.\nIf we are not able to efficiently adapt to or effectively manage our business in markets outside of the United States, our business prospects and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our member and client data.\nIn the normal course of operations, we collect and maintain confidential and sensitive data, including personal information, from members and clients. We rely on a complex network of technical safeguards and internal controls to protect this data. Failure to adequately protect this data, including failure to continue to improve our internal controls or failure to prevent the misuse of or misappropriation of member and client data, could result in data loss, corruption, or breach. If a data loss, corruption, or breach occurs, we could be exposed to litigation from members and clients, our reputation could be harmed, and we could lose existing and have difficulty attracting new members and clients, all of which could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges to privacy and data protection rules and regulations may make compliance more complex and challenging. Such changes could increase the cost of compliance, which could lower the margins or profitability of our business. Our failure to comply with or implement processes in this area could result in legal liability, damage to our reputation in the global marketplace, or added considerations around commercial activity. Additionally, regulations frequently allow for the imposition of substantial fines and penalties, thereby creating a greater risk of significant financial impact should we fail to comply.\nWe may fail to adequately operate, maintain, develop, and protect our information technology infrastructure.\nOur information technology infrastructure serves our global memberships and clients and supports our employees and operations. Our failure to make the capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements necessary to remain technologically advanced, meet our internal operational and business needs and allow us to service our memberships and clients could materially adversely affect our delivery of existing products and services, our development of new products and services, our reputation, and our operating results and future growth.\nIncreased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data processed and stored on those systems and networks. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, including employee training; technical security controls; comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems; and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions, and services remain potentially vulnerable to various threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information;\nimproper use of our systems and networks; manipulation and destruction of data; defective products; production downtimes; and operational disruptions, which in turn could materially adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness, and operating results.\nIn addition, we deliver our memberships, products, and services to members and clients primarily through online means. Although we have implemented plans and procedures to address service interruptions, we could experience natural disasters, power loss, cyber-attacks, operator error, or similar events, which could cause an interruption in service or damage to our facilities and/or data. Our disaster recovery and business continuity plans and procedures are designed to address many of the potential service interruptions, but these safeguards may prove to be insufficient or not as effective as anticipated, and may not be adequate to prevent interruptions from certain causes or unforeseen types of events. Such service interruptions could prevent us from providing services to our members and clients or cause us to violate service level agreements with our members, which could materially adversely affect our ability to retain existing members and clients and attract new members and clients. In addition, such service interruptions or any perceptions of unreliability could materially adversely affect our ability to retain existing members and clients and harm our ability to attract new members and clients.\nUpdates and replacements of key internal systems and processes, particularly our CRM and ERP system, or problems or delays with the design or implementation of these systems and processes could interfere with, and therefore harm, our business and operations.\nIn 2016, we began a multi-year project to update and replace certain key internal systems and processes, including our customer relationship management system and our enterprise resource planning system, to enable a single global platform that will support business growth and drive business process simplification and standardization. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these systems and processes, which are intended to transform our operations and give us greater agility as our business grows in size and complexity. We have opted to decelerate the design and implementation schedule of these systems. Any problems, disruptions, delays, or other issues in the design and implementation of the new systems or processes, particularly any that impact our operations, could materially adversely affect our ability to process customer orders, deliver products and services, provide service and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, collect payment from our customers, record and transfer information in a timely and accurate manner, recognize revenue, file SEC reports in a timely manner, or otherwise run our business. Even if we do not encounter these adverse effects, as noted above, the design and implementation of these new systems and processes may be much more costly and take more time than we anticipated, especially if the Merger is not consummated. If the Merger is not consummated and as a standalone company we are unable to successfully design and implement these new systems and processes as planned, or if the implementation of these systems and processes is more lengthy or costly than anticipated, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nOur lease of significant office space in Arlington, Virginia and planned corporate headquarters consolidation are subject to several risks, including landlord and subtenant default and our inability to sublease unused space.\nWe are currently party to three leases of office building space in Arlington, Virginia. We intend to relocate and consolidate our corporate headquarters in early 2018 into a single building in Arlington that is under construction. We expect that the planned consolidation will result in us being subject to two office leases in Arlington, and that we will continue to sublease a substantial portion of that space to others, including an existing major subtenant. If the major subtenant, or other subtenants, default on their lease obligations to us, or if we are unable to sublease all or part of our space available for sublease at acceptable rents or at all, we may incur substantial additional lease costs and expenses and/or experience material loss of sublease rental income, which could materially adversely affect our operating results. If our new corporate headquarters is not completed on schedule, or if the new headquarters landlord or its guarantors default on their obligations pursuant to the new headquarters lease, we may incur material costs and expenses, and/or be required to pay additional rental amounts. Unanticipated difficulties in consolidating our operations in our new corporate headquarters, including IT system interruptions, may result in loss of employee and operational productivity and additional costs and expenses, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to revenue recognition, income taxes, and other contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe may be subject to future impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.\nAt December 31, 2016, the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets was $565.0 million and $184.2 million, respectively, and represented 40% and 13%, respectively, of our total assets of $1.4 billion. We apply a fair value test to evaluate goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and between these periods if events occur or circumstances change, which suggest that the goodwill or intangible assets should be evaluated. The testing of goodwill for potential impairment inherently involves management judgments as to the assumptions used to project amounts included in the valuation process and as to anticipated future market conditions and their potential effect on future performance. Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the determination of fair value, and assumptions and estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties, including many over which we have little or no control. The potential for goodwill impairment is increased during a period of economic uncertainty or following a significant acquisition. In 2016, we recorded impairment losses of $69.4 million related to the Evanta reporting unit, including $67.9 million related to goodwill and $1.5 million related to intangible assets. In 2014, we recorded impairment losses of $39.7 million, including $20.8 million related to customer list intangible assets and $18.9 million related to goodwill of the PDRI reporting unit. The fair value of the CEB Talent Assessment reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 9% at October 1, 2016. The CEB Talent Assessment reporting unit remains at risk for future impairment if the projected operating results are not met or other inputs in the fair value measurements change. Changes in our business strategy or changes in market or other conditions could result in declining performance that would require us to examine our goodwill for potential impairment and could lead to a requirement that we record additional impairment charges, which would materially adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may materially adversely affect our effective tax rates.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States, the UK, and numerous other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our provision for income taxes. We also are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional tax against us. Our global operations subject us to additional tax regimes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation, or the effects of a change in tax policy in the United States or in any of the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we do business, could have a material effect on our operating results in the period or periods for which that determination is made. Changes in the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate are anticipated to arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) proposals issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries that encompass most of the jurisdictions in which we operate, has published action plans aimed at addressing perceived issues within tax systems that may lead to tax avoidance by companies. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to accurately assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our effective tax rate at this time, and that could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to foreign currency risk.\nWe serve executives and professionals in more than 70 countries around the world. Prices for CEB segment memberships, products, and services primarily are denominated in USD; however, we do offer foreign currency billing to members outside of the United States in the British pound sterling, Euro, and Australian dollar. Prices for CEB Talent Assessment tools and services are primarily denominated in the local currency. As a result of operating outside the United States, we are at risk for exchange rate fluctuations, which could affect our operating results.\nWe use forward contracts, primarily cash flow hedging instruments, to mitigate a portion of these risks. The maximum length of time of these hedging contracts is 12 months. Although we believe that our foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances, they only partially offset any adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially if these changes are extreme and occur over a short period of time. Hedging transactions involve certain additional risks such as counterparty risk, the legal enforceability of hedging contracts, the early repayment of hedged transactions, and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in foreign exchange rates may cause a significant loss of basis in the contract and change in current period expense. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to enter into hedging transactions or that such hedging transactions will adequately protect us against the foregoing risks. In addition, any cash flow hedges not perfectly correlated (and appropriately designated and documented as such) with foreign exchange transactions would impact our reported income as gains and losses on the ineffective portion of such hedges would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk.\nBorrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same. We may or may not enter into interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any\nswaps we may enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. Additionally, hedging transactions involve certain additional risks such as counterparty risk, the legal enforceability of hedging contracts, the early repayment of hedged transactions, and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates may cause a significant loss of basis in the contract and a change in current period expense.\nIn the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt before maturity or as it matures, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all. If interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase. Furthermore, if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook, our debt and equity securities could be materially adversely affected.\nHedging instruments often are not guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house and involve risks and costs.\nHedging instruments involve risk since they are often not guaranteed by an exchange or a clearing house. The enforceability of agreements underlying derivative transactions may depend on compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. The business failure of a hedging counterparty with whom we enter into a hedging transaction will most likely result in a default. Default by a party with whom we enter into a hedging transaction may result in the loss of unrealized gains and force us to cover our resale commitments, if any, at the then current market price. Although we generally seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions, it may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty, and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract to cover our risk. We cannot assure that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold, and we may be required to maintain a position until expiration, which could result in losses.\nOur leverage could materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Notes.\nTotal consolidated debt at December 31, 2016 was $874.6 million, net of issuance costs, consisting of the Term Loan A-3 Loans, Revolving Credit Facility, and Notes. In addition, we had $88.8 million of undrawn availability under the Revolving Credit Facility (after $240.0 million of outstanding borrowings and a reduction of availability to cover $21.2 million of outstanding letters of credit) at December 31, 2016. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt, which may result in defaults;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our outstanding indebtedness, which have a variable rate of interest, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly;\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Notes limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional indebtedness. This may include additional indebtedness under certain circumstances that may also be guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our ability to incur additional indebtedness may have the effect of reducing the amounts available to pay amounts due with respect to our indebtedness. If we incur new debt or other liabilities, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nOur ability to make required payments or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business and economic conditions, and other factors, many of which are not in our control. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nIf we are in default under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities due to our inability to make the required payments or if we otherwise fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, all of our debt would become immediately due and payable and the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities could be permitted to foreclose on our assets securing such debt.\nThe covenants in our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Notes impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Notes include negative covenants or limitations that may, subject to exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume, or suffer to exist liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments and loans;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume, or suffer to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, sale-leasebacks, and other asset sales and dispositions;\n\u2022\npay dividends or redeem, or repurchase our capital stock, except in certain specified circumstances;\n\u2022\nalter the business that we and our subsidiaries conduct;\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with officers, directors, and affiliates;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or purchase other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into certain burdensome agreements; and\n\u2022\nmake material changes to accounting and reporting practices.\nIn addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities include a financial covenant that subjects us to a maximum net leverage ratio.\nOperating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in us being unable to comply with certain covenants contained in our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Notes. If we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, our debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Notes would be in default and could be accelerated and could permit the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the debt thereunder. If the indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our cash flows, operating results, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nAny decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders or repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our previously announced stock repurchase program could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nWe may reduce or discontinue repurchases of our common stock as we deem appropriate and as market conditions allow. We may modify, suspend, or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time. Any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Moreover, in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of shares of our common stock are reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends or repurchasing shares of our common stock at historical levels could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments.\nFrom time to time, we may invest in companies to further their strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives. Such investments could include equity or debt instruments in private companies that may be non-marketable. The success of these companies may depend on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. If any of these private companies fail, we could lose all or part of our investment in that company. If we determine that impairment indicators exist and that there are other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of the investment, we may be required to write down the investments to their fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss.\nRisks related to our people\nWe may be unable to hire and retain key personnel, recruit and retain highly skilled management and employees, or effectively plan for succession, particularly after the announcement of the proposed Merger with Gartner.\nContinued and future success of our business depends on our ability to hire, train, and retain key personnel, including senior leaders; skilled sales, research, and entry-level personnel; and the industrial and organizational psychologists and other individuals who are a critical component of our talent management business; and to hire, train, and retain highly skilled management and employees, including from our acquisitions. Once hired, new employees, particularly our new sales staff, can experience a delay in productivity until they are fully trained; and significant numbers of entry-level sales staff can impact our overall productivity. We experience competition for new hires and our existing employees from competitors and other businesses wherever we do business. We have employer protection agreements with senior staff that restrict them from competing with and soliciting employees from us following their employment. Further, the pendency of the Merger creates additional uncertainty that makes hiring, retention, and succession planning particularly difficult. If we fail to retain key personnel, or to attract, train, and retain a sufficient number of management and employees, including entry-level sales staff, in the future, our operating results and future growth could be materially adversely affected, and the morale and productivity of our workforce in the near term could be disrupted.\nEffective succession planning is a key factor for our long-term success. Failure to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions with regard to key employees could materially adversely affect our long-term strategic planning and execution and negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. If we fail to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions for key personnel, the operating results and future growth for our business could be materially adversely affected, and the morale and productivity of the workforce could be disrupted.\nWe rely on our executive officers, corporate leadership team, and the leaders of our geographic regions and departments for the success of our business.\nWe rely on our executive officers, corporate leadership team, and the leaders of geographic regions and departments to manage our operations. Given the range of our products and services, the scale of operations, and geographic scope, these executives and senior managers must have a thorough understanding of our product and service offerings and operations, as well as the skills and experience necessary to manage a large organization in diverse geographic locations. If one or more members of our management team leave and we cannot replace them with suitable candidates quickly, or if members of our management team are not able to demonstrate the skills necessary in a global business, we could experience difficulty in managing our business properly. If the Merger is not consummated, we may also encounter challenges in hiring qualified personnel to replace key employees that may depart during the pendency of the Merger. In addition, we would need to restart the search process for a new CEO and potentially retain the existing CEO and other senior executives who are not expected to remain at Garner while seeking replacement candidates. This could harm our business prospects, client relationships, employee morale, and operating results.", "PERMNO": 86720, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "CEB"}
