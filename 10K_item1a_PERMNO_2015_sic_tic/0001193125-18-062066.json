{"cik": "800240", "company": "OFFICE DEPOT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to us and our industry could materially impact our future performance and results. We have provided below a list of risk factors that should be reviewed when considering investing in our securities.\nRisks related to our business\nOur business is highly competitive and failure to adequately differentiate ourselves or respond to the decline in general office supplies sales or to shifting consumer demands could continue to adversely impact our financial performance.\nThe office products market is highly competitive and we compete locally, domestically and internationally with office supply resellers, including Staples, internet-based companies such as Amazon.com, mass merchandisers such as Wal-Mart and Target, wholesale clubs such as Costco, Sam\u2019s Club and BJs, computer and electronics superstores such as Best Buy, food and drug stores, discount stores, and direct marketing companies. Many competitors have also increased their presence by broadening their assortments or broadening from retail into the delivery and e-commerce channels, while others have substantially greater financial resources to devote to sourcing, marketing and selling their products. Product pricing is also becoming ever more competitive, particularly among competitors on the internet. In order to achieve and maintain expected profitability levels, we must continue to grow by adding new customers and taking market share from competitors. In addition, consumers are utilizing more technology and purchasing less paper, ink and toner, physical file storage and general office supplies. The CompuCom Division operates in an environment that is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to shifting client needs and expectations. We compete with companies that provide IT services and outsourcing, as well as companies that sell IT related products. If we are unable to: (i) provide technology solutions and services that meet consumer needs; (ii) continuously stock products that are up-to-date and among the latest trends in the rapidly changing technological environment; (iii) differentiate ourselves from other retailers who sell similar products; and (iv) effectively compete, our sales and financial performance could be negatively impacted.\nOur business strategy includes making acquisitions and investments that complement our existing business. These acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur ability to achieve the benefits we anticipate from acquisitions we make will depend in large part upon whether we are able to leverage the capabilities of the acquired companies to grow revenue across our combined organization, manage the acquired company\u2019s business, execute our strategy in an efficient and effective manner and realize anticipated cost synergies. Because our business and the business of acquired companies may differ, we may not be able to manage the acquired company\u2019s business smoothly or successfully and the process of achieving expected revenue growth and cost synergies may take longer than expected. If we are unable to successfully manage the operations of the acquired company\u2019s business, we may be unable to realize the revenue growth, cost synergies and other anticipated benefits we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition.\nIn addition, private companies recently acquired which were previously not subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), may lack certain internal controls, which could ultimately affect our ability to ensure compliance with the requirements of SOX.\nOur focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation.\nOur transformation into a more business services-driven platform that delivers a full range of services complements our product offerings, including consultation, design, delivery, installation, set-up, protection plans,\nrepair, and technical support. These services can differentiate us from many of our competitors and provide an opportunity to deliver superior customer service while generating additional revenue and profit. However, designing, marketing and executing these services successfully and consistently is subject to incremental risks. These risks include, for example:\n\u2022\nincreased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises, which may be higher than the related revenue;\n\u2022\nunpredictable warranty failure rates and related expenses;\n\u2022\nemployees in transit using company vehicles to deliver products or services to customers; these factors may increase our scope of liability related to our employees\u2019 actions; and\n\u2022\nemployees having access to customer devices, including the information held on those devices, which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the data they hold.\nIn addition, as customers increasingly migrate to websites and mobile applications to initiate transactions, it is inherently more difficult to demonstrate and explain the features and benefits of our service offerings, which can lead to a lower revenue mix of these services. Our ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. If we are unable to pivot into a more business services-driven platform and sell innovative new products, our ability to gain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.\nFailure to execute effective advertising efforts may adversely impact our financial performance.\nEffective advertising and marketing efforts play a crucial role in maintaining high customer traffic. We focus on developing new marketing initiatives and maintaining effective promotional strategies that target further growth in our business. Failure to execute effective advertising efforts to attract new customers or retain existing customers may adversely impact our financial performance.\nIf we are unable to successfully maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWith the increasing use of computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online, we offer full and mobile versions of our website and applications for mobile phones and tablets. In addition, we are increasing the use of social media as a means of interacting with our customers and enhancing their shopping experiences. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors. If we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract third parties with the specialized skills needed to support our omni-channel platforms, or are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if our website and our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, the customer experience could be negatively affected, resulting in a loss of customer confidence and satisfaction, and lost sales, which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe depend on our executive management team and other key personnel, and the recruitment and retention of certain personnel could adversely affect our performance and result in the loss of management continuity and institutional knowledge. We depend heavily upon our retail labor force to identify new customers and provide desired products and personalized customer service to existing customers. The market for qualified employees, with the right talent and competencies, is highly competitive, and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment. The loss of the services of key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified managers for our retail stores and other lines of business may adversely affect our ability to conduct operations in accordance with the standards that we have set.\nAlthough certain members of our executive team have entered into agreements relating to their employment with us, most of our key personnel are not bound by employment agreements, and those with employment or retention agreements are bound only for a limited period of time. If we are unable to retain our key personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop and implement our business plans, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nDisruptions of our computer systems could adversely affect our operations.\nWe rely heavily on computer systems to process transactions, manage our inventory and supply-chain and to summarize and analyze our global business. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, or, if we do not replace or upgrade certain systems, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience an interruption of our normal business activities or loss of critical data. We are undertaking certain system enhancements and conversions to increase productivity and efficiency, that, if not done properly, could divert the attention of our workforce and constrain for some time our ability to provide the level of service our customers demand. Also, once implemented, the new systems and technology may not provide the intended efficiencies or anticipated benefits, and could add costs and complications to our ongoing operations.\nA breach of our information technology systems could adversely affect our reputation, business partner and customer relationships and operations and result in high costs.\nThrough our sales, marketing activities, and use of third-party information, we collect and store certain personally identifiable information that our customers provide to purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on our website, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. This may include, but is not limited to, names, addresses, phone numbers, driver license numbers, e-mail addresses, contact preferences, personally identifiable information stored on electronic devices, and payment account information, including credit and debit card information. We also gather and retain information about our employees in the normal course of business. We may share information about such persons with vendors that assist with certain aspects of our business. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, such as information permitting cashless payments.\nWe have instituted safeguards for the protection of such information. These security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, burglaries, cyber-attack, errors by employees or employees of third-party vendors, faulty password management, misappropriation of data by employees, vendors or unaffiliated third-parties, or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our data or accounts. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, we cannot be certain that all of our systems and those of our vendors and unaffiliated third-parties are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or compromise given that the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently. During the normal course of our business, we have experienced and we expect to continue to experience attempts to breach our systems, and we may be unable to protect sensitive data and the integrity of our systems or to prevent fraudulent purchases. Moreover, an alleged or actual security breach that affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information could:\n\u2022\nmaterially damage our reputation and brand, negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, expose us to negative publicity, individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, civil or criminal investigations or actions, and infringe on proprietary information; and\n\u2022\ncause us to incur substantial costs, including but not limited to costs associated with remediation for stolen assets or information, payments of customer incentives for the maintenance of business relationships after an attack, litigation costs, lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack, and increased cyber security protection costs. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of our cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.\nWe do a significant amount of business with government entities, various purchasing consortiums, and through sole- or limited- source distribution arrangements, and loss of this business could negatively impact our results.\nOne of our largest customer groups consists of various governmental entities, government agencies and non-profit organizations, such as purchasing consortiums. Contracting with U.S. state and local governments is highly competitive, subject to federal and state procurement laws, requires more restrictive contract terms and can be expensive and time-consuming. Bidding such contracts often requires that we incur significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will win a contract. Our ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the federal and various state and local governments is highly dependent on cost-effective performance. Our business with governmental entities and agencies is also sensitive to changes in national and international priorities and their respective budgets, which in the current economy continue to decrease. We also service a substantial amount of business through agreements with purchasing consortiums and other sole- or limited-source distribution arrangements. If we are unsuccessful in retaining these customers, or if there is a significant reduction in sales under any of these arrangements, it could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nMacroeconomic conditions have had and may continue to adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nOur operating results and performance depend significantly on economic conditions and their impact on business and consumer spending. In the past, the decline in business and consumer spending has caused our comparable store sales to decline from prior periods. Our business and financial performance may continue to be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, including, without limitation, the level of consumer debt, high levels of unemployment, higher interest rates and the ability of our customers to obtain credit, which may cause a continued or further decline in business and consumer spending.\nIncreases in fuel and other commodity prices could have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nWe operate a large network of stores, delivery centers, and delivery vehicles. As such, we purchase significant amounts of fuel needed to transport products to our stores and customers as well as shipping costs to import products from overseas. While we may hedge our anticipated fuel purchases, the underlying commodity costs associated with this transport activity may be volatile and disruptions in availability of fuel could cause our operating costs to rise significantly to the extent not covered by our hedges. Additionally, other commodity prices, such as paper, may increase and we may not be able to pass along such costs to our customers. Fluctuations in the availability or cost of our energy and other commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the actions of and risks related to the activities of our third-party vendors.\nWe purchase products for resale under credit arrangements with our vendors and have been able to negotiate payment terms that are approximately equal in length to the time it takes to sell the vendor\u2019s products. When the global economy is experiencing weakness as it has in the past, vendors may seek credit insurance to protect against non-payment of amounts due to them. If we continue to experience declining operating performance, and if we experience severe liquidity challenges, vendors may demand that we accelerate our payment for their products or require cash on delivery, which could have an adverse impact on our operating cash flow and result in severe stress on our liquidity. Borrowings under our existing credit facility could reach maximum levels under such circumstances, causing us to seek alternative liquidity measures, but we may not be able to meet our obligations as they become due until we secure such alternative measures.\nWe use and resell many manufacturers\u2019 branded items and services. As a result, we are dependent on the availability and pricing of key products and services, including ink, toner, paper and technology products. As a\nreseller, we cannot control the supply, design, function, cost or vendor-required conditions of sale of many of the products we offer for sale. Disruptions in the availability of these products or the products and services we provide to our customers may adversely affect our sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. Further, we cannot control the cost of manufacturers\u2019 products, and cost increases must either be passed along to our customers or will result in erosion of our earnings.\nFailure to identify desirable products and make them available to our customers when desired and at attractive prices could have an adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. In addition, a material interruption in service by the carriers that ship goods within our supply chain may adversely affect our sales. Many of our vendors are small or medium sized businesses which are impacted by current macroeconomic conditions, both in the U.S., Asia and other locations. We may have no warning before a vendor fails, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur product offering also includes many of our own branded products. While we have focused on the quality of our own branded products, we rely on third-party manufacturers for these products. Such third-party manufacturers may prove to be unreliable, the quality of our globally sourced products may not meet our expectations, such products may not meet applicable regulatory requirements which may require us to recall those products, or such products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties. Furthermore, economic and political conditions in areas of the world where we source such products may adversely affect the availability and cost of such products. In addition, our own branded products compete with other manufacturers\u2019 branded items that we offer. As we continue to increase the number and types of our own branded products that we sell, we may adversely affect our relationships with our vendors, who may decide to reduce their product offerings through us and may increase their product offerings through our competitors. Finally, if any of our customers are harmed by our own branded products, they may bring product liability and other claims against us. Any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nDisruption of global sourcing activities and our own brands\u2019 quality concerns could negatively impact brand reputation and earnings.\nEconomic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source products, as well as shipping and dockage issues, could adversely impact the availability or cost of our products, or both. Most of our goods imported to the U.S. arrive from Asia through ports located on the U.S. west coast and we are therefore subject to potential disruption due to labor unrest, security issues or natural disasters affecting any or all of these ports. In addition, in recent years, we have substantially increased the number and types of products that we sell under our own brands including Office Depot\u00ae, OfficeMax \u00ae and other proprietary brands. While we have focused on the quality of our proprietary branded products, we rely on third-parties to manufacture these products. Such third-party manufacturers may prove to be unreliable, the quality of our globally sourced products may vary from our expectations and standards, such products may not meet applicable regulatory requirements which may require us to recall those products, or such products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties. Moreover, as we seek indemnities from the manufacturers of these products, the uncertainty of realization of any such indemnity and the lack of understanding of U.S. product liability laws in certain foreign jurisdictions make it more likely that we may have to respond to claims or complaints from our customers.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds, refinance indebtedness, obtain new funding or issue securities.\nWhile Merger- and restructuring-related costs have been significant between 2013 and 2017, historically, we have generated positive cash flow from operating activities and have had access to broad financial markets that provide the liquidity we need to operate our business. Together, these sources have been used to fund operating and working capital needs, as well as invest in business expansion through new store openings, capital improvements and acquisitions. Deterioration in our financial results or the impact of significant Merger, integration and restructuring costs could negatively impact our credit ratings, our liquidity and our access to the\ncapital markets. If we need to refinance all or a portion of that indebtedness, there is no assurance that we will be able to secure such refinancing at the same or more favorable terms than the terms of our existing indebtedness.\nCovenants in our credit facility and term loan could adversely impact our operations.\nOur asset-based credit facility contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant that is operative only when borrowing availability is below $125 million or prior to a restricted transaction, such as incurring additional indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, or share repurchases if we do not have the required liquidity. The agreement governing our credit facility (the \u201cAmended Credit Agreement\u201d as defined in Note 8, \u201cDebt,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements) also contains representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and default provisions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our Amended Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our Amended Credit Agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders were to accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our asset based credit facility and our other indebtedness. Also, should there be an event of default, or a need to obtain waivers following an event of default, we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and/or more restrictive covenants in future periods. Acceleration of our obligations under our credit facilities would permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations.\nIn addition, the CompuCom acquisition was funded, in part, with a new $750 million term loan facility. This Term Loan Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 8, \u201cDebt,\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements) contains representations and warranties, events of default, and affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for similar financings and which include, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, restrictions on the ability to declare or pay dividends subject to compliance with an annual limit, repurchase common stock, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets, and merge or consolidate with any other person. In addition, a minimum liquidity maintenance covenant, requiring us and our restricted subsidiaries to retain unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and availability under our Amended Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount of at least $400 million, will apply at any time that our senior secured leverage ratio is greater than 1.50:1.00 and will be calculated quarterly. As of December 30, 2017, our leverage ratio was 1.16:1.00.\nWe have incurred significant impairment charges and we continue to incur impairment charges.\nWe regularly assess past performance and make estimates and projections of future performance at an individual store level. Reduced sales, our shift in strategy to be less price promotional, as well as competitive factors and changes in consumer spending habits resulted in a downward adjustment of anticipated future cash flows for the individual stores that resulted in the impairment. We foresee challenges in the market and economy that could adversely impact our operations. To the extent that forward-looking sales and operating assumptions are not achieved and are subsequently reduced, or if we commit to a more aggressive store downsizing strategy, including allocating capital to further modify store formats, additional impairment charges may result. We have also recognized non-cash asset impairment charges from the abandonment of assets identified as not to be used in the post-Merger organization and from certain lease-related intangible assets that were deemed unrecoverable based on the Comprehensive Business Review. Additional asset impairments may be recognized based on future decisions and conditions.\nChanges in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates we make, in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, including changes resulting from macroeconomic, or disposition of components within reporting units, could in the future require a reduction of goodwill and recognition of related non-cash impairment charges. If we were required to further impair our store assets, our goodwill or intangible assets, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation due to the seasonality of our business.\nOur business is somewhat seasonal, with sales generally trending lower in the second quarter, following the \u201cback-to-business\u201d sales cycle in the first quarter and preceding the \u201cback-to-school\u201d sales cycle in the third quarter and the holiday sales cycle in the fourth quarter. As a result, our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, with sales and profitability being generally stronger in the second half of our fiscal year than the first half of our fiscal year. Factors that could also cause these quarterly fluctuations include: the pricing behavior of our competitors; the types and mix of products sold; the level of advertising and promotional expenses; severe weather; macroeconomic factors that affect consumer confidence; and the other risk factors described in this section. Most of our operating expenses, such as occupancy costs and associate salaries, are not variable, and so short term adjustments to reflect quarterly results are difficult. As a result, if sales in certain quarters are significantly below expectations, we may not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter, and therefore such a sales shortfall would have an adverse effect on our net income for the quarter.\nWe have retained responsibility for liabilities of acquired companies that may adversely affect our financial results.\nOfficeMax sponsors defined benefit pension plans covering certain terminated employees, vested employees, retirees, and some active employees (the \u201cPension Plans\u201d). The Pension Plans are frozen and do not allow new entrants, however, they are under-funded and we may be required to make contributions in subsequent years in order to maintain required funding levels. Required future contributions could have an adverse impact on our cash flows and our financial results. Additional future contributions to the Pension Plans, financial market performance and Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) funding requirements could materially change these expected payments.\nAs part of the sale of our business in Europe, we have retained responsibility for the defined benefit plan covering certain employees in the United Kingdom. While the plan was in a net asset position at the end of the year 2017, changes in assumptions and actual experience could result in that plan being considered underfunded in the future. Additionally, we have agreed to make contributions to the plan as required by the trustees. Financial performance of the plan and future valuation assumptions could materially change the expected payments. In addition, as part of the sale transaction, the purchaser shall indemnify and hold us harmless in connection with any guarantees in place as of September 23, 2016, and given by us in respect of the liabilities or obligations of the European Business. Further, if the purchaser wishes to terminate any such guarantee or cease to comply with any underlying obligation which is subject to such a guarantee, the purchaser shall obtain an unconditional and irrevocable release of the guarantee. However, we are contingently liable in the event of a breach by the purchaser of any such obligation.\nIn connection with OfficeMax\u2019s sale of its paper, forest products and timberland assets in 2004, OfficeMax agreed to assume responsibility for certain liabilities of the businesses sold. These obligations include liabilities related to environmental, asbestos, health and safety, tax, litigation and employee benefit matters. Some of these retained liabilities could turn out to be significant, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our exposure to these liabilities could harm our ability to compete with other office products distributors, who would not typically be subject to similar liabilities.\nChanges in tax laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate can cause fluctuations in our overall tax rate impacting our reported earnings.\nOur tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. While we have disposed of the majority of our international businesses and are actively marketing for sale other international businesses, we remain subject to international taxes in other businesses. Depending upon the sources of our income, any agreements we may have with taxing authorities in\nvarious jurisdictions, and the tax filing positions we take in these jurisdictions, our overall tax rate may fluctuate significantly from other companies or even our own past tax rates. In addition, changes in applicable U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations, including the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our tax expense and profitability. At any given point in time, we base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate upon a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to us and to estimates of the amount of income likely to be generated in any given geography. The loss of or modification to one or more agreements with taxing jurisdictions, whether as a result of a third party challenge, negotiation, or otherwise, a change in the mix of our business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in valuation allowances, or adverse outcomes from the tax audits that regularly are in process in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in substantial volatility, including an unfavorable change in our overall tax rate and/or our effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings, which from time to time may involve class action lawsuits, state and federal governmental inquiries, audits and investigations, environmental matters, employment, tort, state false claims act, consumer litigation and intellectual property litigation. At times, such matters may involve directors and/or executive officers. Certain of these legal proceedings, including government investigations, may be a significant distraction to management and could expose our Company to significant liability, including settlement expenses, damages, fines, penalties, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and non-monetary sanctions, including suspensions and debarments from doing business with certain government agencies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to successfully manage our business could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nCircumstances outside of our control could negatively impact anticipated store openings, joint ventures and strategic alliances. We cannot provide assurance that our new store openings, including some newly sized or formatted stores or retail concepts, will be successful. There may be unintended consequences of adding joint venture, strategic alliances and franchising partners to the Office Depot model, such as the potential for compromised operational control in certain countries and inconsistent international brand image. These joint venture, strategic alliances and franchise arrangements may also add complexity to our processes, and may require unanticipated operational adjustments in the future that could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur international operations subject us to risks as foreign currency fluctuations, potential unfavorable foreign trade policies or unstable political and economic conditions.\nUntil the disposition of our international business operations is complete, we remain subject to various international risks. Additionally, we have operations in Canada, Mexico, India and certain global sourcing operations in Asia. Sales from our operations outside the U.S. are denominated in local currency, which must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and therefore our consolidated earnings can be significantly impacted by fluctuations in world currency markets. We are required to comply with multiple foreign laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country, requiring significant management attention and cost. In addition, the business cultures in certain areas of the world are different than those that prevail in the U.S., and we may be at a competitive disadvantage against other companies that do not have to comply with standards of financial controls or business integrity that we are committed to maintaining as a U.S. publicly traded company.\nChanges in the regulatory environment may increase our expenses and may negatively impact our business.\nWe are subject to regulations relating to our corporate conduct and the conduct of our business, including securities laws, consumer protection laws, trade regulations, advertising regulations, privacy and cybersecurity\nlaws, and wage and hour regulations and anti-corruption legislation. Certain jurisdictions have taken a particularly aggressive stance with respect to such matters and have implemented new initiatives and reforms, including more stringent regulations, disclosure and compliance requirements. For example, we purchase product both directly and indirectly from sources outside of the United States. As a consequence, trade restrictions, including new or increased tariffs, quotas, embargoes, sanctions, safeguards and customs restrictions, could increase our cost of goods sold or reduce the supply of the products available to us. There is no assurance that any such increased costs could be passed on to our customers, or that we could find alternative products from other sources at comparable prices. To the extent that we are subject to more challenging regulatory environments and enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, such exposure could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the added cost of increased compliance measures that we may determine to be necessary.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Our policies mandate compliance with all anti-bribery laws. However, we operate in certain countries that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption. Our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third-party intermediaries. Violations of these anti-bribery laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIncreases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor regulations could impact our financial results and cash flow.\nOur expenses relating to employee labor, including employee health benefits, are significant. Our ability to control our employee and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform, and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Unfavorable changes in employee and related labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flow.\nOur business could be disrupted due to weather-related factors.\nOur operations are heavily concentrated in the Southern and Midwestern U.S. (including Illinois, Ohio, Florida and the Gulf Coast). Because of our concentration in the Southern U.S., we may be more susceptible than some of our competitors to the effects of tropical weather disturbances, such as tornadoes and hurricanes. In addition, winter storm conditions in areas that have a large concentration of our business activities could also result in reduced demand for our products, lost retail sales, supply chain constraints or other business disruptions. We believe that we have taken reasonable precautions to prepare for weather-related events, but our precautions may not be adequate to mitigate the adverse effect of such events in the future.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, the south-central and southeast areas of the United States, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, were impacted by three powerful hurricanes that disrupted normal operations at some of our retail stores and impacted sales in our Business Solutions Division. While most of these stores have resumed operations, many of these stores continue to be impacted by the hurricanes, either as a result of damage incurred, or they are experiencing declines in customer traffic driven by reduced hours and disrupted shopping patterns in those areas.\nThe unionization of a significant portion of our workforce could increase our overall costs and adversely affect our operations.\nWe have a large employee base and while our management believes that our employee relations are good, we cannot be assured that we will not experience organization efforts from labor unions. The potential for unionization could increase if federal legislation is passed that would facilitate labor organization. Significant union representation would require us to negotiate wages, salaries, benefits and other terms with many of our employees collectively and could adversely affect our results of operations by significantly increasing our labor costs or otherwise restricting our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations.\nOur failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results.\nEffective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our omni-channel strategy. Most of our properties are subject to long term leases. As such, it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our long term real estate strategy. Such factors include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nchanging patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving omni-channel environment;\n\u2022\nthe appropriate number of stores in our portfolio;\n\u2022\nthe formats and sizes of our stores;\n\u2022\nthe locations of our stores;\n\u2022\nthe interior layouts of our stores;\n\u2022\nthe trade area demographics and economic data of each of our stores;\n\u2022\nthe local competitive positioning in and around our stores;\n\u2022\nthe primary term lease commitment for each store;\n\u2022\nthe long-term lease option coverage for each store;\n\u2022\nthe occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents;\n\u2022\nour supply chain network strategy; and\n\u2022\nour ongoing network of service locations.\nIf we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example:\n\u2022\nhaving to close stores and abandon the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;\n\u2022\nincurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;\n\u2022\nhaving stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and\n\u2022\nbearing excessive lease expenses.\nThese consequences could have a materially adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.\nFor leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local real estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors, and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. In addition to rent, we are still responsible for the maintenance, taxes, insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessor. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sub-lease tenant.\nThere can be no assurance that we will pay cash dividends.\nOur Board of Directors has authorized a quarterly dividend program. Decisions regarding dividends are within the discretion of the Board of Directors, and will be influenced by a number of factors, including general business and economic conditions, our financial condition, operating results and restrictions imposed by our debt agreements, the emergence of alternative investment or acquisition opportunities, changes in business strategy and other factors. Changes in, or the elimination of dividends could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be subject to volatility, shareholders could incur substantial losses of any investment in our stock.\nOur stock price has experienced volatility over time and this volatility may continue, in part due to factors mentioned in this Item 1A. The price of common stock is subject to sudden and material increases and decreases, any decrease could adversely affect shareholder confidence and the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 75573, "SIC": 5940, "TIC": "ODP"}
