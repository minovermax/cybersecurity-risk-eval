{"cik": "1646228", "company": "At Home Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. A number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to the factors described below, could materially adversely affect our business, business prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and stock price, and may cause actual results, performance or achievements in future periods to differ materially from those assumed, projected or contemplated. All forward-looking statements made by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in our Annual Report to our Stockholders and in subsequent reports we file with the SEC, as well as in our press releases and other public communications, are qualified by the risks described below, as may be updated by subsequent reports we file with the SEC.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Strategy\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth.\nThe Company\u2019s operations depend significantly on economic conditions in the U.S. and countries related to our international supply chain. Any adverse macroeconomic conditions, or uncertainty regarding such conditions, could reduce overall consumer discretionary spending and erode consumer confidence, and thereby reduce overall spend in retail stores generally, cause consumers to shift their spending to products other than those sold by us, or cause our customers to buy products sold by us that are less profitable than other product choices. Adverse macroeconomic conditions that could impact us include: slower growth or a recessionary economy; certain changes in monetary policy; reduced employment levels; increased inflation; higher healthcare costs; increased fuel and other energy costs; bankruptcies; increased real estate leasing costs; declines in home or asset values; higher consumer debt levels; lower availability of credit; and increased taxes and interest rates. The foregoing adverse macroeconomic factors also may materially adversely affect our supply chain, other business partners, landlords and service providers in the U.S. and globally. Any such adverse macroeconomic conditions or uncertainties regarding such conditions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth.\nDuring different periods of fiscal year 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had materially adverse and materially positive impacts on our business. The future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend largely on future macroeconomic, scientific, health, legal and regulatory developments.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions to the U.S. and global economies, and it has substantially impacted our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. From time to time, in an effort to mitigate the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, various government, regulatory and private entities have implemented significant restrictions, including stay-at-home orders, quarantines, travel restrictions and restrictions on public gatherings. Due to these restrictions in the first fiscal quarter of 2021 and a desire to take strong precautions, we closed all of our stores in late March 2020. We gradually opened stores in compliance with state and local mandates. The temporary closure of our stores and decline in store traffic as we gradually reopened stores resulted in significantly reduced net sales and cash flows from operations during such period, although we eventually obtained rent relief from certain landlords to partially offset the negative financial impacts. As a result of the decline in our operating performance and sustained decline in our market capitalization driven by the pandemic, as well as the\nreduction of our near-term growth model, we determined goodwill was fully impaired and we recognized an impairment charge of $319.7 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2021.\nTo enhance our liquidity during this period, we significantly cut our capital expenditures, including suspension or delay of new store openings, store remodels and consulting projects, and implemented critical inventory management. As noted in the following risk factor, our growth strategy primarily is focused on successfully opening and operating new stores, and we suspended all new store openings and remodeling projects in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with the exception of seven stores that were at or near completion.\nFor the last three quarters of fiscal year 2021, we reported strong store traffic, net sales, gross margins and cash flows due to a number of macroeconomic and consumer trends in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as strong home sales, nesting and de-urbanization and pent-up demand in general and for home d\u00e9cor products. These results may not be indicative of results for future periods, including if current favorable trends do not continue or are offset by other adverse impacts. For example, some of the increased customer demand may have been due to temporary impacts of the pandemic, including an intense focus on a person\u2019s home as well as U.S. stimulus payments in fiscal year 2021. While additional stimulus payments have been approved in fiscal year 2022, consumers may utilize such payments differently than the prior stimulus payments, especially upon a successful vaccine rollout in significant numbers that impacts consumer behavior.\nThe extent and nature of the future impact of COVID-19 on our business is highly uncertain, and will depend largely on future macroeconomic, scientific, health, legal and regulatory developments within the United States and countries that are part of our supply chain. Recurring COVID-19 outbreaks have led to the re-introduction of some restrictions on retail operations in certain jurisdictions and such restrictions could be re-introduced more broadly. There can be no assurance that our stores will not be subject to modified hours, operations, capacity limitations and store closures in future periods, which may reduce sales. Further, in such case, we may not be able to obtain additional rent relief from our landlords. Any extended store closures could put increased demand on our omnichannel platform. Many of our larger, significant competitors have more highly developed omnichannel platforms and they may be able to more quickly and effectively respond to such changes in consumer behavior.\nOur supply chain was adversely affected in fiscal year 2021, and continues to be adversely affected, by international equipment shortages and shipping delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the spring of 2020, while managing stay-at-home orders and store closures, we canceled orders and reduced the amount of inventory coming into our stores. As store traffic and net sales improved, we sought to strengthen our inventory positions. We believe these trends across the industry have caused significant congestion in the supply chain due to a global surge in demand for shipping space. Our increased net sales in last three quarters of fiscal year 2021 caused us to require shipping space well above our contracted volumes. While we are managing our inventory by working with our vendors to prioritize freight and minimize the impact where possible, this supply chain congestion has caused delays in our receipt of inventory. We are highly dependent on our third-party supply chain, and any further adverse impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on their future ability to manufacture or deliver products to us could lead to inventory constraints in certain product categories and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying market volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.\nWe significantly curtailed opening new stores in fiscal year 2021 and we plan to open fewer net new stores in fiscal year 2022 than our long-term growth goal. Our ability to successfully re-implement our new store strategy in future periods, on a timely basis or at all, would have a material impact on our business, results of operations, brand and stock price.\nOur growth strategy primarily is focused on successfully opening and operating new stores. However, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we suspended all new store openings and remodeling projects in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with the exception of seven stores that were at or near completion.\nWe intend to open approximately 15 net new stores in fiscal year 2022, while also refreshing or remodeling a portion of our existing store base. Beginning in fiscal year 2023, we intend to open net new stores in line with our strategy of 10% net new stores per year. Our ability to successfully re-implement our new store strategy in future periods, on a timely basis or at all, would have a material impact on our business, results of operations, brand and stock price. The success of this strategy is dependent upon, among other things: the retail environment and other macroeconomic factors discussed above; the identification of suitable markets and the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, lease economics and demographics; the negotiation of acceptable lease terms; construction costs; the hiring, training and retention of local employees; and efficiently managing new inventory and distribution processes.\nOur results of operations have been and will continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings.\nThe performance of new stores may vary depending on the time of year of the store opening, store opening and occupancy costs, our brand and reputation in the market and the location of the new store, including whether it is located in a new or existing market. A new store in a new geographic market, where we are less familiar with the population and are less well known, may face different or additional risks. On the other hand, new stores in the same or adjacent geographic regions could result in competition among our stores. Further, we incur higher than normal employee and marketing costs for a store opening, while also typically benefitting from higher net sales in the initial opening period.\nOur long-term planned store expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial, administrative and other resources. We have continually made investments in our inventory management and allocation systems, distribution systems, financial and management controls and information systems. Managing our growth effectively, including increasing our omnichannel platform, will require us to continue to enhance the foregoing and incur capital investment and expenses. Our return on investment, business and results of operations will be adversely affected if we cannot manage our growth effectively, including competitive and operating challenges.\nFailure to obtain, manage and allocate our inventory effectively and our inability to satisfy changing consumer preferences could materially adversely affect our business and profitability.\nWe are focused on providing the broadest assortment of everyday and seasonal products, offering over 50,000 SKUs throughout our large format stores. Our ability to maintain our appeal to existing customers and attract new customers depends on our ability to originate, develop and offer a compelling product assortment responsive to customer preferences and design trends. Our business is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts, suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases, and distribution, and challenges with inventory management and allocating product among store locations. We have not always accurately identified consumer trends and predicted our customers\u2019 preferences in particular store markets or in aggregate, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully do so in the future. We are more promotional in our selling activities when we have excess inventories for particular products, which adversely impacts our profitability, and we will continue this pricing strategy in future periods as necessary.\nObtaining the right inventory and allocating such inventory is particularly critical with our seasonal products. For example, our seasonal purchases for Halloween and Christmas in fiscal year 2021 were made at time when many of our stores were closed due to the pandemic and there was significant economic uncertainty. While customer demand was very high for Halloween and Christmas seasonal product, we did not have sufficient inventory to meet such demand. Although we make opportunistic seasonal buys to supplement our earlier purchasing decisions, this ability has limitations. Our purchasing strategy and inventory constraints have and may continue to limit our growth and net sales below customer demand.\nDifficulties with our vendors, disruptions in our supply chain, increased commodity prices or increased freight and transportation costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers and vendors to supply all of our products. Our performance depends on our ability to purchase merchandise at sufficient levels and at competitive prices from vendors who can deliver products\nin a timely and efficient manner and in compliance with our vendor standards and all applicable laws and regulations. While we historically have not relied on any single vendor or small group of vendors for our products and have not had difficulties replacing vendors for various products we sell, there is no assurance that we will continue to be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities or on terms acceptable to us, or be able to develop relationships with new vendors to replace any discontinued vendors. Our current strategy includes rationalizing our SKUs, creating more privately branded products and streamlining our supply chain, all of which may increase our reliance on particular manufacturers and vendors in future periods.\nOur ability to access products from our vendors has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by geopolitical conflict and instability, public health issues (including the global COVID-19 pandemic and related quarantines), the financial instability of vendors, vendors\u2019 noncompliance with applicable laws and our product requirements, trade restrictions, port closures and congestion, tariffs, and any disruptions in our vendors\u2019 distribution network, supply chain or information technology systems. Our supply chain was adversely affected in fiscal year 2021, and continues to be adversely affected, by international equipment shortages and shipping delays due to the pandemic, the impact of which is further exacerbated by the record demand for our products and sales growth in recent quarters. We expect our cost of sales and gross margin will be significantly impacted by an increase in freight costs due to the global shipping shortage. There is also typically a two-quarter lag from when we ship product to when these costs are expensed, so recent shortages and delays and resulting incremental freight costs will impact our profitability greater in the second half of fiscal year 2022 and future impacts will have a similar time lag. Disruptions within our supply chain could adversely affect our ability to obtain inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in reduced sales, increased supply chain costs or reputational harm.\nWe are adversely affected by substantial increases in product costs due to commodity cost increases or general inflation, including with respect to freight and transportation costs. Prices of certain commodities used in our merchandise, such as petroleum, resin, copper, steel, cotton and lumber, are subject to fluctuation arising from changes in currency exchange rates, tariffs and trade restrictions and labor, fuel, freight and other transportation costs. In recent years, we have faced inflationary pressure on freight costs, which were heightened by tariff-related shipment surges and port congestion. Our costs and expenses could be materially adversely impacted by higher freight and transportation costs.\nDue to the uncertainty of commodity price fluctuations and inflation and our strategy to maintain everyday low prices, we may not be able to pass some or all of these increased costs on to our customers (which lowers our gross margins) and attempting to pass along increased costs to customers has in the past had, and may continue to have, a direct negative impact on comparable store sales. Even if we are able to pass these increased costs on to our customers, we may not be able to do so on a timely basis, our gross margins could decline and we may not be able to implement other price increases for our merchandise. Any rapid and significant changes in commodity prices or other supply chain costs would further exacerbate the foregoing risks.\nWe are subject to international risks because we import a significant portion of our merchandise.\nAlthough our stores are based solely in the U.S., our business is subject to certain risks of a global company because we rely on foreign manufacturers and vendors to supply a large majority of our merchandise. Approximately 65% of our merchandise was purchased from vendors in foreign countries such as China, Vietnam, India, Turkey, Mexico and Hong Kong during fiscal year 2021, which percentage is consistent with recent prior fiscal years. In fiscal year 2021, we sourced additional product from various countries to mitigate the impact of high-tariff categories goods from China. In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources. For example, we purchase merchandise from domestic suppliers that is imported from China or that is manufactured in China. Currently, we do not employ any resources on the ground in Asia to manage our procurement process and various supplier relationships. Instead, we often rely on trading companies to handle sourcing and logistics with Asian factories, although this will be partially mitigated as we increase our use of direct sourcing. Our significant international supply chain increases the risk that we will not have adequate and timely supplies of various products due to local political, economic, social or environmental conditions (including political instability, international conflicts, acts of terrorism or natural disasters), epidemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), transportation delays (including dock strikes,\ninefficient freight requirements, and other work stoppages), restrictive actions by foreign governments or changes in U.S. laws, trade policy and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution.\nAll of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the U.S. are subject to duties collected by the U.S. Customs Service. We may be subjected to additional duties or tariffs, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import or the loss of import privileges if we or our suppliers are found to be in violation of U.S. laws and regulations applicable to the importation of our products. Tariffs also can impact our or our vendors\u2019 ability to source product efficiently or create other supply chain disruptions. The tariffs enacted in fiscal year 2019 did not have a material adverse impact on our gross margin due to a combination of supplier negotiations, direct sourcing and strategic price increases. However, the additional tariffs enacted in fiscal year 2020 led us to institute strategic price increases, which had a direct negative impact on comparable store sales. We may not be able to fully or substantially mitigate the impact of future tariffs, pass price increases on to our customers or secure adequate alternative sources of products.\nOur inability to efficiently operate or manage disruptions in our distribution network could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe operate cross-dock distribution centers in Plano, Texas and Carlisle, Pennsylvania, as well as warehouse premises in Garland, Texas. The majority of our inventory is shipped directly from suppliers to our distribution centers where the inventory is processed promptly and shipped to our stores. We rely in large part on the orderly operation of this receiving and distribution process, which depends on our automated distribution system, adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of our distribution network. We do not have significant storage at the distribution centers or stores (other than what is on store shelves) or otherwise. Disruptions in the operations of any distribution facility due to natural or man-made disasters, epidemic disease, fire, flooding, terrorism or other catastrophic events, system failure, labor disagreements or shipping problems may significantly impair our ability to receive and deliver inventory on a timely basis, and could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe expect to make additions and upgrades to our infrastructure investments in the future to continue to support our operating model over a significantly expanded store base. We made significant investments relating to our second distribution center in Pennsylvania, which opened in the beginning of fiscal year 2020, and incurred net operating costs in connection therewith during fiscal year 2020 that impacted our operating margins.\nWe rely upon independent third-party transportation providers to deliver products to our distribution centers from vendors and from our distribution centers to our stores. Our use of third-party transportation providers for shipments is subject to various risks, including labor shortages or capacity constraints in the transportation industry, disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure, fuel shortages or transportation cost increases (such as increases in fuel costs or port fees). Any disruption, unanticipated expense or operational failure related to our distribution network could negatively affect certain store operations and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any significant expansion of our omnichannel strategy may exacerbate the foregoing risks.\nWe operate in a highly competitive retail environment and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can.\nThe retail home d\u00e9cor business is highly competitive. Because of the fragmented nature of the home d\u00e9cor market, we compete with a diverse group of retailers, including mass merchants, home improvement and craft stores, home specialty/d\u00e9cor retailers, as well as various other small, independent retailers. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and larger customer bases than we have, and as a result may have a more advanced omnichannel platform, be able to adapt quicker to changes in consumer behavior, have larger and more dependable customer loyalty programs, and maintain higher profitability in an aggressive low pricing environment. Rapidly evolving technologies are altering the manner in which retailers communicate and transact with customers, led by internet-based and omnichannel retailers that have made significant investments in recent years, including with pricing technology and shipping capabilities. Our current strategy is designed to increase our ability to compete, but it remains subject to significant execution risk that will require adjustments over time, including to address future investments made by larger competitors. Slower growth or a loss of customers, net sales or market share could require us to increase marketing and\nadvertising expenditures or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns (in particular due to our everyday low pricing strategy), each of which could materially adversely affect our margins and profitability.\nOur inability to successfully execute and optimize our omnichannel retail strategy and maintain a relevant and reliable omnichannel experience for our customers could materially adversely affect our business, growth, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to appeal to existing and potential customers, who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs. Consumers, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, are increasingly embracing various shopping methods and customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are evolving. We may be challenged to further develop our omnichannel capabilities while continuing to optimize our physical store operations and maintaining profitability. Our omnichannel strategy has and will continue to require investment in technology, operational changes and management focus. Changes in consumer shopping habits may reduce customer traffic at our current physical retail locations, which may lead to a decline in our operating performance. There is also no assurance that any of our current or future omnichannel initiatives will offset any decline in store traffic.\nOmnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors. We may not be able to compete as effectively with seasoned e-commerce retailers or larger omnichannel competitors who have more well established omnichannel and online sales and distribution networks, and greater resources than we do to devote to these strategies. In fiscal year 2021, we nationally launched our BOPIS program, curbside pick-up and local delivery options, although the vast majority of sales continue to be in our stores. If our omnichannel offerings are unable to compete against other omnichannel competitors to attract customers, or if any future expanded omnichannel offerings are not successful, our ability to compete with other retailers would be diminished and our business, growth, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe investment and growth in our omnichannel capabilities also increases our vulnerability to other material risks and uncertainties, including changes in required technology interfaces, technical failures, costs and technical issues related to upgrading website software, changes in applicable federal and state regulations, data security and ransomware breaches, consumer privacy concerns and maintaining competitive technology, some of which we do not control. It also may take longer than anticipated to generate the expected benefits from our omnichannel initiatives and there can be no guarantee that these initiatives will provide the anticipated benefits or result in improved results of operations.\nAdverse events in the primary regions of our operations and our supply chain could materially adversely affect our business.\nAs of January 30, 2021, our store base was comprised of 219 stores in 40 states, primarily in the South Central, Southeastern, Eastern and Midwestern regions of the United States, including 37 stores in Texas. In addition, our headquarters and primary distribution center, as well as a warehouse, are in Texas, and we operate a second distribution center in Pennsylvania. Any extreme weather (such as the winter storm that impacted Texas in February 2021), natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events, terrorism, blackouts, widespread illness (such as the global COVID-19 pandemic) or unfavorable regional economic conditions in such areas, as well as regions related to our supply change, could materially adversely affect our business. Such events could result in physical damage to or destruction or disruption of one or more of our properties, physical damage to or destruction of our inventory, the closure of one or more stores, the lack of an adequate workforce in parts or all of our operations, supply chain disruptions, data and communications disruptions and the inability of our customers to shop in our stores.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, as well as our sale-leaseback strategy.\nWe lease a significant number of our store locations, as well as our two distribution centers and our corporate office. If we are unable to effectively manage our existing portfolio of real estate leases, renew existing leases or lease suitable alternative locations, enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms, optimize our existing stores or, if necessary, close underperforming stores, our growth and profitability would be negatively impacted. Our growth strategy\nprimarily includes opening new stores, requiring that we regularly enter into new leases at current market rental rates and incur capital expenditures to build the lease to suit, which may adversely impact our operating margins.\nWhile we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions, including by making specified payments, we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when desired. If we decide to close stores, we are generally required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases, which often include, among other things, paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term, or paying to exercise rights to terminate. When we assign leases or sublease space to third parties, we may remain liable on the lease obligations, which could lead to significant expense if the assignee or sublessee does not perform. In addition, when the lease terms for the stores in our ongoing operations expire, our ability to renew such expiring leases on commercially acceptable terms or, if such leases cannot be renewed, our ability to lease a suitable alternative location on favorable terms will each depend on many factors, such as conditions in the local real estate market, competition for desirable properties and our relationships with current and prospective lessors.\nFrom time to time, we engage in sale-leaseback transactions, the net proceeds from which have been used to reduce outstanding debt and fund future capital expenditures for new store development; however, the sale-leaseback market may cease to be a reliable source of additional cash flows for us in the future if capitalization rates become less attractive or other unfavorable market conditions develop, which could result in an increase in financing expense.\nFailure to attract, develop and retain quality employees and to manage labor costs (including any impact of a significantly increased minimum wage) could materially adversely affect our business and profitability.\nOur performance depends on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees at the store operations level, in distribution centers, and at the corporate level, all at costs that allow us to conduct our operations profitably. Many of our store employees are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs, while managing our labor costs, is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified employees in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor laws (including changes in the process for our employees to join a union) or other workplace regulation. In the event of changes in the federal or state minimum wage, living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations, including, for example, health care or employee leave regulations, or if our overall compensation and benefits fail to remain competitive, then the quality of our workforce could decline, our labor costs may increase and our business and profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is moderately seasonal and weak sales during one of our peak seasons could have a disproportionate effect on our overall results of operations and financial condition.\nOur net sales and operating income fluctuate seasonally due to our seasonal and holiday merchandise, with a higher level of our operating income typically realized during the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Any decrease in sales or margins during these periods could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations and financial condition for the fiscal year.\nIn anticipation of seasonal increases in sales activity during these periods, we incur significant additional expense prior to and during our peak seasonal periods, which we may finance with additional short-term borrowings. Seasonal fluctuations affect our inventory levels and staffing levels. In particular, we must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the spring and holiday season selling periods. If we are not successful in selling our inventory, we may have to write down our inventory, sell it at significantly reduced prices (which is part of our historical pricing strategy) or not be able to sell it at all, any of which could cause our gross margins to decline and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions to our information systems, or our failure to adequately support, maintain and upgrade these systems, could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for finance and accounting functions, merchandising and inventory management, administrative functions, inventory management, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and on our website, supply chain management, delivery services, loyalty rewards functionality and various other processes and transactions. Additionally, the success of initiatives to drive growth through omnichannel operations is highly dependent on our technology systems. We also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. We may be unable to improve, upgrade, integrate or expand upon our existing systems on a timely basis, and any costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.\nAlthough we, as well as our third-party service providers, have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these information technology systems or platforms to operate effectively. Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, computer viruses, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third-party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks (including ransomware). If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve these issues, such system failures could also disrupt our ability to track, record and analyze sales and inventory, process financial information (including credit card transactions), process payroll or vendor payments or engage in other similar normal business activities. The foregoing risks could cause reputational harm and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm our business and standing with our customers and subject us to penalties under data protection rules and privacy laws.\nWe regularly receive and store information about our customers, employees, vendors and other third parties. In connection with certain activities, including payment processing, website hosting, data encryption and software support, among others, we utilize third-party service providers, and we believe we take appropriate steps to require such providers to secure such information and periodically assess their ability to do so. We invest considerable resources in maintaining our computer systems and protecting sensitive information, but our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may nevertheless be vulnerable to security breaches, cybercrimes, computer viruses, programming or human errors or other similar events, some of which may not be immediately detected. A breach of our security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, resulting in unauthorized access to stored personal information could cause us to incur significant costs to restore the integrity of our data and systems, and subject us to government penalties and private litigation, any of which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, and cause reputational harm. The recent increase in remote working by our employees and the increase in online orders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate any of the foregoing risks. While we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy any damage to our reputation in the event of a data security incident.\nThe legal and regulatory environment regarding cybersecurity and data privacy is increasingly complex and expansive, including enhanced requirements for using and treating personal data. Although we have implemented policies and procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, these matters are increasingly subject to enforcement, litigation and increasing complexities. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with applicable current or future laws and regulations, we could incur substantial costs or be exposed to further litigation and regulatory risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cause reputational harm.\nRisks Relating to Debt and Liquidity\nOur debt and our ability to increase future leverage could limit our operating flexibility and material adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows.\nAlthough currently we have significant borrowing availability, historically we have had periods of significant leverage and any future increased leverage could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry (placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are less highly leveraged), reduce our ability to use cash flows for operating, investing and financing opportunities (including working capital, capital expenditures, mergers and acquisitions and equity or debt repurchases), and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the agreements governing our indebtedness. Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under the ABL Facility and the Senior Notes indenture depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future. We are a holding company and do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests of our subsidiaries, and our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on their ability to general sufficient cash flows and distribute funds to us. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the ABL Facility and the Senior Notes indenture and to fund other liquidity needs. Failure to generate sufficient cash flow would require us to refinance or restructure our debt or seek to raise additional capital (which could be dilutive to stockholders). If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the ABL Facility or the Senior Notes indenture. Furthermore, the ABL Agreement and the Senior Notes indenture contain covenants that may restrict our ability to implement our business plan, finance future operations, pay dividends, respond to changing business and economic conditions, secure additional financing, and engage in certain transactions (including mergers, acquisitions and dispositions).\nIf we default under the ABL Agreement or the Senior Notes indenture because of an inability to meet our payment obligations, a covenant breach or otherwise, all outstanding amounts thereunder could become immediately due and payable. We cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds to repay all the outstanding amounts under the ABL Facility or the Senior Notes indenture, and any acceleration of amounts due would have a material adverse effect on our business, growth strategy, liquidity, financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern. We and our subsidiaries also may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the foregoing restrictions, which could exacerbate the leverage risks noted above.\nCertain of our variable rate indebtedness bears interest based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is expected to be discontinued generally after 2021. While our material financing arrangements indexed to LIBOR provide procedures for determining an alternative base rate in the event that LIBOR is discontinued, there can be no assurances as to whether such alternative base rate will be more or less favorable than LIBOR. Any changes in regulatory standards or industry practices, such as the transition away from LIBOR as a benchmark reference for short-term interest rates, may result in increased interest expense.\nFrom time to time, based on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors and subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we may seek to utilize cash on hand, borrowings or raise capital to retire, repurchase or redeem our Notes, repay debt, repurchase shares of our common stock or otherwise enter into similar transactions to support our capital structure and business or utilize excess cash flow on a strategic basis.\nRisks Relating to Regulatory and Litigation Matters\nRegulatory or litigation developments could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and reputation.\nWe are subject to numerous regulatory and legal requirements at local, state, national and international levels, including based upon our business operations, status as a publicly traded company, store locations, workforce, sales to consumers and importation of merchandise. Failure to comply with these legal requirements could result in, among other\nthings, increased litigation and regulatory risk that could result in significant administrative and third party expenses, monetary damages including fines and penalties, administrative enforcement actions, and civil and criminal liability, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and reputation.\nSubstantial regulatory uncertainty exists regarding international trade and trade policy, both in the United States and abroad, in particular in recent years due to multiple tranches of tariffs on certain goods imported from China and related trade disputes, as well as the impact of the new free trade agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico. In addition, any changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting labor and employment, trade, product safety, cybersecurity and data privacy, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, responsible sourcing, operations or environmental issues, among others, may increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance. In addition, if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery laws, we could be subject to reputational and legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation. Although we undertake to monitor changes in these laws, if these laws change without our knowledge, or are violated by importers, manufacturers, vendors or agents, we could experience delays in shipments and receipt of goods, or be subject to fines or other penalties under the applicable regulations, any of which could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nProduct recalls and/or product liability, as well as changes in product safety and other consumer protection laws, may adversely impact our operations, merchandise offerings, reputation, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe are subject to regulations by a variety of federal, state and international regulatory authorities, including the Consumer Product Safety Commission. We face enhanced risks since all of our products are manufactured by third parties, including a significant portion from foreign manufacturers that may not adhere to U.S. product safety requirements or customary quality control standards, and we might not identify any deficiency before merchandise ships to our stores. If our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers\u2019 expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. We could be required to recall some of those products or could expose ourselves to government enforcement action or private litigation, such as product liability claims, which could result in significant fines, penalties, monetary damages and other remedies as well as harm to our reputation. We could also be subject to litigation related to injuries or other accidents at our stores or distribution centers.\nMoreover, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs to us for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. Long lead times on merchandise ordering cycles increase the difficulty for us to plan and prepare for potential changes to applicable laws. In particular, The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 imposes significant requirements on manufacturing, importing, testing and labeling requirements for some of our products. In the event that we are unable to timely comply with regulatory changes, significant fines or penalties could result, and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the recent years and may continue to do so in the future. Future announcements or management discussions concerning us or our competitors, sales and profitability results, quarterly variations in results of operations or comparable sales (due to seasonality or otherwise), updates on our strategic initiatives, changes in earnings estimates by analysts or the failure of investors or analysts to understand our business strategies or fundamental changes in our business or sector, among other factors, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may deter takeover efforts and other actions that stockholder believe are in their best interests, or limit the ability of our stockholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nDelaware law and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws make it harder for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include, among other things: establishing a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time; limiting the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent; authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquirer; eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and requiring at least two-thirds of the voting power of our outstanding stock entitled to vote to amend or repeal or certificate of incorporation or bylaws. In addition, our certificate of incorporation imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of at least 15% of our capital stock. The foregoing measures could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company, discourage proxy contests, making it more difficult to change directors on the Board and otherwise make it more difficult for stockholders to accomplish changes that they otherwise deem to be in their best interests.\nFurther, our certificate of incorporation restricts the forum for certain litigation against us to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Our stockholders are deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. This choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of At Home.\nTo remain successful in the future, we must continue to preserve, grow and utilize the value of our reputation as the destination retailer for our customers\u2019 home d\u00e9cor needs. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents may erode trust and confidence. Damage to our reputation could arise from product failures, data privacy or security incidents, litigation or various forms of adverse publicity, especially in social media outlets, and may generate negative customer sentiment, and could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16268, "SIC": 5700, "TIC": "HOME"}
