Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. Many of these risks relate to our new businesses and will be increasingly critical as we invest additional funds in these businesses and acquire additional mortgage loans. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses. The following is a summary of some of the more important factors that could affect our businesses:\nMarket\n\u2022General economic developments and trends and the performance of the housing, real estate, mortgage finance, and broader financial markets may adversely affect our business and the value of, and returns on, real estate-related and other assets we own or may acquire and could also negatively impact our business and financial results.\n\u2022Federal and state legislative and regulatory developments and the actions of governmental authorities and entities may adversely affect our business and the value of, and the returns on, mortgages, mortgage-related securities, and other assets we own or may acquire in the future.\n\u2022Unpredictability of the credit markets may restrict our access to capital and may make it difficult or impossible for us to obtain any required additional financing.\n\u2022The future development and growth of our crypto ATM business is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate. If the crypto business opportunities do not grow as we expect, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperational\n\u2022We may not be successful in entering into new businesses and markets, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022Our use of leverage may expose us to substantial risks.\n\u2022Operational risks, including those associated with our business model, may disrupt our businesses, result in losses or limit our growth.\n\u2022We depend on key personnel to manage our business, and the loss of any key person\u2019s services, combined with our inability to identify and retain a suitable replacement for such person, could materially adversely affect us. Additionally, the cost to retain our key personnel could put pressure on our operating margins.\n\u2022Our inability to manage future growth effectively could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022If we fail to develop, enhance and implement strategies to adapt to changing conditions in the real estate and capital markets, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nInvesting\n\u2022The nature of the assets we hold and the investments we make expose us to credit risk that could negatively impact the value of those assets and investments, our earnings, dividends, cash flows, and access to liquidity, or otherwise negatively affect our business.\n\u2022We may have concentrated credit risk in certain geographical regions and may be disproportionately affected by an economic or housing downturn, natural disaster, terrorist event, climate change, or any other adverse event specific to those regions.\n\u2022The timing of credit losses can harm our economic returns.\n\u2022Our efforts to manage credit risks may fail.\n\u2022Multifamily and business purpose mortgage loan borrowers that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic may not make payments of principal and interest relating to their mortgage loans on a timely basis, or at all, which could negatively impact our business.\n\u2022Changes in prepayment rates of mortgage loans could reduce our earnings, dividends, cash flows, and access to liquidity.\n\u2022Interest rate fluctuations can have various negative effects on us and could lead to reduced earnings and increased volatility in our earnings.\n\u2022Our growth may be limited if assets are not available or not available at attractive prices.\n\u2022We may change our investment strategy or financing plans, which may result in riskier investments and diminished returns.\n(table of contents)\n\u2022The performance of the assets we own will vary and may not meet our earnings or cash flow expectations. In addition, the cash flows and earnings from, and market values of loans, we own may be volatile.\n\u2022The inability to access financial leverage through warehouse and repurchase facilities, credit facilities, or other forms of debt financing may inhibit our ability to execute our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, financial condition, and business.\n\u2022Entering into hedging activities may subject us to increased regulation.\n\u2022Our results could be adversely affected by counterparty credit risk.\nInternal\n\u2022We remain in outstanding litigation with one of the holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries A Shares\u201d) related to their purported notices under the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Shares (the \u201cCertificate\u201d) to redeem an aggregate of $144.2 million liquidation preference of our Series A Shares in March 2020. If we are required to pay damages or redeem a portion of their Series A Shares, it could materially and adversely affect our ongoing business and liquidity.\n\u2022We are subject to the risks of securities laws liability and related civil litigation.\n\u2022An unidentified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\n\u2022We may become subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, which would limit our business operations and require us to spend significant resources to comply with such act.\n\u2022Failure to retain the tax benefits provided by the USVI would adversely affect our financial performance.\n\u2022Our USVI operations may become subject to United States federal income taxation.\n\u2022Our cash balances are held at a number of financial institutions that expose us to their credit risk.\n\u2022Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American could result in a delisting or a halt in the trading of our common stock.\n\u2022The market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR MARKET GENERALLY\nGeneral economic developments and trends and the performance of the housing, real estate, mortgage finance, and broader financial markets may adversely affect our business and the value of, and returns on, real estate-related and other assets we own or may acquire and could also negatively impact our business and financial results.\nOur level of business activity and the profitability of our business, as well as the values of, and the cash flows from, the assets we own, are affected by developments in the U.S. economy and the broader global economy. As a result, negative economic developments are likely to negatively impact our business and financial results. There are a number of factors that could contribute to negative economic developments, including, but not limited to, U.S. fiscal and monetary policy changes, including Federal Reserve policy shifts and changes in benchmark interest rates, changing U.S. consumer spending patterns, negative developments in the housing, single-family rental (SFR), multifamily, and real estate markets, rising unemployment, rising government debt levels, changing expectations for, or the occurrence of, inflation and deflation, or adverse global political and economic events, such as the outbreak of pandemic, epidemic disease, or warfare (including the recent outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine).\nRising inflation and elevated U.S. budget deficits and overall debt levels, including as a result of federal pandemic relief and stimulus legislation and/or economic or market and supply chain conditions, can put upward pressure on interest rates and could be among the factors that could lead to higher interest rates in the future. Higher interest rates could adversely affect our overall business, income, including by reducing the fair value of many of our assets. This may affect our earnings results, reduce our ability to securitize, re-securitize, or sell our assets, or reduce our liquidity. Higher interest rates could also reduce the ability of borrowers to make interest payments or to refinance their loans.\nReal estate values, and the ability to generate returns by owning or taking credit risk on loans secured by real estate, are important to our business.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory developments and the actions of governmental authorities and entities may adversely affect our business and the value of, and the returns on, mortgages, mortgage-related securities, and other assets we own or may acquire in the future.\n(table of contents)\nAs noted above, our business is affected by conditions in the housing, business purpose, multifamily, and real estate markets and the broader financial markets, as well as by the financial condition and resources of other participants in these markets. These markets and many of the participants in these markets are subject to, or regulated under, various federal and state laws and regulations. In some cases, the government or government-sponsored entities, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, directly participate in these markets. In particular, because issues relating to residential housing and real estate finance can be areas of political focus, federal, state and local governments may be more likely to take actions that affect residential housing, the markets for financing residential housing, and the participants in residential housing-related industries than they would with respect to other industries. As a result of the government\u2019s statutory and regulatory oversight of the markets we participate in and the government\u2019s direct and indirect participation in these markets, federal and state governmental actions, policies, and directives can have an adverse effect on these markets and on our business and the value of, and the returns on, mortgages, mortgage-related securities, and other assets we own or may acquire in the future, which effects may be material.\nUltimately, we cannot assure you of the impact that governmental actions may have on our business or the financial markets and, in fact, they may adversely affect us, possibly materially. We cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur or what unintended or unanticipated impacts, if any, such actions could have on our business and financial results. Even after governmental actions have been taken and we believe we understand the impacts of those actions, prevailing interpretations may shift, or we may not be able to effectively respond to them so as to avoid a negative impact on our business or financial results.\nUnpredictability of the credit markets may restrict our access to capital and may make it difficult or impossible for us to obtain any required additional financing.\nWe intend to borrow money from lenders to fund our origination and purchase of mortgage loans. The domestic and international credit markets can be unpredictable. In the event that we need additional capital for our business, we may have a difficult time obtaining it and/or the terms upon which we can obtain it may be unfavorable, which would have an adverse impact on our financial performance.\nThe future development and growth of our crypto ATM business is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate. If the crypto business opportunities do not grow as we expect, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCrypto assets built on blockchain technology were only introduced in 2008 and remain in the early stages of development. In addition, different crypto assets are designed for different purposes. Bitcoin, for instance, was designed to serve as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, while Ethereum was designed to be a smart contract and decentralized application platform. Many other crypto networks, ranging from cloud computing to tokenized securities networks, have only recently been established. The further growth and development of any crypto assets and their underlying networks and other cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the creation, transfer, and usage of crypto assets represent a new and evolving paradigm that is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate\nWe will need to be vigilant to protect against various operational risks and technical issues that could potentially result in disabled functionalities, exposure of certain users\u2019 personal information, theft of users\u2019 assets, and other negative consequences, and which would require resolution with the attention and efforts of their global miner, user, and development communities. If any such risks or other risks materialize, and in particular if they are not resolved, the development and growth of crypto may be significantly affected and, as a result, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCryptocurrency is subject to an extensive and highly evolving regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to develop our Crypto ATM business.\nThe complexity and evolving nature of our business and the significant uncertainty surrounding the regulation of the cryptoeconomy require us to exercise our judgment as to whether certain laws, rules, and regulations apply to us, and it is possible that governmental bodies and regulators may disagree with our conclusions. To the extent we have not complied with such laws, rules, and regulations, we could be subject to significant fines, revocation of licenses, limitations on our products and services, reputational harm, and other regulatory consequences, each of which may be significant and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n(table of contents)\nOur businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created economic and financial disruptions that have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments, including the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments over the long term and against new variants, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nWhile financial markets have rebounded from the significant declines that occurred early in the pandemic and global economic conditions generally improved in 2021, certain of the circumstances that arose or became more pronounced after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic persisted in 2021, including (i) relatively weak consumer confidence; (ii) low levels of the federal funds rate and yields on U.S. Treasury securities which, at times, were near zero; (iii) higher cyber security, information security and operational risks; and (iv) interruptions in the supply chain that have adversely affected many businesses and have contributed to higher rates of inflation.\nDepending on the duration and severity of the pandemic going forward, as well as the effects of the pandemic on consumer confidence, the conditions noted above could continue for an extended period and other adverse developments may occur or reoccur, including defaults by consumers on loans and changes in consumer spending or borrowing patterns. Our ability to enter into new business, acquire new business, and grow new business has been materially impacted by COVID-19 and related governmental measures imposed to contain the virus, such as the closure of stores, restrictions on travel, quarantines or stay-at-home orders. If the disruptions caused by the pandemic continue, our ability to succeed at these new businesses could suffer materially.\nTravel restrictions, the closure of non-essential businesses or shelter-in-place/stay-at-home orders may make it more difficult and costly for our business. This extended period of remote working by our employees may introduce operational risks, including technology availability and heightened cybersecurity risk. Remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our data security, data privacy, investor reporting and business continuity processes could be impacted by a third party\u2019s inability to perform due to COVID-19 or by failures of, or attacks on, their information systems and technology. Our accounting and financial reporting systems, processes, and controls could be impacted as a result of these risks.\nGovernmental authorities worldwide have taken increased measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The continued success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to address future market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nWe may not be successful in entering into new businesses and markets, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur new strategy focuses on the purchase and origination of mortgage loans. Given our focus across the real estate industry, these initiatives could increase our costs and expose us to new market risks and legal and regulatory requirements. These loans have different economic structures than our previous businesses and will require different strategies and policies and procedures. These activities also may impose additional compliance burdens on us, subject us to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and expose us to greater reputation and litigation risk.\nThe success of our growth strategy will depend on, among other things:\n\u2022Our ability to correctly originate and purchase mortgage loans that appeal to end investors;\n\u2022The diversion of management\u2019s time and attention into the growth of such new businesses;\n\u2022Management\u2019s ability to spend time developing and integrating the new business and the success of the integration effort;\n\u2022Our ability to identify and manage risks in new lines of businesses;\n\u2022Our ability to obtain requisite approvals and licenses from the relevant governmental authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations without incurring undue costs and delays; and\n\u2022Our ability to successfully negotiate and enter into beneficial arrangements with our counterparties.\n(table of contents)\nWe are also entering into a new Crypto ATM business. We may not be successful in this new business and even if we do succeed in creating revenues in these businesses, they may not be profitable.\nIn some instances, we may determine that growth in a specific area is best achieved through the acquisition of an existing business or a smaller scale lift out of an origination team to enhance our platform. Our ability to consummate an acquisition will depend on our ability to identify and value potential acquisition opportunities accurately and successfully compete for these businesses against companies that may have greater financial resources. Even if we are able to identify and successfully negotiate and complete an acquisition, these transactions can be complex and we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs.\nIn addition, if a new business or venture developed internally or by acquisition is unsuccessful, we may decide to wind down, liquidate and/or discontinue it. Such actions could negatively impact our relationships with our counterparties in those businesses, could subject us to litigation or regulatory inquiries and can expose us to additional expenses, including impairment charges.\nOur use of leverage may expose us to substantial risks.\nWe intend to use indebtedness as a means to finance our future business operations, which will expose us to the risks associated with using leverage. We are dependent on financial institutions extending credit to us on reasonable terms to finance our new business. There is no guarantee that such institutions will extend credit to us or that we will be able to refinance any new obligations when they mature. As borrowings under any future credit facility or any other indebtedness mature, we may be required to either refinance them by entering into a new facility or issuing additional debt, which could result in higher borrowing costs, or issuing additional equity, which would dilute existing stockholders. We could also repay them by using cash on hand, cash provided by our continuing operations or cash from the sale of our assets, which could reduce dividends to our stockholders. We could have difficulty entering into new facilities or issuing debt or equity securities in the future on attractive terms, or at all.\nOperational risks, including those associated with our business model, may disrupt our businesses, result in losses or limit our growth.\nWe rely heavily on our financial, accounting, information and other data processing systems. We may face various security threats, including cyber security threats to and attacks on our information technology infrastructure that are intended to gain access to our proprietary information, destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage our systems. These security threats could originate from a wide variety of sources, including unknown third parties outside the company.\nThere may be an increase in the frequency and sophistication of the cyber and security threats we face, with attacks ranging from those common to businesses generally to those that are more advanced and persistent, which may target us because, as an alternative lender, we hold an amount of confidential and sensitive information about our borrowers, our portfolio companies and potential investments. As a result, we may face a heightened risk of a security breach, online extortion attempt, or disruption with respect to this information resulting from an attack by computer hackers, foreign governments, cyber extortionists or cyber terrorists. If successful, these types of attacks on our network or other systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, due to, among other things, the loss of investor or proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business and damage to our reputation. Our suppliers, contractors, investors, and other third parties with whom we do business also experience cyber threats and attacks that are similar in frequency and sophistication. In many cases, we have to rely on the controls and safeguards put in place by our suppliers, contractors, investors and other third parties to defend against, respond to, and report these attacks.\nWe depend on key personnel to manage our business, and the loss of any key person\u2019s services, combined with our inability to identify and retain a suitable replacement for such person, could materially adversely affect us. Additionally, the cost to retain our key personnel could put pressure on our operating margins.\nOur success is largely dependent on the skills, experience, and performance of our key personnel. The business acumen, expertise, and business relationships of our key personnel are critical elements in developing our new businesses. Financial services professionals are in high demand, and we face significant competition for qualified employees. The loss of services of any of our key personnel for any reason, combined with our inability to identify and retain a suitable replacement for such person, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, to retain key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation to such individuals, resulting in additional expense.\n(table of contents)\nOur inability to manage future growth effectively could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to grow will depend on our management\u2019s ability to originate and/or acquire investor real estate loans. In order to do this, we will need to identify, hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. Any failure to effectively manage our future growth, including a failure to successfully expand our loan origination activities could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to develop, enhance and implement strategies to adapt to changing conditions in the real estate and capital markets, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe manner in which we compete and the loans for which we compete are affected by changing conditions, which can take the form of trends or sudden changes in our industry, regulatory environment, changes in the role of government-sponsored entities, changes in the role of credit rating agencies or their rating criteria or process or the United States economy more generally. If we do not effectively respond to these changes, or if our strategies to respond to these changes are not successful, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INVESTING STRATEGY\nThe nature of the assets we hold and the expected investments we make could potentially expose us to credit risk that could negatively impact the value of those assets and investments, our earnings, dividends, cash flows, and access to liquidity, or otherwise negatively affect our business.\nOverview of credit risk\nWe assume credit risk primarily through the ownership of business purpose and multifamily real estate loans. Credit losses on these types of real estate loans can occur for many reasons, including: fraud; poor underwriting; poor servicing practices; weak economic conditions; increases in payments required to be made by borrowers; declines in the value of real estate; declining rents and/or elevated delinquencies associated with single- and multifamily rental housing; the outbreak of highly infectious or contagious diseases; natural disasters, the effects of climate change (including flooding, drought, wildfires, and severe weather) and other natural events; uninsured property loss; over-leveraging of the borrower; costs of remediation of environmental conditions, such as indoor mold; changes in zoning or building codes and the related costs of compliance; acts of war or terrorism; changes in legal protections for lenders and other changes in law or regulation; and personal events affecting borrowers, such as reduction in income, job loss, divorce, or health problems. In addition, the amount and timing of credit losses could be affected by loan modifications, delays in the liquidation process, documentation errors, and other action by servicers. Weakness in the U.S. economy or the housing market could cause our credit losses to increase beyond levels that we currently anticipate.\nCredit losses on business purpose and multifamily real estate loans can occur for many of the reasons noted above. Moreover, these types of real estate loans may not be fully amortizing and, therefore, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the principal when due may depend upon the ability of the borrower to refinance or sell the property at maturity. Business purpose and multifamily real estate loans and real estate loans collateralizing business purpose and multifamily securities are particularly sensitive to conditions in the rental housing market and to demand for residential rental properties.\nFor loans we own directly, we will most likely be in a position to incur credit losses - should they occur - only after losses are borne by the owner of the property (e.g., by a reduction in the owner\u2019s equity stake in the property). We may take actions available to us in an attempt to protect our position and mitigate the amount of credit losses, but these actions may not prove to be successful and could result in our increasing the amount of credit losses we ultimately incur on a loan.\nAdditionally, loans to small, privately owned businesses such as borrowers from our business purpose loan origination platforms involve a high degree of business and financial risk. Often, there is little or no publicly available information about these businesses. Accordingly, we must rely on our own due diligence to obtain information in connection with our investment decisions. A borrower\u2019s ability to repay its loan may be adversely impacted by numerous factors, including a downturn in its industry or other negative local or more general economic conditions. Deterioration in a borrower\u2019s financial condition and prospects may be accompanied by deterioration in the collateral for the loan. These factors may have an impact on loans involving such businesses, and can result in substantial losses, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n(table of contents)\nWe may have concentrated credit risk in certain geographical regions and may be disproportionately affected by an economic or housing downturn, natural disaster, terrorist event, climate change, or any other adverse event specific to those regions.\nA decline in the economy or difficulties in certain real estate markets, such as a high level of foreclosures in a particular area, are likely to cause a decline in the value of multifamily properties in that market. This, in turn, will increase the risk of delinquency, default, and foreclosure on real estate loans we may hold with properties in those regions. This may then adversely affect our credit loss experience and other aspects of our business, including our ability to securitize (or otherwise sell) real estate loans and securities.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster (such as an earthquake, tornado, hurricane, flood, landslide, or wildfire), or the effects of climate change (including flooding, drought, and severe weather), may cause decreases in the value of real estate (including sudden or abrupt changes) and would likely reduce the value of the properties collateralizing real estate loans we own. For example, in recent years, hurricanes have caused widespread flooding in Florida and Texas and wildfires and mudslides in northern and southern California have destroyed or damaged thousands of homes. Since certain natural disasters may not typically be covered by the standard hazard insurance policies maintained by borrowers, the borrowers may have to pay for repairs due to the disasters. Borrowers may not repair their property or may stop paying their mortgage loans under those circumstances, especially if the property is damaged. This would likely cause foreclosures to increase and lead to higher credit losses on our loans.\nThe timing of credit losses can harm our economic returns.\nThe timing of credit losses can be a material factor in our economic returns from real estate loans, investments, and securities. If unanticipated losses occur within the first few years after a loan is originated, those losses could have a greater negative impact on our investment returns than unanticipated losses on more seasoned loans. The timing of credit losses could be affected by the creditworthiness of the borrower, the borrower\u2019s willingness and ability to continue to make payments, and new legislation, legal actions, or programs that allow for the modification of loans or rental obligations, or ability for borrowers or tenants to get relief through forbearance, bankruptcy or other avenues.\nOur efforts to manage credit risks may fail.\nWe will attempt to manage risks of credit losses by continually evaluating our investments for impairment indicators and establishing reserves under GAAP for credit and other risks based upon our assessment of these risks. We cannot establish credit reserves for tax accounting purposes. The amount of reserves that we establish may prove to be insufficient, which would negatively impact our financial results and would result in decreased earnings. In addition, cash and other capital we hold to help us manage credit and other risks and liquidity issues may prove to be insufficient. If these increased credit losses are greater than we anticipated and we need to increase our credit reserves, our GAAP earnings might be reduced. Increased credit losses may also adversely affect our cash flows, ability to invest, asset fair values, access to short-term borrowings, and ability to finance assets.\nChanges in consumer behavior, bankruptcy laws, tax laws, regulation of the mortgage industry, and other laws may exacerbate loan or investment losses. In most cases, the value of the underlying property will be the sole effective source of funds for any recoveries. Other changes or actions by judges or legislators regarding mortgage loans and contracts, including the voiding of certain portions of these agreements, may reduce our earnings, impair our ability to mitigate losses, or increase the probability and severity of losses. Any expansion of our loss mitigation efforts could increase our operating costs and the expanded loss mitigation efforts may not reduce our future credit losses.\nMultifamily and business purpose mortgage loan borrowers that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic may not make payments of principal and interest relating to their mortgage loans on a timely basis, or at all, which could negatively impact our business.\nMultifamily and business purpose loans we are to own could be subject to similar risks as those described above and could likely be impaired, potentially materially to the extent multifamily and business purpose loan borrowers have been negatively impacted by the pandemic and do not timely remit payments of principal and interest relating to their mortgage loans. In addition, if tenants who rent their residence from a multifamily or business purpose loan borrower are unable to make rental payments, are unwilling to make rental payments, or a waiver of the requirement to make rental payments on a timely basis, or at all, is available under the terms of any applicable forbearance or waiver agreement or program (which rental payment forbearance or waiver program may be available as a result of a government-sponsored or -imposed program or under any such agreement or program a landlord may otherwise offer to tenants), then the value of multifamily and business purpose loans we\n(table of contents)\nown will likely be impaired, potentially materially. Moreover, to the extent the economic impact of any such pandemic impacts local, regional or national economic conditions, the value of multifamily and residential real estate that secures multifamily and business purpose loans is likely to decline, which would also likely negatively impact the value of mortgage loans we own, potentially materially.\nAdditionally, a significant amount of the business purpose loans that we own are short-term bridge loans that are secured by residential properties that are undergoing rehabilitation or construction and not occupied by tenants. Because these properties are generally not income producing (e.g., from rental revenue), in order to fund principal and interest payments, these borrowers may seek to renegotiate the terms of their mortgage loan, including by seeking payment forbearances, waivers, or maturity extensions as a result of being negatively impacted by the pandemic. Moreover, planned construction or rehabilitation of these properties may not be able to proceed on a timely basis or at all due to operating disruptions or government mandated moratoriums on construction, development or redevelopment. All of the foregoing factors would also likely negatively impact the value of mortgage loans we own, potentially materially.\nChanges in prepayment rates of mortgage loans could reduce our earnings, dividends, cash flows, and access to liquidity.\nThe economic returns we earn from most of the real estate loans we own are affected by the rate of prepayment of the mortgage loans. Prepayments are difficult to accurately predict and adverse changes in the rate of prepayment could reduce our cash flows, earnings, and dividends. Adverse changes in cash flows would likely reduce the fair values of many of our assets, which could reduce our ability to borrow against our assets and may cause market valuation adjustments for GAAP purposes, which could reduce our reported earnings. While we will estimate prepayment rates to determine the effective yield of our assets and valuations, these estimates are not precise and prepayment rates do not necessarily change in a predictable manner as a function of interest rate changes. Prepayment rates can change rapidly. As a result, changes can cause volatility in our financial results, affect our ability to securitize assets, affect our ability to fund acquisitions, and have other negative impacts on our ability to generate earnings.\nSome of the business purpose loans we originate or hold may allow the borrower to make prepayments without incurring a prepayment penalty and some may include provisions allowing the borrower to extend the term of the loan beyond the originally scheduled maturity. Because the decision to prepay or extend a business purpose loan is controlled by the borrower, we may not accurately anticipate the timing of these events, which could affect the earnings and cash flows we anticipate and could impact our ability to finance these assets.\nInterest rate fluctuations can have various negative effects on us and could lead to reduced earnings and increased volatility in our earnings.\nChanges in interest rates, the interrelationships between various interest rates, and interest rate volatility could have negative effects on our earnings, the fair value of our assets and liabilities, loan prepayment rates, and our access to liquidity. Changes in interest rates can also harm the credit performance of our assets. We may seek to hedge some but not all interest rate risks. Our hedging may not work effectively and we may change our hedging strategies or the degree or type of interest rate risk we assume.\nSome of the loans we may own or acquire may have adjustable-rate coupons (i.e., they may earn interest at a rate that adjusts periodically based on an interest rate index). The cash flows we receive from these assets may vary as a function of interest rates, as may the reported earnings generated by these loans. We also may acquire loans and securities for future sale, as assets we are accumulating for securitization, or as a longer-term investment. We may fund assets with a combination of equity, fixed rate debt and adjustable rate debt. To the extent we use adjustable rate debt to fund assets that have a fixed interest rate (or use fixed rate debt to fund assets that have an adjustable interest rate), an interest rate mismatch could exist and we could, for example, earn less (and fair values could decline) if interest rates rise, at least for a time. We may or may not seek to mitigate interest rate mismatches for these assets with hedges such as interest rate agreements and other derivatives and, to the extent we do use hedging techniques, they may not be successful.\nHigher interest rates generally will reduce the fair value of many of our assets. This may affect our earnings results, reduce our ability to sell our assets, or reduce our liquidity. Higher interest rates could reduce the ability of borrowers to make interest payments or to refinance their loans. Higher interest rates could reduce property values and increased credit losses could result. Higher interest rates could reduce mortgage originations, thus reducing our opportunities to acquire new assets.\nIt can be difficult to predict the impact on interest rates of unexpected and uncertain global political and economic events, such as the outbreak of pandemic or epidemic disease, warfare (including the recent outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine), economic and international trade conflicts or sanctions, the change in the U.S. presidential administration and\n(table of contents)\npolitical makeup of the Congress, or changes in the credit rating of the U.S. government; however, increased uncertainty or changes in the economic outlook for, or rating of, the creditworthiness of the U.S. government may have adverse impacts on, among other things, the U.S. economy, financial markets, the cost of borrowing, the financial strength of counterparties we transact business with, and the value of assets we hold. Any such adverse impacts could negatively impact the availability to us of short-term debt financing, our cost of short-term debt financing, our business, and our financial results.\nOur growth may be limited if assets are not available or not available at attractive prices.\nTo reinvest the proceeds from principal repayments we receive on our existing loans and deploy capital we raise, we may seek to originate, invest in, or acquire new assets. If the availability of new assets is limited, we may not be able to originate, invest in, or acquire assets that will generate attractive returns. Generally, asset supply can be reduced if originations of a particular product are reduced or if there are fewer sales in the secondary market of seasoned product from existing portfolios. In particular, assets we believe have a favorable risk/reward ratio may not be available for purchase (or origination by our business purpose loan origination platform).\nWe originate business purpose loans, but we may not be willing to provide the level of loan proceeds to the borrower or interest rate that borrowers find acceptable or that matches our competitors, which would likely reduce the volume of these types of loans that we originate.\nWe may change our investment strategy or financing plans, which may result in riskier investments and diminished returns.\nWe may change our investment strategy or financing plans at any time, which could result in our making investments that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments we are currently planning to make. A change in our investment strategy or financing plans may increase our exposure to interest rate and default risk and real estate market fluctuations. Decisions to employ additional leverage could increase the risk inherent in our investment strategy. Furthermore, a change in our investment strategy could result in our making investments in new asset categories or in different proportions among asset categories than management\u2019s current strategy. Alternatively, we could determine to change our investment strategy or financing plans to be more risk averse, resulting in potentially lower returns, which could also have an adverse effect on our financial returns.\nThe performance of the assets we own will vary and may not meet our earnings or cash flow expectations. In addition, the cash flows and earnings from, and market values of loans, we own may be volatile.\nWe seek to manage certain of the risks associated with acquiring, originating, holding, selling, and managing real estate loans. No amount of risk management or mitigation, however, can change the variable nature of the cash flows of, fair values of, and financial results generated by these loans. Changes in the credit performance of, or the prepayments on, these real estate loans, and changes in interest rates impact the cash flows on these loans, and the impact could be significant for our loans with concentrated risks. Changes in cash flows lead to changes in our return on investment and also to potential variability in and level of reported income. The revenue recognized on some of our assets is based on an estimate of the yield over the remaining life of the asset. Thus, changes in our estimates of expected cash flow from an asset will result in changes in our reported earnings on that asset in the current reporting period. We may be forced to recognize adverse changes in expected future cash flows as a current expense, further adding to earnings volatility.\nThe inability to access financial leverage through warehouse and repurchase facilities, credit facilities, or other forms of debt financing may inhibit our ability to execute our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, financial condition, and business.\nOur ability to fund our business depends on our securing warehouse, repurchase, or other forms of debt financing (or leverage) on acceptable terms. For example, pending the sale of a pool of mortgage loans we intend to generally fund those mortgage loans through borrowings from warehouse, repurchase, and credit facilities, and other forms of short-term financing.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in establishing sufficient sources of short-term debt when needed. In addition, because of its short-term nature, lenders may decline to renew our short-term debt upon maturity or expiration, and it may be difficult for us to obtain continued short-term financing. To the extent our business calls for us to access financing and counterparties are unable or unwilling to lend to us, then our business and financial results will be adversely affected. It is also possible that lenders who provide us with financing could experience changes in their ability to advance funds to us,\n(table of contents)\nindependent of our performance or the performance of our loans, in which case funds we had planned to be able to access may not be available to us.\nEntering into hedging activities may subject us to increased regulation.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, there is increased regulation of companies that enter into interest rate hedging agreements and other hedging instruments and derivatives. This increased regulation could result in us being required to register and be regulated as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor. If we are not able to maintain an exemption from these regulations, it could have a negative impact on our business or financial results. Moreover, rules requiring central clearing of certain interest rate swap and other transactions, as well as rules relating to margin and capital requirements for swap transactions and regulated participants in the swap markets, as well as other swap market regulatory reforms, may increase the cost or decrease the availability to us of hedging transactions.\nOur results could be adversely affected by counterparty credit risk.\nWe have credit risks that are generally related to the counterparties with which we do business. There is a risk that counterparties will fail to perform under their contractual arrangements with us and this risk is usually more pronounced during an economic downturn. The economic impact of the pandemic and the associated volatility in the financial markets has at times triggered, and is likely to trigger additional periods of economic slowdown or recession, and such conditions could jeopardize the solvency of counterparties with which we do business. Those risks of non-performance may differ materially from the risks entailed in exchange-traded transactions, which generally are backed by clearing organization guarantees, daily mark-to-market and settlement of positions, and segregation and minimum capital requirements applicable to intermediaries. Transactions entered into directly between parties generally do not benefit from those protections, and expose the parties to the risk of counterparty default. Furthermore, there may be practical and timing problems associated with enforcing our rights to assets in the case of an insolvency of a counterparty.\nIn the event a counterparty to our borrowings becomes insolvent, we may fail to recover the full value of our pledged collateral, thus reducing our earnings and liquidity. In addition, the insolvency of one or more of our financing counterparties could reduce the amount of financing available to us, which would make it more difficult for us to leverage the value of our assets and obtain substitute financing on attractive terms or at all. A material reduction in our financing sources or an adverse change in the terms of our financings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In the event a counterparty to our interest rate agreements or other derivatives becomes insolvent or interprets our agreements with it in a manner unfavorable to us, our ability to realize benefits from the hedge transaction may be diminished, any cash or collateral we pledged to the counterparty may be unrecoverable, and we may be forced to unwind these agreements at a loss. In the event a counterparty that sells us mortgage loans becomes insolvent or is acquired by a third party, we may be unable to enforce our loan repurchase rights in connection with a breach of loan representations and warranties and we may suffer losses if we must repurchase delinquent loans. In the event that one of our sub-servicers becomes insolvent or fails to perform, loan delinquencies and credit losses may increase and we may not receive the funds to which we are entitled. We will attempt to diversify our counterparty exposure, although we may not always be able to do so. Our counterparty risk management strategy may prove ineffective and, accordingly, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nSPECIFIC RISKS RELATING TO US\nWe remain in outstanding litigation with one of the holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries A Shares\u201d) related to their purported notices under the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Shares (the \u201cCertificate\u201d) to redeem an aggregate of $144.2 million liquidation preference of our Series A Shares in March 2020. If we are required to pay damages or redeem a portion of their Series A Shares, it could materially and adversely affect our ongoing business and liquidity.\nBetween January 31, 2020 and February 3, 2020, we received purported notices from holders of our Series A Shares requesting us to redeem an aggregate of $250.0 million liquidation preference of our Series A Shares on March 15, 2020. We did not have legally available funds to redeem all of the Series A Shares on March 15, 2020. As a result, under the terms of the Certificate, we do not believe that we are obligated to redeem any of the Series A Shares under the Certificate, and, consistent with the exclusive forum provisions of our Third Amended and Restated Bylaws, we have filed a claim for declaratory relief in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Croix, against Luxor Capital Group, LP and certain of its funds and managed accounts (collectively, \u201cLuxor\u201d) to confirm our interpretation of the Certificate. On February 3, 2020, Luxor filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, against AAMC for breach of contract, specific performance, unjust enrichment, and related damages and expenses. AAMC intends to continue to pursue its strategic business\n(table of contents)\ninitiatives despite this litigation. See \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d If Luxor were to prevail in its lawsuit, we may need to cease or curtail our business initiatives, and our liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. For more information on the legal proceedings with Luxor, see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are subject to the risks of securities laws liability and related civil litigation.\nWe may be subject to risk of securities litigation and derivative actions from time to time as a result of being publicly traded, including the actions set forth in \u201cNote 7-Commitments and contingencies.\u201d There can be no assurance that any settlement or liabilities in any future lawsuits or claims against us would be covered or partially covered by our insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in one or more periods. The range of possible resolutions for any potential legal actions could include determinations and judgments against us or settlements that could require substantial payments by us, including the costs of defending such suits, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAn unidentified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. There can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not arise in the future or that any remediation efforts will be successful. If additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls are discovered in the future, we could be required to restate our financial results or experience a decline in the price of our securities. Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.\nWe may become subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, which would limit our business operations and require us to spend significant resources to comply with such act.\nThe Investment Company Act defines an \u201cinvestment company\u201d as an issuer that is engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the issuer's unconsolidated assets, excluding cash items and securities issued by the federal government. While the Investment Company Act also has several exclusions and exceptions that we would seek to rely upon to avoid being deemed an investment company, our reliance on any such exclusions or exceptions may be misplaced resulting in violation of the Investment Company Act, the consequences of which can be significant.\nThe ramifications of becoming an investment company, both in terms of the restrictions it would have on us and the cost of compliance, would be significant. For example, in addition to expenses related to initially registering as an investment company, the Investment Company Act also imposes various restrictions with regard to our ability to enter into affiliated transactions, the diversification of our assets and our ability to borrow money. If we became subject to the Investment Company Act at some point in the future, our ability to continue pursuing our business plan would be severely limited\nFailure to retain the tax benefits provided by the USVI would adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the USVI and are headquartered in the USVI. The USVI has an Economic Development Commission (the \u201cEDC\u201d) that provides benefits (\u201cEDC Benefits\u201d) to certain qualified businesses in the USVI that enable us to avail ourselves of significant tax benefits for a thirty-year period. We received our certificate to operate as a company that qualifies for EDC Benefits as of February 1, 2013, which provides us with a 90% tax credit on USVI-source income so long as we comply with the requirements of the EDC and our certificate of benefits. It is possible that we may not be able to retain our qualifications for the EDC Benefits or that changes in U.S. federal, state, local or USVI taxation statutes or applicable regulations may cause a reduction in or an elimination of the EDC Benefits, all of which could result in a significant increase to our tax expense, and, therefore, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n(table of contents)\nOur USVI operations may become subject to United States federal income taxation.\nOur parent company is incorporated under the laws of the USVI and intends to operate in a manner that will cause us to be treated as not engaging in a trade or business within the United States, which will cause us to be exempt from current United States federal income taxation on our net income. However, because there are no definitive standards provided by the Code, regulations or court decisions as to the specific activities that constitute being engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, and as any such determination is essentially factual in nature, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not successfully assert that we are engaged in a trade or business within the United States.\nIf the IRS were to successfully assert that we have been engaged in a trade or business within the United States in any taxable year, various adverse tax consequences could result, including the following:\n\u2022We may become subject to current United States federal income taxation on our net income from sources within the United States;\n\u2022We may be subject to United States federal income tax on a portion of our net investment income, regardless of its source;\n\u2022We may not be entitled to deduct certain expenses that would otherwise be deductible from the income subject to United States taxation; and\n\u2022We may be subject to United States branch profits tax on profits deemed to have been distributed out of the United States.\nUnited States persons who own shares may be subject to United States federal income taxation on our undistributed earnings and may recognize ordinary income upon disposition of shares.\nSignificant potential adverse United States federal income tax consequences generally apply to any United States person who owns shares in a passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d). We cannot provide assurance that we will not be a PFIC in any future taxable year.\nIn general, we would be a PFIC for a taxable year if either (i) 75% or more of our income constitutes \u201cpassive income\u201d or (ii) 50% or more of our assets produce \u201cpassive income.\u201d Passive income generally includes interest, dividends and other investment income. We believe that we are currently operating, and intend to continue operating, our business in a way that should not cause us to be a deemed PFIC; however, we cannot assure you the IRS will not successfully challenge this conclusion.\nUnited States persons who, directly or indirectly or through attribution rules, own 10% or more of our shares (\u201cUnited States 10% Stockholders\u201d), based on either voting power or value, may be subject to the controlled foreign corporation (\u201cCFC\u201d) rules. Under the CFC rules, each United States 10% stockholder must annually include his pro rata share of the CFC's \u201cSubpart F income,\u201d even if no distributions are made. Also, all capital gains from the sale of PFIC shares will be treated as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes and thus are not eligible for preferential long-term capital gains rates.\nWe believe that the dispersion of our ordinary shares among holders will generally prevent new stockholders who acquire shares from being United States 10% Stockholders. We cannot assure you, however, that these rules will not apply to you. If you are a United States person, we strongly urge you to consult your own tax adviser concerning the CFC rules.\nUnited States tax-exempt organizations who own shares may recognize unrelated business taxable income.\nIf you are a United States tax-exempt organization, you may recognize unrelated business taxable income with respect to our insurance-related income if a portion of our Subpart F income is allocated to you. In general, Subpart F income will be allocated to you if we are a CFC and you are a United States 10% Stockholder and certain exceptions do not apply. Although we do not believe that any United States persons will be allocated Subpart F income, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. If you are a United States tax-exempt organization, we advise you to consult your own tax adviser regarding the risk of recognizing unrelated business taxable income.\n(table of contents)\nWe may in the future become subject to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income provisions.\nThe Tax Cuts and Job Reform Act requires U.S. stockholders of CFCs to include in income, as a deemed dividend, the global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) of the CFCs. The GILTI regime is designed to decrease the incentive for a U.S. group to shift corporate profits to low-taxed jurisdictions. We are not currently impacted by the GILTI provisions, as the entirety of the aggregate net income for each of our CFCs is excluded from our \u201cnet tested income\u201d (the basis on which the tax is calculated), as it constitutes Subpart F income and is subject to an effective foreign tax rate greater than 90% of the maximum U.S. corporate income tax rate. We cannot rule out the possibility that we will in the future find ourselves subject to the GILTI rules, should the income of our CFCs no longer be entirely Subpart F income and be taxed at a foreign tax rate greater than 90% if the U.S. corporate income tax rate.\nChanges to U.S. or state tax laws, our failure to adequately comply with U.S. or state tax laws, or the outcome of any audits or regulatory disputes with respect to our compliance with U.S. or state tax laws could adversely affect us.\nChanges to U.S. or state tax law could be enacted in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, we are subject to potential tax audits in various jurisdictions and in such event, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess penalties or additional taxes. While we assess the likely outcomes of these potential audits, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of a potential audit, and an audit could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nChange in United States tax laws may be retroactive and could subject us and/or United States persons who own shares to United States income taxation on our undistributed earnings.\nThe tax laws and interpretations regarding whether we are engaged in a United States trade or business, are a CFC or a PFIC are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. New regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying such rules may be forthcoming from the IRS. We are not able to predict if, when or in what form such guidance will be provided and whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect.\nThe impact of the initiative of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in the United States Virgin Islands.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non-member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition. These measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world. While the USVI is currently a jurisdiction that has substantially implemented internationally agreed tax standards, we are not able to predict if additional requirements will be imposed and, if so, whether changes arising from such additional requirements will subject us to additional taxes.\nOur cash balances are held at a number of financial institutions that expose us to their credit risk\nWe maintain our cash and cash equivalents at financial or other intermediary institutions. The combined account balances at each institution typically exceed FDIC insurance coverage of $250,000 per depositor, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. At December 31, 2021, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalent balances held at financial institutions exceeded FDIC insured limits.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American could result in a delisting or a halt in the trading of our common stock.\nWe must continue to satisfy the NYSE American\u2019s continued listing requirements. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American, the NYSE American may take steps to delist our common stock or halt the trading of our common stock. Such a delisting or trading halt would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair a shareholder's ability to sell or purchase our common stock when they wish to do so. We cannot assure the shareholders that we will continue to meet the existing listing requirements of the NYSE American because some of the requirements, like the number of shareholders and the trading price of our common stock, are outside of our control.\nOn November 30, 2021, the NYSE American halted trading in our common stock. Although the NYSE American allowed trading to resume on March 21, 2022, shareholders were unable to trade our common stock while the trading halt was in place. Any further trading halt would prevent shareholders from selling the stock until the trading halt is lifted and the trading price may be adversely affected if trading in the stock begins again.\n(table of contents)\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.\nThe price at which our common stock trades has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, significantly. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to many things, including but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Variations in actual or anticipated results of our operations, liquidity or financial condition;\n\u2022Changes in, or the failure to meet, our financial estimates or those of by securities analysts;\n\u2022Actions or announcements by our competitors;\n\u2022Potential conflicts of interest, or the discontinuance of our strategic relationships;\n\u2022Actual or anticipated accounting problems;\n\u2022Regulatory actions;\n\u2022Lack of liquidity;\n\u2022An inability to develop or obtain new businesses or client relationships, respectively;\n\u2022Changes in the market outlook for the real estate, mortgage or housing markets;\n\u2022Technology changes in our business;\n\u2022Changes in interest rates that lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher yield;\n\u2022Actions by our stockholders;\n\u2022Speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022General market, economic and political conditions, including an economic slowdown or dislocation in the global credit markets;\n\u2022Failure to maintain the listing of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") American;\n\u2022Changes in accounting principles;\n\u2022Passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry; and\n\u2022Departure of our key personnel.\nThe market prices of securities of alternative lenders have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of these companies. These market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nFurthermore, our small size and different investment characteristics may not continue to appeal to our current investor base that may seek to dispose of large amounts of our common stock. There is no assurance that there will be sufficient buying interest to offset those sales, and, accordingly, the market price of our common stock could be depressed and/or experience periods of high volatility.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT AND OUR RELATIONSHIPS\nOur Directors have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as ours.\nOur Directors may have other investments and business activities in addition to their interest in, and responsibilities to, us. Under the provisions of our Charter and our bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d), our Directors have no duty to abstain from exercising the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as ours or employ or otherwise engage any of the other Directors. If any of our Directors who are also directors, officers or employees of any company acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity outside of his capacity as one of our Directors, then our Bylaws provide that such Director will be permitted to pursue that corporate opportunity independently of us, so long as the Director has acted in good faith. Our Bylaws provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such a Director will be deemed to have satisfied his fiduciary duties to us and will not be liable to us for pursuing such a corporate opportunity independently of us. This may create conflicts of interest between us and certain of our Directors and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our stockholders. As of this date, none of our Directors is directly involved as a director, officer or employee of a business that competes with us, but there can be no assurance that will remain unchanged in the future.", "PERMNO": 14127, "SIC": 6500, "TIC": "AAMC"}
