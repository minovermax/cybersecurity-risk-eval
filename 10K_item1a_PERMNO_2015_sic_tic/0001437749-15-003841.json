{"cik": "216539", "company": "MEDIA GENERAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nThe integration of Legacy Media General and Young and of Media General and LIN Media present significant challenges that may reduce the anticipated potential benefits of these mergers.\nThe integration of Legacy Media General and Young and the integration of Media General and LIN present significant challenges that may reduce the anticipated potential benefits of these mergers. The integration of Legacy Media General and Young and the integration of Media General and LIN is complex and time-consuming due to the size and complexity of each organization. The Company faces significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating organizations, procedures and operations in a timely and efficient manner, as well as retaining key personnel. The principal challenges include the following:\n\u25cf\nintegrating information systems and internal controls over accounting and financial reporting;\n\u25cf\nintegrating Legacy Media General and Young\u2019s and Media General and LIN\u2019s existing businesses;\n\u25cf\npreserving significant business relationships;\n\u25cf\nconsolidating corporate and administrative functions;\n\u25cf\nconforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between Legacy Media General and Young and Media General and LIN; and\n\u25cf\nretaining key employees.\nThe Company\u2019s management is dedicating substantial effort to integrating the businesses of Legacy Media General and Young and Media General and LIN. These efforts could divert management\u2019s focus and resources from the Company\u2019s business, corporate initiatives or strategic opportunities. If the Company is unable to integrate Legacy Media General\u2019s and Young\u2019s and Media General\u2019s and LIN\u2019s organizations, procedures and operations in a timely and efficient manner, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of these mergers may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of these mergers, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could also have an adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s revenues, expenses and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated.\nThe Company\u2019s advertising revenue can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. This volatility may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company relies on sales of advertising time for most of its revenues and, as a result, its operating results depend on the amount of advertising revenue that it generates. In 2014, approximately 73% of the Company\u2019s gross operating revenues were derived from broadcast advertising. If the Company generates less advertising revenue, it may be more difficult for it to repay its indebtedness and meet its working capital requirements, and the value of the Company\u2019s business may decline. The Company\u2019s ability to sell advertising depends on:\n\u25cf\nthe levels of automobile advertising, which historically have represented approximately 26% of its gross advertising revenue;\n\u25cf\nthe health of the economy in the areas where the Company\u2019s television stations are located and in the nation as a whole;\n\u25cf\nthe popularity of the Company\u2019s programming and that of its competition;\n\u25cf\nthe activities of the Company\u2019s competitors, including competitors that offer other forms of advertising-based mediums, such as other broadcast television stations, radio stations, MVPDs, Internet and broadband content providers, transit advertising, direct mail, local cable systems and other print and media outlets serving in the same markets;\n\u25cf\nthe levels of political advertising, which are affected by campaign finance laws, and the ability of political candidates and political action committees to raise and spend funds, and are subject to seasonal fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nthe levels of advertising from the Olympic Games;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the makeup of the population in the areas where the Company\u2019s stations are located; and\n\u25cf\nother factors that may be beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nIn addition, a high percentage of the Company\u2019s operating expenses are fixed, and a small decrease in advertising revenue could significantly impact its financial results. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s advertising revenue will not be volatile in the future, and such volatility may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s substantial indebtedness could impair its financial condition and its ability to fulfill its debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had total long-term debt of approximately $2.4 billion, with $146.6 million of unused commitments under the Company\u2019s Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to $3.4 million of outstanding (but undrawn) letters of credit. This indebtedness could:\n\u25cf\nmake it more difficult for the Company to satisfy its debt obligations which could in turn result in an event of default on its indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nimpair the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf\nrequire a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s cash flows to be dedicated to make debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf\nexpose the Company to the risk of increased rates as certain of its borrowings, including borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u25cf\ndiminish the Company\u2019s ability to withstand a downturn in its business, the industry in which it operates or the economy generally;\n\u25cf\nlimit flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the Company\u2019s business and the industry in which it operates; and\n\u25cf\nplace the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to certain competitors that may have lower leverage.\nIn addition, the Indentures governing LIN Television\u2019s 6.375% Senior Notes due 2021 (the \u201c2021 Notes\u201d) and LIN Television\u2019s 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \u201c2022 Notes\u201d) and the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit the ability of the Company (in the case of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and LIN Television and its subsidiaries to engage in activities that may be in the Company\u2019s long-term best interest. Failure to comply with those covenants could result in the acceleration of all of the Company\u2019s debt.\nDespite the Company\u2019s level of indebtedness, the Company may still be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could increase the risks described above.\nThe Company may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indentures governing the 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes limit, but do not prohibit, the Company or LIN Television and its subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, the Company\u2019s Revolving Credit Facility provided for unused commitments of $146.6 million (after giving effect to $3.4 million of outstanding (but undrawn) letters of credit). If the Company incurs additional indebtedness, the risks described in this report relating to having substantial debt could intensify.\nThe Company will require a significant amount of cash to service its indebtedness. This cash may not be readily available to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, its indebtedness and fund its ongoing operations and planned capital expenditures will depend largely upon the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating performance. The Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control. The Company cannot be certain that sufficient cash flow from operations will be generated or that future sources of capital will be available in amounts sufficient to enable the Company to pay the principal, premium, if any, interest on, and fees related to its indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIf the Company\u2019s cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, the Company could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness. The Company may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not be sufficient to allow the Company to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. The Company\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance its indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and the Company\u2019s financial condition at that time. Any refinancing of the Company\u2019s indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict its business operations. The credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indentures governing the 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes restrict the ability of the Company (in the case of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and LIN Television and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict the ability of the Company and LIN Television and its subsidiaries to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. The Company may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. The Company\u2019s inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy its debt obligations, or to refinance its indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially adversely affect its financial position and results of operations and may restrict the Company\u2019s current and future operations.\nIf the Company cannot make scheduled payments on its debt, it will be in default and holders of the 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money and declare all outstanding principal, interest and other amounts owing to be due and payable, require that certain obligations be cash collateralized and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and the Company could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nCovenants in the Company\u2019s debt agreements restrict our business in many ways.\nThe Indentures governing the 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes and the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company (in the case of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and LIN Television and its subsidiaries and may limit the Company\u2019s ability to engage in acts that may be in the Company\u2019s long-term best interest, including restrictions on the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nincur or assume liens or additional debt or guarantee debt or other obligations;\n\u25cf\nissue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n\u25cf\npay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u25cf\nprepay, redeem or repurchase debt;\n\u25cf\nmake loans, investments and capital expenditures;\n\u25cf\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions from the Company\u2019s subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\nsell assets and capital stock of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u25cf\nconsolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets to, another person.\nA breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the Indentures governing the 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes and the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness and could cross default to other indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit under those facilities. If the Company were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the lenders thereunder could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. The Company has pledged a significant portion of its assets as collateral under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. If the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or note holders under indentures accelerate the repayment of the Company\u2019s borrowings, the Company may not have sufficient liquidity to repay its indebtedness and could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nAs a result of these restrictions, the Company may be:\n\u25cf\nlimited in how it conducts its business;\n\u25cf\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u25cf\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions may affect the Company\u2019s ability to grow in accordance with its strategy. In addition, the Company\u2019s financial results, substantial indebtedness and credit ratings could materially adversely affect the availability and terms of its financing.\nFinancial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s industry, business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nFinancial and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Poor economic and industry conditions could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s industry or the industry of those customers who advertise on the Company\u2019s stations, including, among others, the automotive industry and service businesses, each of which is a significant source of its advertising revenue. Additionally, financial institutions, capital providers or other consumers may be adversely affected. Potential consequences of any financial and economic decline include:\n\u25cf\nthe financial condition of those companies that advertise on the Company\u2019s stations may be adversely affected, causing them to spend less on advertising, which could result in a significant decline in its advertising revenue;\n\u25cf\nthe Company\u2019s ability to pursue acquisitions or divestitures of certain television and non-television assets at attractive values may be limited;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that the Company\u2019s business partners could be negatively impacted and the Company\u2019s ability to maintain these business relationships could also be impaired;\n\u25cf\nthe Company\u2019s ability to refinance its existing debt on terms and at interest rates it finds attractive, if at all, may be impaired; and\n\u25cf\nthe Company\u2019s ability to make certain capital expenditures may be significantly impaired.\nIf the Company is unable to secure or maintain carriage of its television stations\u2019 signals over cable, telecommunication video and/or direct broadcast satellite systems, the Company\u2019s television stations may not be able to compete effectively.\nPursuant to FCC rules, local television stations may elect every three years to either: (1) require cable and/or direct broadcast satellite operators to carry the stations\u2019 signals or (2) enter into retransmission consent agreements for carriage. Failure to reach timely retransmission consent agreements with the relevant operators may harm the Company\u2019s business. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to agree on acceptable terms, which could lead to a reduction in its revenue from cable and satellite retransmission consent agreements. If the Company is unable to reach retransmission consent agreements with cable companies, satellite providers and telecommunication providers for the carriage of its stations\u2019 signals, the Company could lose revenues and audience share. The Company renegotiates retransmission agreements with cable and satellite providers as current contracts expire, and the Company may not be able to negotiate future agreements on terms comparable to or more favorable than its current agreements. This may cause revenues and revenue growth from its retransmission consent agreements to decrease under the renegotiated terms.\nEffective June 18, 2014, the FCC changed its rules implementing the statutory duty to negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith. With this change, a television broadcast station ranked among the top-four stations (as measured by audience share) in its Nielsen DMA is prohibited from negotiating retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. Under the rule changes, top-four stations may not delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to another non-commonly owned top-four station located in the same DMA or to a third party that negotiates on behalf of another top-four television station in the same DMA; neither may top-four stations facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms among multiple top-four stations in the same DMA, including through the sharing of information. Retransmission consent agreements jointly negotiated prior to the effective date of the new rules remain enforceable until expiration of their terms, but contractual provisions related to separately owned top-four stations consulting or jointly negotiating retransmission agreements are no longer enforceable. The Company cannot predict what effect, if any, the new rules may have on future negotiations for retransmission consent agreements.\nAs a television broadcaster, the Company is highly regulated, and continuation of its operations requires that it retain or renew a variety of government approvals and comply with changing federal regulations.\nThe FCC extensively regulates the ownership, operation and sale of broadcast television stations, including those licensed to the Company. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest. Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands; determines stations\u2019 locations and operating parameters; issues, renews, revokes and modifies station licenses; regulates and limits changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; regulates station employment practices; regulates certain program content and commercial matters in children\u2019s programming; has the authority to impose penalties for violations of its rules or the Communications Act; and imposes annual fees on stations. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, as well as to the FCC\u2019s rules, public notices and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast television stations.\nCongress and the FCC have under consideration, and in the future may adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, ownership transferability and profitability of the Company\u2019s television stations and affect the ability of the Company to acquire additional stations. In addition to the matters noted above, these may include, for example, spectrum use fees; reallocation of portions of the television broadcast spectrum to other uses or reductions in the amount of spectrum allotted to television stations; further restrictions on the ability of same-market television stations to engage in shared services, joint sales or other cooperative arrangements to reduce operating costs; political advertising rates; potential restrictions on the advertising of certain products (such as alcoholic beverages); program content; increased fines for rule violations; closed captioning requirements and ownership rule changes.\nUnder an order that the FCC released on April 15, 2014, a television broadcaster that agrees to sell more than 15% of the weekly advertising inventory on another television station in the same market will be deemed to have an attributable ownership interest in that station. The change effectively bans JSAs involving ad sales in excess of 15% of the weekly advertising inventory on another television station in the same market unless the brokering station could own the brokered station under the FCC\u2019s duopoly limitations or obtains a waiver of the rule. Stations with JSAs that would put them in violation of the new rules have until December 19, 2016, to amend or terminate those arrangements or to obtain waivers. Although the FCC will consider waivers of the new JSA attribution rule, the FCC thus far has provided little guidance on what factors must be present for grant of a waiver. These proposed changes will affect Media General\u2019s present agreements to sell advertising inventory for independently owned stations in Augusta, GA; Albany, NY; Lansing, MI; Springfield, OH; Youngstown, OH; and Topeka, KS. The FCC is considering in its ongoing quadrennial review of its ownership rules, and in a separate rulemaking proceeding, whether to require disclosure of or otherwise restrict shared services, news sharing and other cooperative agreements among stations. The Company has shared services agreements in the Albuquerque, NM market and in those markets where its stations sell advertising for independently owned stations (Augusta, GA; Albany, NY; Lansing, MI; Springfield, OH; Youngstown, OH; and Topeka, KS).\nIn addition, uncertainty about media ownership regulations and adverse economic conditions has dampened the acquisition market from time to time, and changes in the regulatory approval process may make it materially more expensive, or may materially delay, the Company\u2019s ability to consummate further acquisitions.\nThe Company requires licenses from the FCC for its operations, and a rejection or reconsideration of license renewals by the FCC could have a material, adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Typically, the FCC begins processing renewal applications over the last month of the renewal term; however, for broadcasters to obtain license renewals (a necessary prerequisite to FCC consent for certain transactions), the FCC has required licensees to enter into tolling agreements extending the time that the FCC may prosecute indecency and other alleged violations beyond the date of the license renewals. The Company has entered into tolling agreements with the FCC, including tolling agreements in connection with the Company\u2019s obtaining FCC consent for the merger with Young, consummated in 2013. The Company filed all of its pending applications for renewal in a timely manner prior to the applicable expiration dates and expects applications that remain pending to be approved as the FCC works through its backlog. In these circumstances, the Communications Act provides that the Company may continue to operate under its broadcast licenses pending final action on any pending renewal applications. Historically, the FCC renews the vast majority of broadcast licenses, but there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s licenses will be renewed at their expiration dates or, if renewed, that the renewal terms will be for the maximum permitted period. The non-renewal or revocation of one or more of the Company\u2019s primary licenses could have an adverse effect on its operations.\nThe FCC is considering possible mechanisms for spectrum reallocation that could affect the spectrum for the Company\u2019s stations and adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to compete.\nThe FCC is authorized to conduct a \u201creverse auction\u201d at which television broadcast licensees could submit bids to receive compensation for relinquishing all or a portion of their rights in the television spectrum of their full-service and Class A stations. A licensee could bid to relinquish its channel entirely, relocate to a different channel band (UHF to VHF), or relinquish its channel and share a different channel with another broadcaster. Broadcasters choosing to share a channel would retain must-carry rights on cable systems. Under the law, the FCC may hold only one reverse auction. Concurrently with the reverse auction or after its completion, the FCC would conduct a forward auction of the newly freed spectrum. The FCC must complete both auction by 2022.\nEven if a television licensee does not participate in the reverse auction, the FCC nevertheless may require that it relocate its station to another channel or make technical changes to facilitate repacking the band. The FCC will have a $1.75 billion fund to compensate broadcasters and cable systems for the reasonable costs of repacking. The legislation limits the ability of broadcasters to challenge FCC repacking decisions by denying a licensee the right to a hearing before the FCC modifies its license, a right that the Communications Act otherwise would provide. On June 2, 2014, the FCC released an order adopting rules to implement the broadcast television spectrum incentive auction to clear a portion of the television band for mobile broadband use. The FCC has not yet set a date for the auction, but it is anticipated that auction applications will be due at the earliest in late 2015, with the auction to be scheduled for 2016. There is no assurance however, that the FCC will meet this schedule. Changes in FCC and Administration policies and Congressional action could affect this schedule and the ultimate shape of the auction in ways that cannot now be predicted.\nThe Company further cannot predict the form of any final rules that the FCC may adopt for television spectrum reallocation or whether the rules ultimately adopted would have any adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s ability to compete. Additionally, the Company cannot predict whether the FCC or the Congress might adopt even more stringent requirements or incentives to abandon current spectrum if the initiatives now being reviewed are adopted and implemented but do not have the desired result of freeing what the agency deems to be sufficient spectrum for wireless broadband use.\nChanges in FCC ownership rules through FCC action, judicial review or federal legislation may limit the Company\u2019s ability to continue providing services to stations under sharing arrangements (such as LMAs, JSAs, SSAs and other similar agreements), may require the Company to amend or terminate certain agreements and/or may preclude the Company from obtaining the full economic value of one or more of its station combinations in a DMA upon a sale, merger or other similar transaction transferring ownership of such station or stations.\nFCC ownership rules currently impose significant limitations on the ability of a person or entity to have attributable interests in multiple media properties. Federal law prohibits any person or entity from having an attributable interest in broadcast television stations located in markets which collectively include more than 39% of national television households. The FCC is currently considering elimination of the 50% household discount given to owners of UHF stations in determining compliance with this national cap. While the Company has significant room for additional station acquisitions even if the UHF discount is eliminated, the proposed change, if adopted, could ultimately limit the company\u2019s ability to acquire television stations in additional markets. While this rulemaking is pending, the FCC has indicated it will not grant applications that would put the applicant above the 39% cap without application of the UHF discount.\nOwnership restrictions under FCC rules also include a variety of local limits on media ownership. The restrictions include an ownership limit of one television station in most medium and smaller television markets and two stations in most larger markets, known as the television duopoly rule. The regulations also include limits on the common ownership of a newspaper and television station in the same market (newspaper-television cross-ownership), and limits on common ownership of radio and television stations in the same market (radio-television station ownership).\nIf the FCC should loosen its media ownership rules, attractive opportunities may arise for additional television station and other media acquisitions, but these changes also would create additional competition for the Company from other entities, such as national broadcast networks, other large station groups, and newspaper chains, which may be better positioned to take advantage of such changes and benefit from the resulting operating synergies both nationally and in specific markets.\nOn March 12, 2014, the FCC issued a public notice with respect to the processing of broadcast television applications proposing sharing arrangements and contingent interests. The public notice indicated that the FCC will closely scrutinize any application that proposes that two or more stations in the same market that are not commonly owned (i) enter into an agreement to share facilities, employees and/or services or to jointly acquire programming or sell advertising including through joint sales agreements, shared services agreements, or similar agreements, and (ii) enter into an option, right of first refusal, put/call arrangement or other similar contingent interest, or a loan guarantee. The Company cannot now predict what actions the FCC may require in connection with the processing of applications for FCC consent to acquire or divest stations. However, among other things, this may limit the Company\u2019s ability to enter into contractual relationships with third-party licensees.\nUnder an FCC rule that became effective on June 19, 2014, a television licensee that agrees to sell more than 15% of the weekly advertising inventory of another television station in the same DMA will be deemed to have an attributable ownership interest in that station. The change will effectively ban joint sales agreements involving ad sales in excess of 15% between two stations in the same market unless the station selling the advertising time could own the other station under the FCC\u2019s duopoly limitations or can obtain a waiver of the rule. Stations with joint sales agreements that would put them in violation of the FCC\u2019s new ownership limits will have until December 19, 2016, to amend or terminate those arrangements or to obtain waivers of the new rule. Although the FCC will consider waivers of the new joint sales agreement attribution rule, the FCC thus far has provided little guidance on what factors must be present for a waiver to be granted. Absent further developments of the grant of waivers, these changes will affect the Company\u2019s present agreements to sell advertising inventory for independently owned stations in Augusta, GA, Albany, NY, Lansing, MI, Dayton, OH, Youngstown, OH and Topeka, KS, and will restrict its ability to enter such agreements in the future.\nConcurrent with its adoption of the rule on TV joint sales agreements, the FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in which it initiated its statutorily-required Quadrennial Review of its ownership rules. The rulemaking proposes, among other things, (i) eliminating the newspaper/radio cross ownership rule and the radio/television cross ownership rule, (ii) retaining the newspaper/television cross ownership rule but allowing for waivers on a case by case basis, (iii) retaining the local television rules, and (iv) prohibiting two television stations in the same market from swapping network affiliations if it would result in a single owner having two top-four network affiliations in a market where it could not otherwise own both affiliation-swapping stations. The proposed rulemaking also seeks comment on how to define a television shared services agreement and whether television stations should be required to disclose shared services agreements and how best to achieve disclosure. In addition, the FCC proposed to adopt the overlap of digital noise-limited service contours as the trigger for applying the local television ownership rules to commonly owned television stations in the same market and to grandfather existing ownership combinations that would exceed ownership limits under the revised approach.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results are dependent in part on the success of programming aired by the Company\u2019s television stations, which depends in part upon factors beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nThe Company\u2019s advertising revenues depend in part on the success of the Company\u2019s local, network and syndicated programming. The Company makes significant commitments to acquire rights to television programs under multi-year agreements. Whether these programs succeed depends upon unpredictable factors such as audience preferences, competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities. If a particular program is not popular, it may not be possible to sell enough advertising to cover the program\u2019s cost. In some instances, the Company may have to replace or cancel programs before fully amortizing their costs and, as a result, may have impairments that increase operating costs.\nIn addition, FCC rules affect the network-affiliate relationship. Among other things, these rules require network affiliation agreements to: (i) prohibit networks from requiring affiliates to clear time previously scheduled for other use, (ii) permit an affiliate to preempt network programs it believes are unsuitable for its audience and (iii) permit affiliates to substitute programs believed to be of greater local or national importance than network programming. In 2008, the FCC resolved a petition to review certain of these rules by clarifying its limitations on the extent to which the networks can exert control over the operations of their affiliates.\nIn recent years, the national broadcast networks have streamed their programming on the Internet and other distribution platforms in close proximity to network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those that the Company owns. These and other practices by the networks dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming originally broadcast by the local stations and could adversely affect the business, financial conditions, and results of operations of the Company\u2019s stations.\nThe non-renewal or termination of a network affiliation agreement or a change in network affiliations could have a material, adverse effect on the Company. The Company periodically renegotiates its major network affiliation agreements. There can be no assurance as to whether the Company\u2019s affiliation agreements will be renewed or as to what effect, if any, these renewals may have on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIf any of the Company\u2019s stations cease to maintain affiliation agreements with networks for any reason, the Company would need to find alternative sources of programming, which may be less attractive and more expensive. A change in network affiliation in a given television market may have many short- and long-term consequences, depending upon the circumstances surrounding the change. Potential short-term consequences include: (a) increased marketing costs and increased internal operating costs, which can vary widely depending on the amount of marketing required to educate the audience regarding the change and to maintain the station\u2019s viewing audience; (b) short-term loss of market share or slower market growth due to advertiser uncertainty about the switch; (c) costs of building a new or larger news operation; (d) other increases in station programming costs, if necessary; and (e) the cost of equipment needed to conform the station\u2019s programming, equipment and logos to the new network affiliation. Long-term consequences are more difficult to assess, due to the cyclical nature of each of the major networks\u2019 share of the audiences that changes from year-to-year with programs coming to the end of their production cycle, audience acceptance of new programs in the future, and the fact that national network audience ratings do not necessarily indicate how a network\u2019s programming may fare in a particular market. The circumstances that may surround a network affiliation switch cause uncertainty as to the actual costs that will be incurred by the Company, and if these costs are significant, the switch could have a material, adverse impact on the income the Company derives from the affected station.\nIn addition, syndication agreements are licenses to broadcast programs that are produced by production companies. Such programming can form a significant component of a station\u2019s programming schedule. Syndication agreements are subject to cancellation, which may affect a station\u2019s programming schedule, and the Company cannot be certain that it will continue to be able to acquire rights to syndicated programs once its current contracts for these programs end.\nThe consummation and integration of acquisitions pose various risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company has pursued and intends to selectively continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, subject to market conditions, the Company\u2019s liquidity, and the availability of attractive acquisition candidates. The Company may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets or have the financial capacity to complete future acquisitions. Acquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage, debt service requirements, future performance-based purchase obligations and combining company cultures and facilities, and the Company may not be able to successfully integrate acquired entities, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results, particularly during the period immediately following any acquisition. The Company may not be able to generate cost savings or increase revenues as a result of any acquisition. In addition, future acquisitions may result in the Company\u2019s assumption of unexpected liabilities and may result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the operation of the Company\u2019s core business.\nCertain acquisitions, such as acquisitions of television stations, are subject to the approval of the FCC and, potentially, other regulatory authorities. The need for FCC and other regulatory approvals could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to consummate future transactions and potentially require us to divest some television stations.\nThe Company may not achieve all of the synergies and cost savings that it expects to obtain from its acquisitions.\nIn connection with the Young Merger, LIN Merger and other acquisitions, the Company has disclosed, and may from time to time disclose or announce, potential synergies and cost savings that may be obtained in the future as a result of the acquisitions, including measures of revenue and profitability that give effect to potential synergies. The Company\u2019s determination of potential synergies and cost savings (and such measures of revenue and profitability) was based upon various assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. The Company cannot guarantee that it will necessarily generate all of the anticipated synergies from acquisitions, and the actual amount of synergies and cost savings it successfully obtains could be significantly lower than the amounts expected. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to generate synergies will be subject to governmental actions and policies which are outside of its control. All disclosures regarding anticipated synergies and cost savings (and any related measures of revenue and profitability) are forward-looking statements which should be reviewed together with the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in this report.\nThe Company\u2019s pension and postretirement benefit plans are currently underfunded. A declining stock market and lower interest rates could affect the value of its retirement plan assets and increase the Company\u2019s postretirement obligations.\nThe Company has qualified defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all Legacy Media General employees hired before January 1, 2007 and the IBEW Local 45 employees of KRON-TV. The Company also acquired LIN Media\u2019s defined benefit plans in the LIN Merger. As of December 31, 2014, these qualified retirement plans were underfunded by approximately $184.2 million after considering 2014 contributions. The qualified retirement plans had $437.6 million in total net assets available to pay benefits to participants enrolled in the Plans as of December 31, 2014. The Company made contributions of $45 million in January of 2014 to the Legacy Media General plan to reduce the funding gap. In the second half of 2014, the Company offered terminated vested participants of the Legacy Media General Retirement Plan an opportunity to receive a lump-sum payout in settlement of their retirement plan liability. Approximately half of the roughly 1,800 participants elected to do so, resulting in $70.6 million in payouts from plan assets to settle approximately $94 million in liability.\nThe Company also has non-contributory unfunded supplemental executive retirement and ERISA excess plans, both of which were amended and restated effective January 1, 2008, and both of which supplement the coverage available to certain Legacy Media General executives. There is also an unfunded plan that provides certain health and life insurance benefits to retired Legacy Media General employees who were hired prior to 1992 and a retirement medical savings account established as of January 1, 2007. Although the Company has frozen participation and benefits under all plans discussed in this section in either 2005 or 2009, two significant elements in determining the Company\u2019s pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting obligations. Large declines in the stock market (such as those seen in 2008) and lower discount rates (such as those seen in 2014) increase the Company\u2019s expense and may necessitate higher cash contributions to the qualified retirement plans.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards of Legacy Media General, Young and LIN Television to offset future taxable income currently is subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Code. Future transactions involving the Company and/or its shareholders could further limit the Company\u2019s ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the \u201cInternal Revenue Code\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitation on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (which we refer to as \u201cNOL carryforwards\u201d) to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such shareholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). An ownership change can result from, among other things, an offering of stock, the purchase or sale of stock by certain shareholders, or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire stock.\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, as of December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $635 million of NOL carryforwards attributable to Old Media General, Legacy Media General, Young and LIN Television. The Company\u2019s ability to use the NOL carryforwards of Legacy Media General, Young and LIN Television to offset future taxable income currently is subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Code. Future transactions involving the Company and/or its shareholders could further limit the Company\u2019s ability to use NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nSection 382 limitations may impact the timing of when cash is used to pay the Company\u2019s taxes and could cause some portion of the Company\u2019s NOL carryforwards to expire unused, in each case, reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOL carryforwards. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nThe July 2013 restructuring of LIN TV into a limited liability company enabled LIN TV to significantly reduce its 2013 tax liability. No assurance can be given that the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) will not challenge the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the restructuring.\nIn July 2013, LIN TV restructured by converting its form of organization from a corporation into a limited liability company, enabling it to significantly reduce its 2013 tax liability by allowing it to offset a tax loss recognized as a result of the restructuring against tax gains recognized in 2013. The July 2013 restructuring was effected by a merger of LIN TV with and into LIN. Because LIN TV\u2019s sole asset at the time of its merger with and into LIN was its 100% equity interest in LIN Television, LIN TV Corp. computed its gain or loss from the merger based on the trading price of the LIN TV class A common stock on the date of the merger. LIN TV\u2019s tax basis in its shares of LIN Television exceeded the fair market value of such shares at the time of the merger.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of the July 2013 restructuring depended, in part, on LIN being treated as a partnership, and not as a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes may nonetheless be taxable as a corporation if it is a \u201cpublicly traded partnership,\u201d unless an exception applies. An entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership is a publicly traded partnership if (1) interests in the partnership are traded on an established securities market or (2) interests in the partnership are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. An exception to taxation of a publicly traded partnership as a corporation, referred to as the \u201cqualifying income exception,\u201d is satisfied if at least 90% of the partnership\u2019s gross income for every taxable year consists of \u201cqualifying income\u201d and the partnership is not required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940. LIN reported qualifying income sufficient to satisfy the qualifying income exception for all relevant periods.\nNo rulings were requested from the IRS with respect to the tax consequences of the July 2013 restructuring. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not assert, or that a court will not sustain, a position contrary to any of the intended tax consequences of the restructuring, including the amount of any tax loss recognized as a result of the restructuring.\nImpairment of the value of the Company\u2019s goodwill and other intangible assets is possible, depending on future operating results and the value of its stock.\nThe Company periodically evaluates its goodwill and other intangible assets (primarily broadcast licenses, network affiliations, digital media assets and advertiser relationships) to determine if their carrying values are recoverable. Factors which influence the evaluation include expected future operating results (including assumptions around revenue growth, compensation levels, capital expenditures and discount rates), the Company\u2019s stock price and the market for buying/selling media assets. If the carrying value is no longer deemed to be recoverable, a charge to earnings may be necessary. Although those charges are non-cash in nature and do not affect the Company\u2019s operations, they could affect future reported results of operations and reduce the Company\u2019s shareholders\u2019 equity.\nCybersecurity risks could affect the Company\u2019s operating effectiveness.\nThe Company uses computers in substantially all aspects of its business operations. Its revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes the Company to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence. The Company has systems and processes in place to protect against risks associated with cyber incidents, and it maintains insurance coverage to mitigate cyber-related risks; however, depending on the nature of an incident, these protections may not be fully sufficient.\nThe Company may be unable to sufficiently reduce operating costs to offset potential revenue declines.\nThe Company previously has taken measures to manage its operating costs by reducing headcount, freezing or limiting certain employee benefits and implementing other cost-control measures across the Company. If further reductions in employee compensation and benefits are necessary, the Company may not be able to attract and retain key employees. Furthermore, significant portions of the Company\u2019s expenses are fixed in nature and may not be reduced easily if revenue declines occur, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company operates in a very competitive business environment.\nThe television industry is highly competitive, and this competition can draw viewers and advertisers from the Company\u2019s stations. Cable providers, direct broadcast satellite companies and telecommunication companies are developing new technologies that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences, reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the division of the television industry into ever more specialized niche markets. Competitors who target programming to such sharply defined markets may gain an advantage in garnering television advertising revenues. In addition, technological advancements and the resulting increase in programming alternatives, such as pay-per-view, home video and entertainment systems, video-on-demand, mobile video and the Internet, have created new types of competition to television broadcast stations and will increase competition for household audiences and advertisers. Technologies that allow viewers to digitally record, store and play back television programming may decrease viewership of commercials as recorded by media measurement services and, as a result, may lower the Company\u2019s advertising revenues. In addition, since digital television technology allows broadcasting of multiple channels within the additional allocated spectrum, this technology could expose the Company to additional competition from programming alternatives. The Company cannot provide any assurances that it will remain competitive in light of these developing technologies.\nThe Company faces competition from:\n\u25cf\nother local free over-the-air broadcast television and radio stations;\n\u25cf\ntelecommunication companies;\n\u25cf\ncable and satellite system operators;\n\u25cf\nInternet search engines, Internet service providers and websites; and new technologies including mobile television; and\n\u25cf\nother sources of news, information and entertainment such as newspapers, movie theaters, live sporting events and home video products, including digital video disc players.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to adapt to changes in technology in a timely manner may affect its business prospects and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s television stations are located in highly competitive markets. Accordingly, the results of the Company\u2019s operations will be dependent upon the ability of each station to compete successfully in its market, and there can be no assurance that any of the Company\u2019s stations will be able to maintain or increase its current audience share or revenue share. To the extent that certain of the Company\u2019s competitors have or may, in the future, obtain greater resources, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully in its broadcasting markets may be impeded.\nFurthermore, Internet programming services such as Aereo and FilmOnX sought to offer Internet-based program services in an attempt to retransmit existing broadcast stations without negotiating for carriage with the broadcaster or payment of any copyright or carriage fee. Despite a victory for broadcasters against Aereo before the U.S. Supreme Court, which has for now shut down Aereo\u2019s service, Aereo and similar companies may continue to attempt to develop technologies that retransmit or otherwise distribute content in a way that bypasses copyright or carriage fees. Even if broadcasters continue to bring successful litigation against these companies, there is no guarantee that they will be prevented from circumventing copyright or carriage fees in the future or detracting from the Company\u2019s viewership and advertising revenues. The Company\u2019s ability to adapt to changes in technology in a timely manner may affect its business prospects and results of operations.\nThe Company may experience disruptions in its business due to natural disasters, terrorism or similar events.\nIf natural disasters, acts of terrorism, political turmoil, or hostilities occur, one or more of the Company\u2019s broadcast stations could experience a loss of technical facilities for an unknown period of time and would, in addition, lose advertising revenues during such time period. In addition, if natural disasters, acts of terrorism, political turmoil or hostilities occur, even if the Company does not experience a loss of technical facilities, the Company\u2019s broadcast operations may switch to continual news coverage, which would cause the loss of advertising revenues due to the suspension of advertiser-supported commercial programming.\nThe Company could be adversely affected by labor disputes and legislation and other union activity.\nThe cost of producing and distributing entertainment programming has increased substantially in recent years due to, among other things, the increasing demands of creative talent and industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. The Company\u2019s program suppliers engage the services of writers, directors, actors and on-air and other talent, trade employees and others, some of whom are subject to these collective bargaining agreements. Also, as of December 31, 2014, approximately 420 of our employees are represented by labor unions under collective localized bargaining agreements with 3 different unions: the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians.\nFailure to renew these agreements, higher costs in connection with these agreements or a significant labor dispute, including strikes or work stoppages, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by causing, among other things, delays in production that lead to declining viewership, a significant disruption of operations and reductions in the profit margins of the Company\u2019s programming and the amounts the Company can charge advertisers for time. The Company\u2019s stations also broadcast certain professional sporting events, including NBA basketball games, MLB baseball games, NFL football games and other sporting events, and the Company\u2019s viewership may be adversely affected by player strikes or lockouts, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s advertising revenues and results of operations. Any changes in the existing labor laws may increase these risks.\nThe Company has made significant investments in digital business.\nAs a result of the LIN merger, the Company has an increased investment in emerging digital businesses that will have a greater impact on future operating results. Due to the intense competition, limited operating history, and rapidly evolving nature of these digital businesses, the actual future operating results of the digital businesses could be volatile and negatively impact the year-to-year operating trends of the Company.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Media General Common Stock\nCertain institutional investors own a significant percentage of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. This may allow such investors, individually or as a group, to exercise influence over the Company.\nStandard General controls approximately 20.6%, and investors affiliated with the Hicks Muse Fund may be deemed to control approximately 8.9%, of the voting power of all of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. This percentage may be increased to the extent any stockholders convert their voting common stock to non-voting common stock in accordance with the terms of the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation. In addition, a representative of each of Standard General and the Hicks Muse Fund is a member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. As a result, such investors, individually or in the aggregate, may have influence over the management of the Company. In addition, such substantial share ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. Their interest of institutional investors may not be consistent with the interests of the Company\u2019s other shareholders.\nProvisions of the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and By-laws and applicable state corporation laws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult and could deprive stockholders of the opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for shares of the common stock owned by them.\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and By-laws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in the management of the Company without the consent of the Board of Directors, which could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult. These provisions include: (i) the ability of the Board of Directors to determine whether to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used, to the extent consistent with its legal duties, to issue a series of stock to persons friendly to management in order to attempt to block an acquisition action by a hostile acquirer or to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer, (ii) the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the Board of Directors or the president, which may delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action and (iii) advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply in order to nominate candidates to the Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect such acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company. Under the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (\u201cVSCA\u201d) and the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation, stockholders will be prohibited from taking action by written consent unless the consent is unanimous, which makes action by written consent difficult to obtain and forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting. These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the Company or changes in its management.\nFurther, the \u201caffiliated transaction\u201d provisions of Virginia law prohibit, subject to certain exceptions, any person who becomes the beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of a corporation's voting securities, without the prior consent of that corporation\u2019s board of directors, from engaging in specified transactions with such corporation for a period of three years following the date upon which the stockholder acquires the requisite number of securities. The types of transactions covered by the law include certain mergers, share exchanges, material dispositions of corporate assets not in the ordinary course of business, dissolutions, reclassifications and recapitalizations. The Company did not opt out of this law in its Articles of Incorporation.\nThe Articles of Incorporation contain provisions allowing the Company to restrict the ownership, conversion and proposed ownership of common stock for reasons related to compliance with the FCC's rules and regulations.\nUnder the Articles of Incorporation, the Company may restrict the ownership, conversion or proposed ownership of shares of common stock by any person if such ownership, conversion or proposed ownership, either alone or in combination with other actual or proposed ownership of shares of capital stock of any other person, would impose restrictions upon the Company or its subsidiaries under, or cause a violation of, the laws administered or enforced by the FCC, including the Communications Act, which are referred to as \u201cfederal communications laws.\u201d The Company may enforce such restrictions if it believes the ownership, conversion or proposed ownership by a stockholder of common stock:\n\u25cf\nwould be in violation of any federal communications laws;\n\u25cf\nwould (or could reasonably be expected to) materially limit or impair any existing or proposed business activity of the Company or its subsidiaries under the federal communications laws;\n\u25cf\nwould materially limit or impair under the federal communications laws the acquisition of an attributable interest in a full-power television station by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for which it has entered into a definitive agreement with a third party;\n\u25cf\nwould (or could reasonably be expected to) cause the Company or any of its subsidiaries to be subject to any rule, regulation, order or policy under the federal communications laws having or which reasonably could be expected to have a material effect on the Company or any of its subsidiaries to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries would not be subject but for such ownership, conversion or proposed ownership; or\n\u25cf\nwould require prior approval from the FCC and such approval has not be obtained.\nThe restrictions that the Company may enact include refusing to permit the transfer of shares, suspending rights of share ownership, requiring the conversion of voting common stock to non-voting common stock, and other remedies. These provisions may restrict the ability to acquire, own and/or vote shares of voting common stock.\nSales of common stock by former equityholders of Young may have an adverse effect on the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn connection with the merger with Young, equity holders of Young received approximately 60.2 million shares of Media General\u2019s common stock. Certain equityholders of Young who received shares of Media General common stock in the transaction have the right to require Media General to register those shares under a registration rights agreement, subject to certain limitations. The registration rights agreement required the filing of a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 covering such shares, which may be used by the former Young equityholders party to such agreement to facilitate the sale of their shares under certain circumstances. The Company filed a Form S-3 in January 2014. Former Young equityholders party to the registration rights agreement also have the right to demand registration of their shares for sale in underwritten offerings, subject to certain limitations, and the right to participate in registered underwritten offerings conducted by the Company. Sales by such equityholders of their shares of common stock, or the possibility of such sales, pursuant to an underwritten offering or otherwise, may have an adverse effect on the per share price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company does not intend to pay cash dividends on its common stock for at least so long as it is restricted from doing so under its debt instruments.\nThe Company's ability to pay dividends is currently limited by its bank credit agreements until its total leverage ratio is below 5.0. The Company does not expect to be below this leverage ratio until the fourth quarter of 2015. Therefore, unless it seeks an amendment from its lenders under the credit facility, the Company is unlikely to pay dividends in the immediate future. Similarly the bond indentures of the Senior Notes issued by its operating subsidiaries limit the magnitude of distributions from the operating subsidiaries to the Company which may limit the Company's ability to return capital to its shareholders. The Restricted Payment covenant currently allowed by the indentures is in excess of $100 million. However, the Company does not expect to pay a dividend on its common stock in the near-term.\nThe Company has the ability to issue preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation allow the Board of Directors to issue up to 50 million shares of preferred stock and set the terms of such preferred stock. The terms of such preferred stock may adversely affect the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe public price and trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock may be volatile.\nThe price and trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuation in the stock price or trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock include:\n\u25cf\ngeneral market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the television broadcast industry and the financial markets generally;\n\u25cf\nthe political, economic and social situation in the United States;\n\u25cf\nactual or expected variations in operating results;\n\u25cf\nvariation in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf\ninability to meet projections in revenue;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by the Company or the Company\u2019s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other business developments;\n\u25cf\nadoption of new accounting standards affecting the industry in which the Company operates;\n\u25cf\noperations of competitors and the performance of competitors\u2019 common stock;\n\u25cf\nlitigation or governmental action involving or affecting the Company or its subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\npurchases or sales of blocks of the Company\u2019s common stock; and\n\u25cf\noperating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable.\nThere can be no assurance that the price of the Company\u2019s common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, regardless of the Company\u2019s operating performance. Stock price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of the common stock is low. Furthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock declines significantly, which may cause the Company to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of the Company\u2019s management.", "PERMNO": 81119, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "MEG.2"}
