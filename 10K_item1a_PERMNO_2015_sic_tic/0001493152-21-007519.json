{"cik": "895665", "company": "SUPERCONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following section includes some of the material factors that may adversely affect our business and operations. This is not an exhaustive list, and additional factors could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. This discussion of risk factors includes many forward-looking statements. For cautions about relying on such forward looking statements, please refer to the section entitled \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Report immediately prior to Item 1.\nWe have included disclosures throughout this Report, including Risk Factors, that relate to our business as it was conducted prior to the planned Merger and asset disposition described above. Readers are cautioned that both historical and forward looking disclosures, as well as Risk Factors, regarding our business must be read in conjunction with the information regarding the planned Merger and asset dispositions, because some disclosures regarding historical operations may not be indicative of future or current operations and plans. In particular, but without limitation, the reference to our historical business operations regarding our HTS wire should not be viewed as a statement that such operations continue to this day. Please see \u201cOur Future Business\u201d for additional important information.\nOverall Risk Related to Our Common Stock\nThe Clearday Merger is very uncertain. If it fails to occur in the near future, we likely will need to file for bankruptcy protection.\nAlthough we continue to negotiate the merger agreement with Clearday, there remain issues to be resolved, and given the limited time we have to conclude the negotiation, and the lack of any binding obligation on Clearday\u2019s part to consummate a transaction, there is a real possibility we will not be successful. In that event, our only likely option is a bankruptcy filing, in which case the payment to common stock holders would likely be nil. We estimate the outside date for completing our negotiation to be within approximately 30 to 45 days of the filing of this annual report on 10-K, after which time the risk of a failed negotiation materially increases. There is accordingly extremely great risk in investing in our common stock at this time. Indeed, even if we are successful negotiating the merger with Clearday, there will be significant risks associated with our new business.\nEven if the Merger is completed, there is no certainty regarding the performance of the combined company. Clearday is a private company with limited financial data. Any financial data of Clearday will only be available to stockholders upon the filing of the registration statement on Form S-4. Completion of the Merger would highly dilute the shares of existing STI stockholders, who, together with STI warrant holders, are collectively expected to own less than 4% of the combined company.\nAdditionally, the price of our securities may fluctuate significantly due to the market\u2019s reaction to the Merger and general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for our securities may never develop following the Merger or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of our securities following the Merger may vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses and may never become profitable.\nIn each of our last five years, we have experienced significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. In 2020, we incurred a net loss of $3 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $3.1 million. In 2019, we incurred a net loss of $9.2 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $8.8 million. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included in its audit reports an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Unless we can successfully implement our strategic alternatives plan including, among others, a strategic investment financing which would allow us to pursue our current business plan, a business combination such as our merger with Clearday, or a sale of STI, we will need to raise additional capital during this fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 to maintain our viability.\nWe may need to raise additional capital or complete a strategic alternative for the company. If we are unable to raise capital, our ability to implement our strategic plan and ultimately our viability as a company could be adversely affected.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $1.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our current forecast is that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the third quarter of 2021. Our cash resources will not be sufficient to fund our business through the end of the current fiscal year. Therefore we will need to raise additional capital during this fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 to maintain the viability of the Company.\nWe consummated various asset sales that fundamentally change our risk profile and business opportunities.\nIn order to enter into a possible Merger with Clearday, we effected certain transactions, including a cost reduction plan that was announced January 28, 2020 and sold, in separate transactions, assets that are not related to the Sapphire Cryocooler product and its related technologies. Accordingly, the risks of and opportunities for us have changed significantly since December 2019. If the proposed Merger is not consummated, we will likely need to seek liquidate or bankruptcy protection. If we were to liquidate or file for bankruptcy protection, the cash distribution to shareholders would be very limited in amount, if any.\nWe have a $1,600,000 preferred interest in Clearday\u2019s San Antonio headquarters building and such amount does not increase based on interest or other factors. Clearday has advised us that Clearday does not have any plans to sell or market such building, nor are we attempting to sell or market our interest in the building. Accordingly, we cannot rely on funds from our interest in the Clearday San Antonio headquarters to generate cash in the near term, nor can we be certain of the value of such interest if we were to seek to market it.\nOur stockholders may not realize a benefit from the merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Merger.\nIf the combined company is unable to realize the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger, our stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interest without receiving any commensurate benefit. The significant businesses of the combined company will be the Clearday businesses. Significant financial resources, management attention and other resources will be required for Clearday to continue to develop and expand its longevity care and wellness businesses. There can be no assurance that such development and expansion will be successful.\nBecause the lack of a public market for Clearday\u2019s capital stock makes it difficult to evaluate the fairness of the Merger, Clearday stockholders may receive consideration in the Merger that is greater than or less than the fair market value of Clearday\u2019s capital stock and/or we may issue more securities than the relative fair market value of Clearday\u2019s capital stock thereby diluting the existing stockholders of Superconductor more than the relative fair market values of Superconductor and Clearday prior to the merger.\nThe outstanding capital stock of Clearday is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair market value of Clearday\u2019s capital stock. Because the percentage of our equity to be issued to Clearday\u2019s shareholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of our securities to be received by Clearday holders will be less than the fair market value of their Clearday capital stock or that we may pay more than fair market value for Clearday\u2019s capital stock.\nOur stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the Merger, if an agreement is signed, and will exercise significantly less influence over the policies of the combined company following the merger than they now have on our policies.\nOur stockholders presently have the right to vote in the election of the Board of Directors and on other matters affecting us. Upon the completion of the Merger, if a new merger agreement is signed, our stockholders will own a significantly smaller percentage of the Superconductor common stock, on a fully diluted basis. As a result, current Superconductor stockholders will have significantly less influence on the management and policies of combined company after the Merger, if a new merger agreement is signed, is consummated than they have now.\nIf a new merger agreement is signed, our current stockholders will not have the right, even if voting as a single group, to elect any of the directors of Superconductor after the merger and our current Board of Directors before the Merger will not be on the Superconductor Board of Directors after the Merger with the exception of Jeffrey Quiram, and there is no obligation of any stockholder to reelect such director or for the governance and nominating committee of the combined company to nominate such individual for re-election after the merger.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 7,863 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $255.90 per share and warrants to purchase up to 623,921 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $44.80 per share. While these options and/or warrants are, as of the date of this filing, \u201cout of the money,\u201d if the price of our common stock (adjusted for any stock splits) were to exceed the exercise price of these options or warrants, then it becomes more likely that the holders of such securities will exercise them. In that case, current stockholders of our common stock would, as a group, receive substantially less than the equity stake described above to the extent that the currently \u201cout of the money\u201d options or warrants were to be exercised. We cannot predict if our stock price will rise or if the options or warrants will ever become \u201cin the money\u201d.\nWe and Clearday could seek to raise capital before the merger, which could be dilutive.\nIf a new merger agreement is signed, prior to the merger, Superconductor and Clearday will consider whether to issue new shares of common stock to raise equity capital for the combined company. No commitments to raise capital have been entered into or are currently contemplated.\nOur executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that may differ from stockholders\u2019 interests.\nIf a new merger agreement is signed, our stockholders should be aware that directors and executive officers of Superconductor have certain interests in such Merger that may differ from the interests of our stockholders. If a new merger agreement is signed, interests of the directors and executive officers of Superconductor are expected to include, but are not limited to, the treatment in such a Merger of Superconductor equity incentive awards and the benefits of certain specified executives under the officer agreements that provide for settlement of certain change in control or severance payments that Superconductor\u2019s executive officers are, by reason of their respective employment or severance agreements with Superconductor, entitled to receive in cash upon a qualifying termination of employment following the completion of the merger or, in the case of Mr. Quiram, with respect to the closing of a Merger, regardless of any termination. As a result of these interests, the directors and executive officers of Superconductor might be more likely to support and to vote in favor of a Merger than if they did not have these interests.\nWe and Clearday may become involved in securities litigation or stockholder derivative litigation in connection with the Merger, and this could divert the attention of Superconductor and Clearday management and harm the combined company\u2019s business, and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all related costs and damages.\nSecurities litigation or stockholder derivative litigation may follow the announcement of certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a business division or announcement of a business combination transaction. Superconductor and Clearday may become involved in this type of litigation in connection with a Merger, and the combined company may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the business of Superconductor, Clearday and the combined company. Our financial position is such that we may not be able to fully defend and exercise our rights to defend ourselves in any such litigation which may cause us to accept a settlement that would not be acceptable.\nOur ability to protect our patents and other proprietary rights is uncertain, exposing us to possible losses of competitive advantage.\nOur efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not succeed in preventing infringement by others or ensure that these rights will provide us with a competitive advantage. Pending patent applications may not result in issued patents and the validity of issued patents may be subject to challenge. Third parties may also be able to design around the patented aspects of the products. Additionally, certain of the issued patents and patent applications are owned jointly with third parties. Because any owner or co-owner of a patent can license its rights under jointly-owned patents or applications, inventions made by us jointly with others are not subject to our exclusive control. Any of these possible events could result in losses of competitive advantage.\nWe depend on specific patents and licenses to technologies, and we will likely need additional technologies in the future that we may not be able to obtain.\nWe utilize technologies under licenses of patents from others for our products. These patents may be subject to challenge, which may result in significant litigation expense (which may or may not be recoverable against future royalty obligations). Additionally, we may be required to utilize intellectual property rights owned by others and may seek licenses to do so. Such licenses may not be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. It is also possible that we may inadvertently utilize intellectual property rights held by others, which could result in substantial claims.\nIntellectual property infringement claims against us could materially harm results of operations.\nOur products incorporate a number of technologies, including high-temperature superconductor technology, technology related to other materials, and electronics technologies. Our patent positions, and that of other companies using high-temperature superconductor technology, is uncertain and there is significant risk that others, including our competitors or potential competitors, have obtained or will obtain patents relating to our products or technologies or products or technologies planned to be introduced by us.\nWe believe that patents may be or have been issued, or applications may be pending, claiming various compositions of matter used in our products. We may need to secure one or more licenses of these patents. There can be no assurances that such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may be required to expend significant resources to develop alternatives that would not infringe such patents or to obtain licenses to the related technology. We may not be able to successfully design around these patents or obtain licenses to them and may have to defend ourselves at substantial cost against allegations of infringement of third party patents or other rights to intellectual property. In those circumstances, we could face significant liabilities and also be forced to cease the use of key technology.\nOther parties may have the right to utilize technology important to our business.\nWe utilize certain intellectual property rights under non-exclusive licenses or have granted to others the right to utilize certain intellectual property rights licensed from a third party. Because we may not have the exclusive rights to utilize such intellectual property, other parties may be able to compete with us, which may harm our business.\nThe recent unprecedented events related to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused significant market disruptions and may have longer-term effects that we and, should the Merger be completed, the combined company cannot predict.\nThe recent unprecedented events related to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused significant market disruptions and may have longer-term effects that the combined company cannot predict. The equity and other market professionals continue to assess the consequences of the global pandemic and the extent and effectiveness of government responses, the responses of the Federal Reserve Bank and other governmental and non-governmental organizations cannot be predicted. Should the Merger be completed, the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to impact the business of the combined company, particularly with regard to the senior-care business of Clearday.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is expected to be, subject to significant volatility. The value of our common stock may decline regardless of our operating performance or prospects. Factors affecting our market price include:\n\u25cf market perception as to a possible Merger and the information provided about Clearday when and if it becomes available, including the risks related to the Clearday business, and the impact on us should the Merger not occur, including bankruptcy;\n\u25cf our perceived prospects and liquidity with and without the consummation of a Merger;\n\u25cf the impact of Superconductor\u2019s decision to sell certain assets that are not related to its Sapphire Cryocooler assets as part of its cost reduction plan and plan to sell assets including relating to its Conductus wire initiative;\n\u25cf variations in our operating results and whether we have achieved key business targets;\n\u25cf changes in, or our failure to meet, earnings estimates;\n\u25cf changes in securities analysts\u2019 buy/sell recommendations;\n\u25cf differences between our reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts;\n\u25cf announcements of new contracts by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf market reaction to any acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors; and\n\u25cf general economic, political or stock market conditions.\nRecent events have caused stock prices for many companies, including ours, to fluctuate in ways unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance. The general economic, political and stock market conditions that may affect the market price of our common stock are beyond our control. The market price of our common stock at any particular time may not remain the market price in the future.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants and options, and future sales of the shares obtained upon exercise of these options or warrants could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 7,863 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $255.90 per share and warrants to purchase up to 623,921 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $44.80 per share. The holders may sell these shares in the public markets from time to time under a registration statement or under Rule 144, without limitations on the timing, amount or method of sale. As our stock price rises, the holders may exercise their warrants and options and sell a large number of shares. This could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur corporate governance structure may prevent our acquisition by another company at a premium over the public trading price of our shares.\nIt is possible that the acquisition of a majority of our outstanding voting stock by another company could result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the public trading price for our shares. Provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, each as amended, and of Delaware corporate law could delay or make more difficult an acquisition of our company by merger, tender offer or proxy contest, even if it would create an immediate benefit to our stockholders. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation does not permit stockholders to act by written consent, and our bylaws generally require ninety days advance notice of any matters to be brought before the stockholders at an annual or special meeting.\nIn addition, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms, rights and preferences of this preferred stock, including voting rights of those shares, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. At December 31, 2020, 1,370,710 shares of preferred stock remained unissued. The rights of the holders of common stock may be subordinate to, and adversely affected by, the rights of holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock, even at a premium over our public trading price.\nFurthermore, our certificate of incorporation also provides for a classified board of directors with directors divided into three classes serving staggered terms. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us without action by our stockholders and, therefore, could adversely affect the price of our stock or the possibility of sale of shares to an acquiring person.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Should the Merger be completed, the combined company does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 79006, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "SCON"}
