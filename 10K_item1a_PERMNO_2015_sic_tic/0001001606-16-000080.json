RISK FACTORS\nRisks and Uncertainties Associated with the Proposed Merger-There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed Merger.\nOn December 9, 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement, which provides for the acquisition of Blount by affiliates of American Securities and P2 Capital Partners. The transaction is structured as a one-step merger with Blount as the surviving corporation. A number of risks and uncertainties are associated with the proposed Merger. For example, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the proposed Merger will be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived, including receipt of certain required regulatory approvals, the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Blount stockholders, the absence of any legal prohibitions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties under the Merger Agreement, compliance by the parties with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement and the absence of a Company material adverse effect. Parent is also not required to consummate the proposed Merger until after the completion of a marketing period described in the Merger Agreement for the debt financing it is using to fund a portion of the merger consideration.\nOther events may also occur, which could delay or result in the failure to consummate the proposed Merger, including litigation relating to the proposed Merger or the failure of Parent to obtain the necessary debt financing provided for by the commitment letters received in connection with the proposed Merger. If the proposed Merger is not consummated for any reason, Blount stockholders will not receive the consideration that Parent has agreed to pay upon the consummation of the proposed Merger, and the price of Blount common stock may decrease to the extent that its current market price reflects an assumption that the proposed Merger will be consummated. Such price decrease may be significant.\nAdditionally, we are currently subject to certain \"no shop\" provisions in the Merger Agreement that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to discuss, facilitate or commit to third-party acquisition proposals to acquire all or a significant part of the Company. In addition, we will be required to pay a termination fee of approximately $14.7 million to Parent if (a) the Merger Agreement is terminated so that we can enter into an agreement with respect to a \u201csuperior proposal\u201d (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (b) the Merger Agreement is terminated by Parent due to a change of recommendation with respect to the Merger Agreement by the Board or the Special Committee or (c) each of the following three events occurs:\n\u2022\nprior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, the Merger Agreement is terminated by us or Parent because the Merger has not been consummated by the termination date (June 4, 2016) or because our stockholders have not adopted the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nany person has made (and has not subsequently withdrawn prior to the event giving rise to such termination) a proposal to acquire more than 75% of our common stock or assets after the date of the Merger Agreement but prior to such termination; and\n\u2022\nwithin 12 months after such termination, we enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such acquisition proposal, or a transaction contemplated by such acquisition proposal is otherwise consummated within 12 months of such termination.\nThese provisions might discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing an acquisition, even if the party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the cash value to be received in the proposed Merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee.\nFurthermore, pending the closing of the proposed Merger, the Merger Agreement also restricts us from engaging in certain actions without Parent's consent, which could prevent us from pursuing opportunities that may arise prior to the closing of the proposed Merger and may be beneficial to our future performance.\nIf the proposed Merger is completed, we will no longer exist as a public company and Blount stockholders will forego any increase in our value that might have otherwise resulted from our possible future growth.\nBusiness Impact of the Proposed Merger-Our business could be adversely impacted as a result of uncertainty related to the proposed Merger or by the failure to consummate the proposed Merger.\nThe proposed Merger could cause disruptions to our business or our business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. For example, our employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which may adversely affect our ability to hire and retain key personnel. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties. In addition, our management team and other employees are devoting significant time and effort to activities related to the proposed Merger.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable regardless of whether or not the proposed Merger is consummated. In the event the proposed Merger is not consummated for any reason, or the timing of its consummation is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of the incurrence of these significant additional expenses and the diversion of management attention.\nIn addition, if the proposed Merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers, suppliers, and employees. We also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the proposed Merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to attempt to force us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nInterests of Certain Executive Officers and Directors-Certain of our executive officers and directors have interests in the proposed Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Blount stockholders generally.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors have interests in the proposed Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Blount stockholders generally. The interests of our directors and executive officers in the proposed Merger are described in detail in the definitive proxy statement regarding the proposed Merger, which we filed with the SEC on March 9, 2016.\nCompetition-Competition may result in decreased sales, operating income, and cash flows.\nThe markets in which we operate are competitive. We believe that design features, product quality, product performance, customer service, delivery lead times, and price are the principal factors considered by our customers. Some of our competitors may have, or may develop, greater financial resources, lower costs, superior technology, more favorable operating conditions, or may require lower returns on capital invested than we do. For example, our competitors have expanded capacity and contracted with suppliers located in China and other low-cost manufacturing locations as a means to lower costs. Although we have also established a manufacturing facility in China, international competition from emerging economies has nevertheless been formidable and has, in some cases, negatively affected our business through the introduction of lower competitive pricing in our markets. We may not be able to compete successfully with our existing or any new competitors, and the competitive pressures we face may result in decreased sales, operating income, and cash flows. Competitors could also obtain knowledge of our proprietary manufacturing techniques and processes and reduce our competitive advantage by copying such techniques and processes. Certain of our customers also compete with us with certain products in selected markets, and they may expand their production and marketing of competing products in the future.\nKey Customers-Loss of one or more key customers would substantially decrease our sales.\nIn 2015, none of our customers individually accounted for 10% or more of our total sales and our top five customers accounted for 19.1%, of our total sales. While we expect these business relationships to continue, the loss of any of these key customers, or a substantial portion of their business, would most likely significantly decrease our sales, operating income, and cash flows. Certain customers may also decide to self-manufacture various components that we currently sell to them, which would have an adverse effect on our business. For example, one of our customers, the Husqvarna Group, has announced its plan to manufacture certain cutting chain, which we have historically supplied to them, and we expect this change will result in a reduction in our sales, operating income, and cash flows.\nKey Suppliers and Raw Materials Costs-The loss of a few key suppliers or increases in raw materials costs could substantially decrease our sales or increase our costs.\nWe purchase raw materials, components, and parts from a limited number of suppliers that meet our quality criteria. We generally do not operate under long-term written supply contracts with our suppliers. Although alternative sources of supply are available, the sudden elimination or disruption of certain suppliers could result in manufacturing delays, an increase in costs, a reduction in product quality, and a possible loss of sales in the short-term. In 2015, we purchased $13.0 million in products from our largest supplier and $46.3 million in products and raw materials from our top five suppliers.\nSome raw materials, in particular cold-rolled strip steel, are subject to price volatility over periods of time. In 2015 we purchased $79.2 million of steel. In addition to steel raw material, we also purchase components and sub-assemblies that are made with steel, and prices for these items are subject to steel price volatility risk. We have entered into purchase contracts with certain suppliers to stabilize near-term pricing on a portion of our steel purchases, but we have not entered into any derivative instruments to hedge against the price volatility of any raw materials. It has been our experience that raw material price increases are sometimes difficult to recover from our customers in the short-term through increased pricing. We estimate that a 10% change in the price of steel purchased as raw material, without a corresponding increase in selling prices, would have increased 2015 loss before income taxes by $7.9 million.\nForeign Sales and Operations-We have substantial foreign sales, operations, and property, which could be adversely affected as a result of changes in local economic or political conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, unexpected changes in regulatory environments, or potentially adverse tax consequences.\nIn 2015, approximately 51% of our sales were shipped to customers outside of the U.S. International sales and operations are subject to inherent risks, including changes in local economic or political conditions, instability of government institutions, the imposition of currency exchange restrictions, unexpected changes in legal and regulatory environments, nationalization of private property, and potentially adverse tax consequences. Under some circumstances, these factors could result in significant declines in international sales or loss of assets.\nSome of our sales and expenses are denominated in local currencies that are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. Dollar. Historically, our principal local currency exposures have been related to manufacturing costs and expenses in Brazil, Canada, and China, and local currency sales and expenses in Europe, South America, Canada, and China. From time to time, we manage some of our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations through derivative products. However, such derivative products merely reduce the short-term volatility of currency fluctuations, and do not eliminate their effects over the long-term. We estimate the year-over-year movement of foreign currency exchange rates from 2014 to 2015, whereby the U.S. Dollar strengthened in relation to most foreign currencies, decreased our sales by $42.0 million and increased our operating income by $0.6 million from the translation of foreign currency denominated transactions into U.S. Dollars. Any change in the exchange rates of currencies in jurisdictions into which we sell products or incur significant expenses could result in a significant decrease in reported sales and operating income. For example, we estimate that a 10% stronger Canadian Dollar in relation to the U.S. Dollar would have increased our operating loss by $5.0 million in 2015. We estimate that a 10% weaker Euro in relation to the U.S. Dollar would have reduced our sales by $9.5 million and increased our operating loss by $1.2 million in 2015.\nAlso, approximately 55% of our foreign sales in 2015 were denominated in U.S. Dollars. We may see a decline in sales during periods of a strengthening U.S. Dollar, which can make our prices less competitive in international markets. We attribute much of the 2015 decline in sales unit volume to the impact on competitive pricing from the stronger U.S. Dollar. Furthermore, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, it becomes more costly for foreign customers to pay their U.S. Dollar receivable balances owed to us. They may have difficulty in repaying these amounts, and in turn, our bad debt expense may increase.\nIn addition, we own substantial manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2015, 48%, or 857,555 of the total square feet of our owned facilities are located outside of the U.S., and 26% of our leased square footage is located outside the U.S. This foreign-based property, plant, and equipment (\"PP&E\") is subject to inherent risks for the reasons cited above. Loss of these facilities or restrictions on our ability to use them would have an adverse effect on our manufacturing and distribution capabilities and would result in reduced sales, operating income, and cash flows.\nSanctions by the U.S. government against certain companies and individuals in Russia and Ukraine may hinder our ability to conduct business with potential or existing customers and vendors in these countries.\nWe currently derive a portion (approximately 1.8% in 2015) of our revenue from Russia and Ukraine, and have a sales and distribution office in Russia. Recently, the U.S. government imposed sanctions through several executive orders restricting U.S. companies from conducting business with specified Russian and Ukrainian individuals and companies. While we believe that the executive orders currently do not preclude us from conducting business with our current customers in Russia and Ukraine, the sanctions imposed by the U.S. government may be expanded in the future and restrict our activities with them. If we are unable to conduct business with new or existing customers or pursue opportunities in Russia or Ukraine, our sales, operating income, and cash flows, could be adversely affected.\nWeather-Sales of many of our products are affected by weather patterns and the occurrence of natural disasters.\nSales of many of our products are influenced by weather patterns that are clearly outside our control. For example, drought conditions tend to reduce the demand for agricultural and yard care products, such as tractor attachments and lawnmower blades, and conversely, plentiful rain conditions stimulate demand for these products. Extreme cold weather can affect the agricultural cycle and adversely affect our business. For example, during 2015, harsh winter conditions in North America delayed the spring planting season and adversely affected our FRAG agricultural attachment sales. Conversely, cold winter weather can stimulate demand for our forestry and log splitter products. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, typhoons, and ice and wind storms that knock down trees can stimulate demand for our forestry and log splitter products. Conversely, a relative lack of severe weather and natural disasters can result in reduced demand for these same products.\nFinancial Leverage and Debt-Due to our financial leverage, we could have difficulty operating our business and satisfying our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have $582.7 million of total liabilities, including $379.0 million of debt. Our debt leverage is significant, and may have important consequences for us, including the following:\n\u2022\nA significant portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of interest expense and required principal repayments, which reduces the funds that would otherwise be available to fund operations and future business opportunities. Cash interest and mandatory debt principal payments totaled $29.2 million during 2015.\n\u2022\nA substantial decrease in net operating income and cash flows or a substantial increase in expenses may make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements or force us to modify our operations.\n\u2022\nOur financial leverage may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures.\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain additional or replacement financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or other purposes, may be impaired, or such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us under current market conditions for credit. Our current senior credit facilities mature on May 5, 2020.\nWe have available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior credit facilities of $43.9 million as of December 31, 2015. If we or any of our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness, the risks outlined above could worsen. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and product development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our ability to generate cash, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control.\nOur historical financial results have been, and we anticipate that our future financial results will continue to be, subject to fluctuations in customer orders, sales, operating results, and cash flows. Our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. An inability to pay our debts would require us to pursue one or more alternative capital raising strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, or selling equity capital. However, alternative strategies may not be feasible at the time or may not prove adequate, which could cause us to default on our obligations and would impair our liquidity. Also, some alternative strategies would require the prior consent of our secured lenders, which we may not be able to obtain. See also Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRestrictive Covenants-The terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our senior credit facilities.\nA breach of any of our restrictive debt covenants could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt. An acceleration of our repayment obligations under our senior credit facilities could result in a payment or distribution of substantially all of our assets to our secured lenders, which would materially impair our ability to operate our business as a going concern. In addition, our senior credit facility agreement, among other things, restricts and/or limits our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nincur debt;\n\u2022\nguarantee indebtedness of others;\n\u2022\npay dividends on our stock;\n\u2022\nrepurchase our stock;\n\u2022\npursue business acquisitions;\n\u2022\nmake certain types of investments;\n\u2022\nuse assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into certain new businesses; and\n\u2022\nmake certain payments in respect of subordinated indebtedness.\nIn addition, the senior credit facilities require us to maintain certain financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests, which may require that we take actions to reduce debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests could be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet those ratios and tests. A breach of any of these covenants could, if uncured, constitute an event of default under the senior credit facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior credit facilities, together with any accrued interest and commitment fees, to be immediately due and payable. If we and certain of our subsidiaries were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior credit facilities could enforce the guarantees from the guarantors and proceed against the collateral securing the senior credit facilities. The assets of Blount, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary and issuer of the debt under our senior credit facilities, and the applicable guarantors could be insufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness. See also Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAssets Pledged as Security on Credit Facilities-The majority of our assets and the capital stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary Blount, Inc. are pledged to secure obligations under our senior credit facilities.\nThe Company and all of its domestic subsidiaries other than Blount, Inc. guarantee Blount, Inc.\u2019s obligations under the senior credit facilities. The obligations under the senior credit facilities are collateralized by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Blount, Inc. and its domestic subsidiaries, as well as a pledge of all of Blount, Inc.\u2019s capital stock held by Blount International, Inc. and all of the stock of domestic subsidiaries held by Blount, Inc. Blount, Inc. has also pledged 65% of the stock of its direct non-domestic subsidiaries as additional collateral. An event of default under our senior credit facilities could trigger our lenders\u2019 contractual rights to enforce their security interests in these assets.\nLitigation-We may have litigation liabilities that could result in significant costs to us and, in the case of stockholder litigation relating to the proposed Merger, could delay or prevent the proposed Merger.\nOur historical and current business operations have experienced a number of litigation matters, including litigation involving personal injury or death, as a result of alleged design or manufacturing defects of our products, and litigation involving alleged patent infringement. Certain of these liabilities relate to our discontinued operations and were retained by us under terms of the relevant divestiture agreements. Some of the product liability claims made against us seek significant or unspecified damages for serious personal injuries for which there are retentions or deductible amounts under our insurance policies. In the future, we may face additional lawsuits, and it is difficult to predict the amount and type of litigation that we may face. Litigation, insurance, and other related costs could result in future liabilities that are significant and that could significantly reduce our operating income, cash flows, and cash balances.\nAdditionally, we and the members of our Board (including Joshua L. Collins, the chairman of our Board and our chief executive officer, and David A Willmott, our president and chief operating officer, both in their capacities as officers and members of our Board) have been named as defendants in litigation relating to the Merger Agreement and the proposed Merger. American Securities, P2 Capital Partners and certain of their respective affiliates, and Goldman, Sachs & Co., financial advisor to our Board in connection with the proposed Merger (\u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d), have also been named as defendants. The litigation plaintiff has alleged that (1) the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties of care and loyalty in connection with their negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement, (2) the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duty of disclosure by filing a preliminary proxy statement that fails to disclose and/or misrepresents material information and (3) P2 Capital Partners, one of P2 Capital Partners\u2019 affiliates and Goldman Sachs aided and abetted such alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The plaintiff has asked the court to, among other things, (i) preliminarily and permanently enjoin the defendants from proceeding with the proposed Merger on the current terms, and (ii) in the event that the proposed Merger is consummated, rescind the proposed Merger or grant rescissory damages. Further lawsuits may be filed in connection with the proposed Merger. The closing of the proposed Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the condition that no order, judgment, injunction, award, decree or writ of any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has been issued and continues in effect that prohibits, restrains, enjoins or renders illegal the consummation of the proposed Merger. If any lawsuits are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from completing the proposed Merger on the agreed-upon terms, such injunction may prevent the completion of the proposed Merger in the expected time frame or altogether.\nSee also Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnvironmental Matters-We face potential exposure to environmental liabilities and costs.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Violations of, or liabilities incurred under, these laws and regulations could result in an assessment of significant costs to us, including civil or criminal penalties, claims by third parties for personal injury or property damage, requirements to investigate and remediate contamination, and the imposition of natural resource damages. Furthermore, under certain environmental laws, current and former owners and operators of contaminated property or parties who sent waste to a contaminated site can be held liable for cleanup, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the disposal activity at the time it was performed. This potential exposure to environmental liabilities and costs can apply to both our current and former operating facilities, including those related to our discontinued operations.\nFuture events, such as the discovery of additional contamination or other information concerning releases of hazardous substances at our or other sites affected by our actions, changes in existing environmental laws or their interpretation, including changes related to climate change, and more rigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities may require additional expenditures by us to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, investigate and monitor contamination at sites, clean contaminated sites, or curtail our operations. These expenditures could significantly reduce our net income and cash flows. See also Item 1, Business-Environmental Matters, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGeneral Economic Factors-We are subject to general economic factors that are largely out of our control, any of which could, among other things, result in a decrease in sales, net income, and cash flows, and an increase in our interest or other expenses.\nOur business is subject to a number of general economic factors, many of which are largely out of our control, which may, among other effects, result in a decrease in sales, net income, and cash flows, and an increase in our interest or other expenses. These factors include recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers\u2019 business cycles, as well as downturns in the principal regional economies where our operations are located. Economic conditions may adversely affect our customers\u2019 business levels and the amount of products that they need. Furthermore, customers encountering adverse economic conditions may have difficulty in paying for our products and actual bad debts may exceed our allowance for bad debts. World-wide economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers and they may not be able to provide us with the goods and services we need on a timely basis, which could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products. Our senior credit facility borrowings are at variable interest rates. Increases in market reference interest rates could increase our interest expense payable under the senior credit facilities to levels in excess of what we currently expect. We estimate that an increase in our average interest rates in 2015 of 100 basis points would have increased our interest expense by $4.6 million. In addition, fluctuations in the market values of equity and debt securities held in the Company\u2019s pension plan assets can adversely affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans. The expense and funding requirements for these plans may increase in the future as a result of reduced values of the plan assets. Changes in reference interest rates can also have a significant effect on the measurement of post-employment benefit plan obligations and the related expense recognized. Furthermore, terrorist\nactivities, anti-terrorist efforts, war, or other armed conflicts involving the U.S. or its interests abroad may result in a downturn in the U.S. and global economies and exacerbate the risks to our business described in this paragraph.\nKey Employees-The loss of key employees could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiency.\nMany of our manufacturing processes require a high level of expertise. For example, we build our own complex dies for use in cutting and shaping steel into components for our products. The design and manufacture of such dies are highly dependent on the expertise of key employees. We have also developed numerous proprietary manufacturing techniques that rely on the expertise of key employees. Our manufacturing efficiency and cost could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain these key employees or continue to train them or their replacements. Uncertainties associated with the proposed Merger may cause a loss of management or other key employees.\nCommon Stock Price-The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and stockholders could lose all or part of their investment.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent stockholders from being able to sell their shares at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons that include:\n\u2022\nfailure to complete the proposed Merger, or a significant delay in completing the proposed Merger;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industries;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to events and results contained in our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stock of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in general conditions in the U.S. and global economies, financial markets, or the industries we market our products to, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, changes in technology or competition, or responses to such events;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by our largest stockholders, directors, or executive officers; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn addition, the stock market and our common stock have historically experienced price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industries. The changes in prices frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies. For example, over the preceding two-year period, our highest closing stock price has exceeded our lowest closing stock price by 250.0%. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.\nCommon Stock Sales-Future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price.\nOwnership and control of our common stock is concentrated in a relatively small number of institutional investors. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 48% of our outstanding common stock was owned or controlled by our five largest stockholders. If the proposed Merger does not close as anticipated, we may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings. Additionally, other stockholders with significant holdings of our common stock may sell large amounts of shares they own in a secondary or open market stock offering. We may also issue additional shares of common stock to finance future transactions. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or shares sold by existing stockholders), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nDisruptions in Shipping-A prolonged disruption in transportation logistics could affect our ability to import critical components and to ship our products to customers.\nWe rely on third party vendors for a substantial portion of our shipping needs, including both obtaining raw materials and products from suppliers and delivering our products to customers, and a significant amount of our shipping is via ocean transport. A significant disruption in transportation logistics could disrupt our ability to obtain raw materials and products from suppliers, and in turn disrupt our ability to manufacture our products and sell them to our customers. Significant disruption of shipping could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows, and could increase our transportation costs.\nComputer Transaction Processing-An information technology system failure or breach of security may adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems to manage our operations and transact our business. An information technology system failure due to computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, power interruptions, hardware failures, fire, natural disasters, human error, or other causes could disrupt our operations and prevent us from being able to process transactions with our customers, operate our manufacturing facilities, and properly report those transactions in a timely manner. A significant, protracted information technology system failure may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn recent years we have increased the volume of sales transactions processed over the Internet. As a result, sensitive information about our customers is stored in electronic media. If unauthorized access to this information were gained, we could be subject to penalties or claims by our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nMaterial Weaknesses-Management\u2019s determination that material weaknesses exists in our internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse impact on our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we report annually on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We must conduct an assessment of our internal controls to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our management concluded that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting existed and that internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2014. As a result of these material weaknesses, management also determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not fully effective as of December 31, 2014.\nIn connection with our compliance efforts during the three years ended December 31, 2015, we have incurred substantial accounting, information technology, internal audit, external audit, and other expenses, as well as significant management time and resources, to remediate these material weaknesses. As of December 31, 2015, our material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting have been remediated. Our future assessment, or the future assessment by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal new material weaknesses in our internal controls. Whether new material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting are discovered or not, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses in our compliance efforts.", "PERMNO": 65154, "SIC": 3420, "TIC": "BLT"}
