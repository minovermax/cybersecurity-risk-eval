Risk Factors\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including, in particular, certain statements about our plans, strategies and prospects. Although we believe that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that such plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements include those set forth in this Risk Factors section. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or any persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth below. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d include Industrial Services of America, Inc. and subsidiaries.\nIf any of the following risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe operate in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nDemand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. The timing and magnitude of the cycles in the industries in which our products are used, including global metal production, are difficult to predict. The cyclical nature of our operations tends to reflect and be amplified by changes in economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, and foreign currency exchange fluctuations. The impact of recent political events, such as tariffs on metal imports, on global economic conditions is currently uncertain. Economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth in the industries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business has a major involvement in ferrous and non-ferrous metals. This market is extremely competitive and increased competition could result in a reduction of our revenue and consequent decrease in our common stock price.\nThe metal recycling business is highly competitive. Pricing and proximity to a metal source are the major competitive factors in the metal recycling business. Many companies offer or are engaged in the development of products or the provisions of services that may be or are competitive with our current products or services. Certain of our competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and other resources and assets than we possess. In addition, the industry is constantly changing as a result of consolidation, which may create additional competitive pressures in our business environment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current market share or obtain our desired market share based on the competitive nature of this industry.\nChanges in the availability or price of raw materials and end-of-life vehicles could reduce our sales.\nWe rely on suppliers for most of our raw material needs. Industry supply conditions generally involve risks, including the possibility of shortages of raw materials, increases in raw material costs and reduced control over delivery schedules. We procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources. These suppliers generally are not bound by long-term contracts and have no obligation to sell scrap metal to us. In periods of declining or lower scrap metal prices, such as the declining price environment we experienced in fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016, suppliers may elect to hold scrap metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities, tightening supply. If a substantial number of suppliers cease selling scrap metal to us, we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. A slowdown of industrial production in the U.S. may also reduce the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metals recycling industry, resulting in less recyclable metal available to process and market. Increased competition for domestic scrap metal, including as a result of overcapacity in the scrap recycling industry in the U.S. and Canada, may also reduce the supply of scrap metal available to us. Failure to obtain a steady supply of scrap material could both adversely impact our ability to meet sales commitments and reduce our operating margins. Failure to obtain an adequate supply of end-of-life vehicles could adversely impact our ability to attract customers and reduce our parts sales.\nSignificant decreases in scrap metal prices may adversely impact our operating results.\nThe timing and magnitude of the cycles in the industries in which we operate are difficult to predict and are influenced by different economic conditions. Purchase prices for scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles and selling prices for recycled scrap metal are subject to market forces beyond our control. While we attempt to respond to changing recycled scrap metal selling prices through adjustments to our metal purchase prices, our ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our metal purchase prices to fully offset a sharp reduction in recycled scrap metal sales prices, which may adversely impact our operating income and cash flows. In fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016, lower demand for recycled scrap metal relative to demand and competition for supply of unprocessed scrap metal in the domestic market compressed operating margins due to selling prices decreasing at a faster rate than purchase prices for unprocessed scrap metal. In addition, a rapid decrease in selling prices may compress our operating margins due to the impact of average inventory cost accounting, which causes cost of goods sold recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to decrease at a slower rate than metal purchase prices and net selling prices.\nVolatility in market prices of our scrap metal recycling inventory may cause us to re-assess the carrying value of our inventory and adversely affect our balance sheet.\nWe make certain assumptions regarding future demand and net realizable value in order to assess that we record our ferrous and non-ferrous inventory properly at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We base our assumptions on historical experience, current market conditions and current replacement costs. If the anticipated future selling prices of scrap metal and finished steel products should decline due to the cyclicality of the business or otherwise, we would re-assess the recorded net realizable value of such inventory which could result in downward adjustments to reduce the value of such inventory (and increase cost of sales) to the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nPotential limitations on our ability to access capital resources may restrict our ability to operate.\nOur operations are capital intensive. Our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. While we expect that our cash requirements, including the funding of capital expenditures and debt service, will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our line of credit, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Additional capital expenditures could require financing from external sources. Although we believe we have adequate access to contractually committed borrowings, we could be adversely affected if our lender was unable to honor the contractual commitments or ceased lending. Failure to access our line of credit could restrict our ability to fund operations or make capital expenditures.\nThe agreement governing our line of credit facility imposes certain restrictions on our business and contains financial covenants.\nOur line of credit facility contains certain restrictions on our business which limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things, dispose of collateral, incur certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, sales or asset acquisitions, make distributions and other restricted payments, materially change the nature of our business, and engage in transactions with affiliates. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business or execute our strategy and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nOur line of credit agreement also requires that we maintain certain financial and other covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or financial covenants could result in an event of default under the lender credit agreement, and permit our lender to cease lending to us and declare all amounts borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. This could require us to refinance our line of credit, which we may not be able to do at terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur debt may increase our vulnerability to economic or business downturns.\nWe are vulnerable to higher interest rates because interest expense on our borrowing is based on margins over a variable base rate. We may experience material increases in our interest expense as a result of increases in general interest rate levels. Our current line of credit agreement with our lender contains a subjective acceleration clause and requires the Company to maintain a lockbox arrangement with the lender. Upon a breach of covenants in our lending facility, our lender could exercise its remedies related to any material breaches, including acceleration of our payments and taking action with respect to its loan security. We have relied upon and will rely on borrowings under various credit facilities to operate our business. We may not have the ability to borrow from other lenders to operate our business.\nAn increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are dependent upon fuel, which we generally purchase in the open market on a daily basis. Direct fuel costs include the cost of fuel and other petroleum-based products used to operate our fleet of cranes and heavy equipment, as well as our shredder when it is not idled. We are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel costs which include fuel surcharges from vendors. When we have experienced increases in the cost of fuel and other petroleum-based products in the past, we were able to pass a portion of these increases on to our customers. However, because of the competitive nature of the industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on current or future increases in fuel prices to our customers. A significant increase in fuel costs could adversely affect our business, which adverse impact would be magnified if combined with a decrease in revenue caused by a decrease in commodity prices.\nWe could incur substantial costs in order to comply with, or to address any violations under, environmental laws that could significantly increase our operating expenses and reduce our operating income.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state and federal environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other matters:\n\u2022\nWaste disposal;\n\u2022\nAir emissions;\n\u2022\nWaste water and storm water management and treatment;\n\u2022\nSoil and groundwater contamination remediation; and\n\u2022\nEmployee health and safety.\nFailure to maintain or achieve compliance with these laws and regulations or with the permits required for our operations could result in substantial operating costs and capital expenditures, in addition to fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party claims for property damage or personal injury, cleanup costs or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations. Certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes. Material environmental liabilities could exist, including cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations where we disposed of materials from our operations, which could result in future expenditures that we cannot currently estimate and which could reduce any profits.\nOur financial statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.\nWe have prepared our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions we made. Actual results could differ from these amounts. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of long-lived assets, valuation allowances for accounts receivable, inventory, lower of cost or net realizable value, stock option values, liabilities for potential litigation, claims and assessments, and liabilities for environmental remediation and deferred taxes.\nWe depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could prevent us from implementing our business strategy.\nOur success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team. The loss of any members of our management team or the failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy and continuing to grow our business at a rate necessary to achieve and maintain future profitability.\nSeasonal changes may adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather, which could decrease the collection and shipment volume of recyclable materials.\nA disruption in our information technology systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nCyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. We rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our information technology systems. Despite the security measures that we have implemented, including those measures related to cybersecurity, our systems could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, natural or man-made incidents or disasters or unauthorized physical or electronic access. A breach could result in business disruption, theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer and supplier information and unauthorized access to personnel information. To the extent that our business is interrupted or data is lost, destroyed or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could materially and adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers and suppliers, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nFuture sales of our common stock could depress our market price and diminish the value of your investment.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. If our existing shareholders sell a large number of shares, or if we issue a large number of shares, the market price of our common stock could significantly decline. Moreover, the perception in the public market that our existing shareholders and, in particular, Kletter affiliates might sell shares of common stock could depress the market for our common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nIn recent periods, there has been volatility in the market price for our common stock. In addition, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future in response to a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nOur quarterly operating results or the operating results of our operations in the ferrous, non-ferrous and used auto parts industries;\n\u2022\nChanges in general conditions in the economy, the financial markets or the ferrous and non-ferrous recycling industry;\n\u2022\nLoss of significant customers; and\n\u2022\nIncreases in materials and other costs.\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results.", "PERMNO": 83875, "SIC": 4953, "TIC": "IDSA"}
