RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below with all of the other information included in this report in evaluating an investment in our common stock. If any of the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur ability to implement our business strategy may be materially and adversely affected by many known and unknown factors.\nOur business strategy relies upon our future ability to successfully market natural gas to end-users, develop and maintain cost-effective logistics in our supply chain and construct, develop and operate energy-related infrastructure in North America. Our business strategy assumes that we will be able to expand our operations further in North America, enter into long-term purchase and supply contracts with end-users, acquire and transport LNG at attractive prices, develop infrastructure, and other future projects, into efficient and profitable operations in a timely and cost-effective way, obtain approvals from all relevant federal, international, state and local authorities, as needed, for the construction and operation of these projects and other relevant approvals, and obtain long-term capital appreciation and liquidity with respect to such investments. Our strategy may also be affected by future governmental laws and regulations. It also assumes that we will be able to enter into strategic relationships with energy end-users, power utilities, LNG providers, shipping companies, infrastructure developers, financing counterparties and other partners. These assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive, regulatory and operational uncertainties, contingencies and risks, many of which are beyond our control. Additionally, in furtherance of our business strategy, we may acquire operating businesses or other assets in the future. Any such acquisitions would be subject to significant risks and contingencies, including the risk of integration, and we may not be able to realize the benefits of any such acquisitions.\nOur future ability to execute our business strategy is uncertain, and it can be expected that one or more of our assumptions will prove to be incorrect and that we will face unanticipated events and circumstances that may adversely affect our business. Any one or more of the following factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our proposed strategy and achieve our targets:\n\u2022\nfailure to develop cost-effective logistics solutions;\n\u2022\nfailure to manage expanding operations in the projected time frame;\n\u2022\ninability to structure innovative and profitable energy-related transactions and to optimally price and manage position, performance and counterparty risks;\n\u2022\ninability to develop infrastructure and other future projects in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\ninability to attract and retain personnel in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nfailure of investments in technology and machinery, such as liquefaction technology or LNG tank truck technology, to perform as expected;\n\u2022\nincreases in competition which could increase costs and undermine profits;\n\u2022\ninability to source LNG in sufficient quantities and/or at economically attractive prices;\n\u2022\nfailure to anticipate and adapt to new trends in the energy sector in North America and elsewhere;\n\u2022\nincreases in operating costs, including the need for capital improvements, insurance premiums, general taxes, real estate taxes and utilities, affecting our profit margins;\n\u2022\ninability to raise significant additional debt and equity capital in the future to implement our business strategy as well as to operate and expand our business;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, political and business conditions in North America and in the other geographic areas we now operate and intend to operate in the future;\n\u2022\ninflation, depreciation of the currencies of the countries in which we operate and fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u2022\nfailure to win new bids or contracts;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain approvals from governmental regulators and relevant local authorities for the construction and operation of potential future projects and other relevant approvals;\n\u2022\nexisting and future governmental laws and regulations; or\n\u2022\ninability, or failure, of any customer or contract counterparty to perform their contractual obligations to us (for further discussion of counterparty risk, see \u201c-Risks Related to Our Business-Our current ability to generate cash is substantially dependent upon the performance by customers under short-term contracts that we have entered into or will enter into in the near future, and we could be materially and adversely affected if any customer fails to perform its contractual obligations for any reason, including nonpayment and nonperformance, or if we fail to enter into such contracts at all\u201d).\nIf we experience any of these failures, such failure may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to execute our business strategy.\nInvestment in us is speculative.\nOur strategy may not be successful, and if unsuccessful, we may be unable to modify it in a timely and successful manner. We cannot give you any assurance that we will be able to implement our strategy on a timely basis, if at all, or achieve our internal model or that our assumptions will be accurate. Accordingly, your investment in our company is speculative and subject to a high degree of risk, and you should understand that there is a possibility of the loss of your entire investment. Our limited history also means that we continue to develop and implement various policies and procedures including those related to data privacy and other matters.\nWe will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures while we develop infrastructure for our supply chain and other future projects. We will need to invest significant amounts of additional capital to implement our strategy. We could experience delays beyond the expected development period which could increase the level of operating losses and negative operating cash flows. Our future liquidity may also be affected by the timing of construction financing availability in relation to the incurrence of construction costs and other outflows and by the timing of receipt of cash flows under our customer contracts in relation to the incurrence of project and operating expenses. Our ability to generate any positive operating cash flow and achieve profitability in the future is dependent on, among other things, our ability to develop an efficient supply chain and successfully and timely complete necessary infrastructures and fulfill our gas delivery obligations under our customer contracts.\nOur business is dependent upon obtaining substantial additional funding from various sources, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms.\nOur net working capital may not be sufficient to fully execute our business plan in the future. Assuming the accuracy of our assumptions relating to our business strategy, we believe that our cash resources will only be sufficient to meet projected capital expenditures, financing obligations and operating requirements in the near term. In the future, we expect to pursue additional offerings of debt or equity securities to assist us in developing our operations. If we are unable to secure additional funding, or if it is only available on terms that we determine are not acceptable, we may be unable to fully execute our business plan, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that such additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nA variety of factors beyond our control could impact the availability or cost of capital, including domestic or international economic conditions, increases in key benchmark interest rates and/or credit spreads, the adoption of new or amended banking or capital market laws or regulations, the re-pricing of market risks and volatility in capital and financial markets, risks relating to the credit risk of our customers and the jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as general risks applicable to the energy sector. Our financing costs could increase or future borrowings or equity offerings may be unavailable to us or unsuccessful, which could cause us to be unable to pay or refinance our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may rely on borrowings under debt instruments to fund our capital expenditures. If any of the lenders under these potential debt instruments were unable to perform on its commitments, we may need to seek replacement financing, which may not be available as needed, or may be available in more limited amounts or on more expensive or otherwise unfavorable terms.\nAfter our recent acquisitions, we may not be profitable for an indeterminate period of time.\nWe have a limited operating history and therefore have not achieved consistent profitability on an annual basis. We will need to make significant additional investments to develop, improve and operate our business. We also expect to make significant expenditures and investments in identifying, acquiring and/or developing other future projects. We also expect to incur significant expenses in connection with the launch and continued growth of our business, including costs for LNG purchases, truck transportation, shipping and logistics, personnel and technological improvements. We may need to raise significant additional debt and equity capital to achieve our goals.\nWe may not be able to achieve profitability, and if we do, we cannot assure you that we would be able to sustain such profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or sustain profitability would have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our common stock.\nBecause we are currently dependent upon a limited number of customers, the loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our operating results.\nA limited number of customers currently represent a substantial majority of our income. Our operating results are currently contingent on our ability to maintain LNG services to these customers. At least in the short term, we expect that a substantial majority of our sales will continue to arise from a concentrated number of customers, such as power utilities, energy producers and industrial end-users. We may be unable to accomplish our business plan to diversify and expand our customer base by attracting a broad array of customers, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur current ability to generate cash is substantially dependent upon the performance by customers under short-term contracts that we have entered into or will enter into in the near future, and we could be materially and adversely affected if any customer fails to perform its contractual obligations for any reason, including nonpayment and nonperformance, or if we fail to enter into such contracts at all.\nOur current results of operations and liquidity are, and will continue to be in the near future, substantially dependent upon performance by a small number of customers, which have each entered into supply agreements and other similar contracts of variable durations. Our near term ability to generate cash is dependent on the small number of customers\u2019 continued willingness and ability to perform their obligations under their respective contracts. If any of these customers fails to perform its obligations under their contracts, our operating results, cash flow and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected, even if we were ultimately successful in seeking damages from any of these customers for a breach of the contract.\nRisks of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers are a consideration in our businesses, and our credit procedures and policies may be inadequate to sufficiently eliminate customer credit risk. As part of our business strategy, we intend to target customers who have not been traditional purchasers of natural gas, including customers in developing countries, and these customers may have greater credit risk than typical natural gas purchasers. Therefore, we may request pre-payments in advance for purchasing LNG or our services for certain customers that pose a greater customer credit risk than other companies in the industry. Further, adverse economic conditions in the energy industry increase the risk of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers, particularly customers that have sub-investment grade credit ratings or significant counterparty risks.\nOur customer contracts are subject to termination under certain circumstances.\nOur customer contracts contain various termination rights. For example, each of the long-term customer contracts we maintain contains various termination rights including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nfor no cause by giving notice as agreed in the contract;\n\u2022\nupon the occurrence of certain events of force majeure;\n\u2022\nif we fail to make available specified scheduled cargo quantities;\n\u2022\nupon the occurrence of certain uncured payment defaults;\n\u2022\nupon the occurrence of an insolvency event;\n\u2022\nupon the occurrence of certain uncured, material breaches; and\n\u2022\nif we fail to commence commercial operations within the agreed timeframes.\nWe may not be able to replace these contracts on desirable terms, or at all, if they are terminated. Contracts that we enter into in the future may contain similar provisions. If any of these current or future contracts are terminated, such termination could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and prospects.\nCyclical or other changes in the demand for and price of LNG and natural gas may adversely affect our business and the performance of our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and prospects.\nOur business and the development of energy-related infrastructure and projects generally is based on assumptions about the future availability and price of natural gas and LNG markets. Natural gas and LNG prices have at various times been and may become volatile due to one or more of the following factors:\n\u2022\nadditions to competitive regasification capacity in North America and other markets, which could divert LNG or natural gas from our business;\n\u2022\ninsufficient or oversupply of natural gas liquefaction or export capacity worldwide;\n\u2022\ninsufficient LNG tanker capacity;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nreduced demand and lower prices for natural gas;\n\u2022\nincreased natural gas production deliverable by pipelines, which could suppress demand for LNG;\n\u2022\ndecreased oil and natural gas exploration activities, which may decrease the production of natural gas, or decrease the demand for LNG used in the oil and gas exploration and production process;\n\u2022\ncost improvements that allow competitors to offer LNG regasification services at reduced prices;\n\u2022\nchanges in supplies of, and prices for, alternative energy sources such as coal, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar energy, which may reduce the demand for natural gas;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory, tax or other governmental policies regarding imported or exported LNG, natural gas or alternative energy sources, which may reduce the demand for imported or exported LNG and/or natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in natural gas producing regions;\n\u2022\nimposition of tariffs by China or any other jurisdiction on imports of LNG from the United States; and\n\u2022\ncyclical trends in general business and economic conditions that cause changes in the demand for natural gas.\nAdverse trends or developments affecting any of these factors could result in decreases in the prices at which we are able to sell LNG and natural gas and related services or increases in the prices we have to pay for natural gas or LNG, which could materially and adversely affect the performance of our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and prospects.\nFailure to maintain sufficient working capital could limit our growth and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant working capital requirements, primarily driven by the delay between the purchase of and payment for natural gas and the payment terms that we offer our customers. Differences between the date when we pay our LNG supply and service providers and the date when we receive payments from our customers may adversely affect our liquidity and our cash flows. We expect our working capital needs to increase as our total business increases. If we do not have sufficient working capital, we may not be able to pursue our growth strategy, respond to competitive pressures or fund key strategic initiatives, such as the development of our facilities, which may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperation of our LNG infrastructure and other facilities that we may construct involves significant risks.\nAs more fully discussed in this report, our existing facilities and expected future facilities face operational risks, including the following: performing below expected levels of efficiency, breakdowns or failures of equipment, operational errors by trucks, operational errors by us or any contracted facility operator, labor disputes and weather-related or natural disaster interruptions of operations.\nAny of these risks could disrupt our operations and increase our costs, which would adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe operation of our plants will involve particular, significant risks.\nThe operation of our plants will involve particular, significant risks, including, among others: failure to maintain the required license(s) or other permits required to operate our plants; pollution or environmental contamination affecting operation of our plants; the inability, or failure, of any counterparty to any plant-related agreements to perform their contractual obligations to us and planned and unplanned power outages due to maintenance, expansion and refurbishment. We cannot assure you that future occurrences of any of the events listed above or any other events of a similar or dissimilar nature would not significantly decrease or eliminate the revenues from, or significantly increase the costs of operating, our plants. As a consequence, there may be reduced or no revenues from our plants which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nGlobal climate change may in the future increase the frequency and severity of weather events and the losses resulting therefrom, which could have a material adverse effect on the economies in the markets in we operate or plan to operate in the future and therefore on our business.\nOver the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, such as global warming, have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of the world, including the markets in which we operate and intend to operate, and have created additional uncertainty as to future trends. There is a growing consensus today that climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and, in recent years, the frequency of major weather events appears to have increased. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by natural events, such as severe tropical storms and hurricanes, will affect our operations or the economies in our current or future market areas, but the increased frequency and severity of such weather events could increase the negative impacts to economic conditions in these regions and result in a decline in the value or the destruction of our liquefiers and downstream facilities or affect our ability to transmit LNG. In particular, if one of the regions in which we operate is impacted by such a natural catastrophe in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, the economies of such impacted areas may require significant time to recover and there is no assurance\nthat a full recovery will occur. Even the threat of a severe weather event could impact our business, financial condition or the price of our common stock.\nHurricanes or other natural or manmade disasters could result in an interruption of our operations, a delay in the completion of our liquefaction facilities, higher construction costs or the deferral of the dates on which payments are due under our customer contracts, all of which could adversely affect us.\nStorms and related storm activity and collateral effects, or other disasters such as explosions, fires, seismic events, floods or accidents, could result in damage to, or interruption of operations in our supply chain, including at our facilities or related infrastructure, as well as delays or cost increases in the construction and the development of our proposed facilities or other infrastructure. Due to the concentration of our current plant operations in coastal areas of North America, we are particularly exposed to the risks posed by hurricanes, tropical storms and their collateral effects. For example, the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season caused extensive and costly damage across the U.S. Gulf Coast, Eastern Seaboard, and the Caribbean. We are unable to predict with certainty the impact of future storms on our customers, infrastructure or operations.\nIf one or more trailer, terminals, pipelines, facilities, equipment or electronic systems that we own, lease or operate or that deliver products to us or that supply our facilities and our customers\u2019 facilities are damaged by severe weather or any other disaster, accident, catastrophe, terrorist or cyber-attack or event, our operations and construction projects could be delayed and our operations could be significantly interrupted. These delays and interruptions could involve significant damage to people, property or the environment, and repairs could take a week or less for a minor incident to six months or more for a major interruption. Any event that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations, or that causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe intend to maintain insurance against certain risks and losses. We may not be able to maintain desired or required insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nThe rapid spread of a contagious illness such as a novel coronavirus, or fear of such an event, may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus. As the outbreak is still evolving, much of its impact remains unknown. However, our reliance on third-party suppliers, contractors, service providers, and commodity markets exposes us to possibility of delay or interruption of our operations. In addition, if our customers are impacted, we may experience a lower demand for LNG or natural gas. It is impossible to predict the effect of the continued spread, or fear of continued spread, of the coronavirus globally. Should the coronavirus continue to spread globally or not be contained to countries with current outbreaks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, operational delays and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations. We depend on digital technology to manage our operations and other business processes and to record financial, operating and other sensitive data. Our business partners, including vendors, customers and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. Our technologies, systems networks, and those of our business partners, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the disruption of our business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities. A cyber incident could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel, or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance may be insufficient to cover losses that may occur to our property or result from our operations.\nOur current operations and future projects are subject to the inherent risks associated with LNG, natural gas and power operations, including explosions, pollution, release of toxic substances, fires, seismic events, hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions, and other hazards, each of which could result in significant delays in commencement or interruptions of operations and/or result in damage to or destruction of our facilities and assets or damage to persons and property. In addition, such operations and the modes of transport of third parties on which our current operations and future projects may be dependent face possible risks associated with acts of aggression or terrorism. Some of the regions in which we operate are affected by hurricanes or tropical storms. We do not, nor do we intend to, maintain insurance against all of these risks and losses. In particular, we do not carry business interruption insurance for hurricanes and other natural disasters. Therefore, the occurrence of one or more significant events not fully insured or\nindemnified against could create significant liabilities and losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe may be unable to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future. For example, environmental regulations have led in the past to increased costs for, and in the future may result in the lack of availability of, insurance against risks of environmental damage or pollution. A catastrophic release of natural gas, marine disaster or natural disasters could result in losses that exceed our insurance coverage, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Any uninsured or underinsured loss could harm our business and financial condition. In addition, our insurance may be voidable by the insurers as a result of certain of our actions.\nChanges in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks or political change may also make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain. In addition, the insurance that may be available may be significantly more expensive than our existing coverage.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes.\nIn the future we may be subject to material legal proceedings in the course of our business, including, but not limited to, actions relating to contract disputes, business practices, intellectual property and other commercial and tax matters. Such legal proceedings may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or might necessitate changes to our business or operations, and the defense of such actions may be both time consuming and expensive. Further, if any such proceedings were to result in an unfavorable outcome, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe construction of our energy-related infrastructure is subject to operational, regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which may result in delays, increased costs or decreased cash flows.\nThe construction of energy-related infrastructure, including liquefaction facilities, as well as other future projects, involves numerous operational, regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks beyond our control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital during construction and thereafter. These potential risks include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to complete construction projects on schedule or at the budgeted cost due to the unavailability of required construction personnel or materials, accidents or weather conditions;\n\u2022\nwe will not receive any material increase in operating cash flows until a project is completed, even though we may have expended considerable funds during the construction phase, which may be prolonged;\n\u2022\nwe may construct facilities to capture anticipated future energy consumption growth in a region in which such growth does not materialize;\n\u2022\nthe completion or success of our construction project may depend on the completion of a third-party construction project (e.g., additional public utility infrastructure projects) that we do not control and that may be subject to numerous additional potential risks, delays and complexities;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain key permits or land use approvals including those required under environmental laws on terms that are satisfactory for our operations and on a timeline that meets our commercial obligations, and there may be delays, perhaps substantial in length, such as in the event of challenges by citizens groups or non-governmental organizations, including those opposed to fossil fuel energy sources;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to local opposition, including the efforts by environmental groups; and\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain rights-of-way to construct additional energy-related infrastructure or the cost to do so may be uneconomical.\nA materialization of any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to achieve growth in the level of our cash flows or realize benefits from future projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect to be dependent on our primary building contractor and other contractors for the successful completion of our energy-related infrastructure.\nTimely and cost-effective completion of energy-related infrastructure, including liquefaction facilities, as well as future projects, in compliance with agreed specifications is central to our business strategy and is highly dependent on the performance of our primary building contractor and subcontractors. The ability of our primary building contractor and our other contractors to perform successfully under their agreements with us is dependent on a number of factors, including the contractor\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\ndesign and engineer each of our facilities to operate in accordance with specifications;\n\u2022\nengage and retain third-party subcontractors and procure equipment and supplies;\n\u2022\nrespond to difficulties such as equipment failure, delivery delays, schedule changes and failures to perform by subcontractors, some of which are beyond their control;\n\u2022\nattract, develop and retain skilled personnel, including engineers;\n\u2022\npost required construction bonds and comply with the terms thereof;\n\u2022\nmanage the construction process generally, including coordinating with other contractors and regulatory agencies; and\n\u2022\nmaintain their own financial condition, including adequate working capital.\nUntil we have entered into an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (\u201cEPC\u201d) contract for a particular project, in which the EPC contractor agrees to meet our planned schedule and projected total costs for a project, we are subject to potential fluctuations in construction costs and other related project costs. Although some agreements may provide for liquidated damages if the contractor fails to perform in the manner required with respect to certain of its obligations, the events that trigger a requirement to pay liquidated damages may delay or impair the operation of the applicable facility, and any liquidated damages that we receive may be delayed or insufficient to cover the damages that we suffer as a result of any such delay or impairment. The obligations of our primary building contractor and other contractors to pay liquidated damages under their agreements with us are subject to caps on liability, as set forth therein. Furthermore, we may have disagreements with our contractors about different elements of the construction process, which could lead to the assertion of rights and remedies under our contracts and increase the cost of the applicable facility or result in a contractor\u2019s unwillingness to perform further work. If any contractor is unable or unwilling to perform according to the negotiated terms and timetable of its respective agreement for any reason or terminates its agreement for any reason, we would be required to engage a substitute contractor, which could be particularly difficult in certain of the markets in which we operate or plan to operate. This would likely result in significant project delays and increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe are relying on third party engineers to estimate the future rated capacity and performance capabilities of our existing and future facilities, and these estimates may prove to be inaccurate.\nWe are relying on third parties for the design and engineering services underlying our estimates of the future rated capacity and performance capabilities of our liquefaction facilities, as well as other future projects. If any of these facilities, when actually constructed, fails to have the rated capacity and performance capabilities that we intend, our estimates may not be accurate. Failure of any of our existing or future facilities to achieve our intended future capacity and performance capabilities could prevent us from achieving the commercial start dates under our customer contracts and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe may not be able to purchase or receive physical delivery of natural gas in sufficient quantities and/or at economically attractive prices to satisfy our delivery obligations under our commercial agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient quantities of LNG or natural gas to satisfy delivery obligations, which may provide customers with the right to terminate our commercial agreements. In addition, price fluctuations in natural gas and LNG may make it expensive or uneconomical for us to acquire adequate supply of these items.\nWe will be dependent upon third party LNG suppliers and shippers and facilities to provide delivery options to and from their energy-related infrastructure. If LNG were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs or damage to supplier facilities, lack of capacity or any other reason, our ability to continue delivering natural gas to end-users could be restricted, thereby reducing revenues. Any permanent interruption at any key LNG supply chains that caused a material reduction in volumes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nRecently, the LNG industry has experienced increased volatility. If market disruptions and bankruptcies of third party LNG suppliers and shippers negatively impacts our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of LNG or significantly increases our costs for purchasing LNG, our business, operating results, cash flows and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. There can be no assurances that we will be able to supply our customers with LNG produced at our own facilities.\nWe face competition based upon market price for LNG or natural gas.\nOur business is subject to the risk of natural gas and LNG price competition at times when we need to replace any existing customer contract, whether due to natural expiration, default or otherwise, or enter into new customer contracts. Factors relating to\ncompetition may prevent us from entering into new or replacement customer contracts on economically comparable terms to existing customer contracts, or at all. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects. Factors which may negatively affect potential demand for natural gas from our business are diverse and include, among others:\n\u2022\nincreases in worldwide LNG production capacity and availability of LNG for market supply;\n\u2022\nincreases in demand for natural gas but at levels below those required to maintain current price equilibrium with respect to supply;\n\u2022\nincreases or decreases in the cost of LNG;\n\u2022\ndecreases in the cost of competing sources of natural gas, LNG or alternate fuels such as coal, heavy fuel oil and diesel; and\n\u2022\ndisplacement of LNG or fossil fuels more broadly by alternate fuels or energy sources or technologies (including but not limited to nuclear, wind, solar, biofuels and batteries) in locations where access to these energy sources is not currently available or prevalent.\nTechnological innovation may render our processes obsolete.\nThe success of our current operations and future projects will depend in part on our ability to create and maintain a competitive position in the natural gas liquefaction industry. In particular, although we plan to utilize proven technologies such as those currently in operation at our George West plant, we do not have any exclusive rights to any of these technologies. In addition, such technologies may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by legal or regulatory requirements, technological advances, more efficient and cost-effective processes or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors or others, which could materially and adversely affect our business, ability to realize benefits from future projects, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nChanges in legislation and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nOur business is subject to governmental laws, rules, regulations and requires permits that impose various restrictions and obligations that may have material effects on our results of operations. In addition, each of the applicable regulatory requirements and limitations is subject to change, either through new regulations enacted on the federal, state or local level, or by new or modified regulations that may be implemented under existing law. The nature and extent of any changes in these laws, rules, regulations and permits may be unpredictable and may have material effects on our business. Future legislation and regulations or changes in existing legislation and regulations, or interpretations thereof, such as those relating to the liquefaction, storage, or regasification of LNG, or its transportation could cause additional expenditures, restrictions and delays in connection with our operations as well as other future projects, the extent of which cannot be predicted and which may require us to limit substantially, delay or cease operations in some circumstances. Revised, reinterpreted or additional laws and regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating costs and restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business, our ability to expand our business, including into new markets, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nIncreasing trucking regulations may increase costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are using transportation systems that include trucks that we own and operate. Such operations are subject to various trucking safety regulations, including those which are enacted, reviewed and amended by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (\u201cFMCSA\u201d). These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, driver licensing, insurance requirements, financial reporting and review of certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, and transportation of hazardous materials. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state and/or local safety regulations that mirror federal regulations but also regulate the weight and size dimensions of loads.\nAll federally regulated carriers\u2019 safety ratings are measured through a program implemented by the FMCSA known as the Compliance Safety Accountability (\u201cCSA\u201d) program. The CSA program measures a carrier\u2019s safety performance based on violations observed during roadside inspections as opposed to compliance audits performed by the FMCSA. The quantity and severity of any violations are compared to a peer group of companies of comparable size and annual mileage. If a company rises above a threshold established by the FMCSA, it is subject to action from the FMCSA. There is a progressive intervention strategy that begins with a company providing the FMCSA with an acceptable plan of corrective action that the company will implement. If the issues are not corrected, the intervention escalates to on-site compliance audits and ultimately an \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d rating and the revocation of the company\u2019s operating authority by the FMCSA, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations and financial position.\nAny trucking operations would be subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may increase our costs. Some of these possible changes include changes in environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, onboard black box recorder device requirements or limits on vehicle weight and size.\nCompetition in the LNG industry is intense, and some of our competitors have greater financial, technological and other resources than we currently possess.\nWe plan to operate in the highly competitive area of LNG production and face intense competition from independent, technology-driven companies as well as from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies and utilities, many of which have been in operation longer than us.\nMany competing companies have secured access to, or are pursuing development or acquisition of, LNG facilities in North America. We may face competition from major energy companies and others in pursuing the proposed business strategy to provide LNG. Some of these competitors have longer operating histories, more development experience, greater name recognition, larger staffs and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we currently possess. We also face competition for the contractors needed to build our facilities. The superior resources that some of these competitors have available for deployment could allow them to compete successfully against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, ability to realize benefits from future projects, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nFailure of LNG to be a competitive source of energy in the markets in which we operate, and seek to operate, could adversely affect our expansion strategy.\nOur operations are, and will be, dependent upon LNG being a competitive source of energy in the markets in which we operate. In the United States, due mainly to a historic abundant supply of natural gas and discoveries of substantial quantities of unconventional, or shale, natural gas, imported LNG has not developed into a significant energy source. The success of the domestic liquefaction component of our business plan is dependent, in part, on the extent to which natural gas can, for significant periods and in significant volumes, be produced in the United States at a lower cost than the cost to produce some domestic supplies of other alternative energy sources, and that it can be transported at reasonable rates through appropriately-scaled infrastructure.\nAdditionally, natural gas competes with other sources of energy, including coal, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar energy, which may become available at a lower cost in certain markets. As a result of this and other factors, natural gas may not be a competitive source of energy in the markets we intend to serve or elsewhere. The failure of natural gas to be a competitive supply alternative to oil and other alternative energy sources could adversely affect our ability to deliver LNG or natural gas to our customers in North America or other locations on a commercial basis.\nOur risk management strategies cannot eliminate all LNG price and supply risks. In addition, any non-compliance with our risk management strategies could result in significant financial losses.\nWhen engaged in marketing activities, it is our strategy to maintain a manageable balance between LNG purchases, on the one hand, and sales or future delivery obligations, on the other hand. Through these transactions, we seek to earn a margin for the LNG purchased by selling LNG for physical delivery to third-party users, such as public utilities, industrial users, trucking fleets and other potential end-users converting from traditional diesel or oil fuel to natural gas. These strategies cannot, however, eliminate all price risks. For example, any event that disrupts our anticipated supply chain could expose us to risk of loss resulting from price changes if we are required to obtain alternative supplies to cover these transactions. We are also exposed to basis risks when LNG is purchased against one pricing index and sold against a different index. Moreover, we are also exposed to other risks, including price risks on LNG we own, which must be maintained in order to facilitate transportation of the LNG to our customers or to our facilities. In addition, our marketing operations involve the risk of non-compliance with our risk management policies. We cannot assure you that our processes and procedures will detect and prevent all violations of our risk management strategies, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved. If we were to incur a material loss related to commodity price risks, including non-compliance with our risk management strategies, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will be able to supply our customers with LNG produced at its own facilities.\nWe may experience increased labor costs, and the unavailability of skilled workers or failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect us.\nWe are dependent upon the available labor pool of skilled employees, including truck drivers. We compete with other energy companies and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to construct and operate energy-related infrastructure and to provide our customers with the highest quality service. In addition, the tightening of the transportation related labor market due to the shortage of skilled truck drivers may affect our ability to hire and retain skilled truck drivers and require us to pay increased wages. We, and our subsidiaries in the United States who hire personnel, are also subject\nto the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions. We are also subject to applicable labor regulations in the other jurisdictions in which we operate, including Canada and Mexico. We may face challenges and costs in hiring, retaining and managing our employee base. A shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations, could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and could require an increase in the wage and benefits packages that we offer, thereby increasing our operating costs. Any increase in our operating costs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets.\nWe test our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. We currently intend to test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently as circumstances dictate. Significant negative industry or economic trends, and decline of market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows for business segments or disruptions to business could lead to an impairment charge of the long-lived assets, including our goodwill. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. Projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from results. In addition, if our analysis results in an impairment to our goodwill or long-lived assets, we may be required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during a period in which such impairment is determined to exist, which may negatively impact our operating results.\nA major health and safety incident involving LNG or the energy industry more broadly or relating to our business may lead to more stringent regulation of LNG operations or the energy business generally, could result in greater difficulties in obtaining permits, including under environmental laws, on favorable terms, and may otherwise lead to significant liabilities and reputational damage.\nHealth and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance from our operations may result in an event that causes personal harm or injury to our employees, other persons, and/or the environment, as well as the imposition of injunctive relief and/or penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements or litigation. Any such failure that results in a significant health and safety incident may be costly in terms of potential liabilities, and may result in liabilities that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage. Such a failure, or a similar failure elsewhere in the energy industry (including, in particular, LNG liquefaction, storage, transportation or regasification operations), could generate public concern, which may lead to new laws and/or regulations that would impose more stringent requirements on our operations, have a corresponding impact on our ability to obtain permits and approvals, and otherwise jeopardize our reputation or the reputation of our industry as well as our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies and local communities. Individually or collectively, these developments could adversely impact our ability to expand our business, including into new markets. Similarly, such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nFailure to obtain and maintain permits, approvals and authorizations from governmental and regulatory agencies on favorable terms with respect to the design, construction and operation of our facilities could impede operations and construction and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe design, construction and operation of energy-related infrastructure, including existing and proposed facilities, the import and export of LNG and the transportation of natural gas, are highly regulated activities at the federal, state and local levels. Approvals of the Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (\u201cNGA\u201d), as well as several other material governmental and regulatory permits, approvals and authorizations, including under the Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d) and the Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d) and their state analogues, may be required in order to construct and operate an LNG facility and export LNG. Permits, approvals and authorizations obtained from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d), DOE and other federal and state regulatory agencies also contain ongoing conditions, and additional requirements may be imposed. Certain federal permitting processes may trigger the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d), which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. Compliance with NEPA may extend the time and/or increase the costs for obtaining necessary governmental approvals associated with our operations and create independent risk of legal challenges to the adequacy of the NEPA analysis, which could result in delays that may adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and profitability. We may also be subject to yet additional requirements in Canada and Mexico or other jurisdictions, including with respect to land use approvals needed to construct and operate our facilities.\nWe cannot control the outcome of any review and approval process, including whether or when any such permits, approvals and authorizations will be obtained, the terms of their issuance, or possible appeals or other potential interventions by third parties that could interfere with our ability to obtain and maintain such permits, approvals and authorizations or the terms thereof. If we are unable to obtain and maintain such permits, approvals and authorizations on favorable terms, we may not be able to recover our investment in our projects. Many of these permits, approvals and authorizations require public notice and comment before they can\nbe issued, which can lead to delays to respond to such comments, and even potentially to revise the permit application. There is no assurance that we will obtain and maintain these governmental permits, approvals and authorizations on favorable terms, or that we will be able to obtain them on a timely basis, and failure to obtain and maintain any of these permits, approvals or authorizations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects. Moreover, many of these permits, approvals and authorizations are subject to administrative and judicial challenges, which can delay and protract the process for obtaining and implementing permits and can also add significant costs and uncertainty.\nExisting and future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating costs or construction costs and restrictions.\nOur business is now and will in the future be subject to extensive federal, international, state and local laws and regulations both in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we operate that regulate and restrict, among other things, the siting and design of our facilities, discharges to air, land and water, with particular respect to the protection of human health, the environment and natural resources from risks associated with storing, receiving and transporting LNG; the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous waste and petroleum products; and remediation associated with the release of hazardous substances. For example, the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (\u201cPHMSA\u201d) has promulgated detailed regulations governing LNG facilities under its jurisdiction to address LNG facility siting, design, construction, equipment, operations, maintenance, personnel qualifications and training, fire protection and security. State and local regulators can impose similar siting, design, construction and operational requirements.\nFederal and state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct, for the release of certain types or quantities of hazardous substances into the environment. As the owner and operator of our facilities, we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up any such hazardous substances that may be released into the environment at or from our facilities and for resulting damage to natural resources.\nMany of these laws and regulations, such as the CAA and the CWA, and analogous state laws and regulations, restrict or prohibit the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be emitted into the environment in connection with the construction and operation of our facilities, and require us to obtain and maintain permits and provide governmental authorities with access to our facilities for inspection and reports related to compliance. Relevant local authorities may also require us to obtain and maintain permits associated with the construction and operation of our facilities, including with respect to land use approvals. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial liabilities, fines and penalties or capital expenditures related to pollution control equipment and restrictions or curtailment of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOther future legislation and regulations could cause additional expenditures, restrictions and delays in our business and to our proposed construction, the extent of which cannot be predicted and which may require us to limit substantially, delay or cease operations in some circumstances. In October 2017, the U.S. Government Accountability Office issued a legal determination that a 2013 interagency guidance document was a \u201crule\u201d subject to the Congressional Review Act (\u201cCRA\u201d). This legal determination could open a broader set of agency guidance documents to potential disapproval and invalidation under the CRA, potentially increasing the likelihood that laws and regulations applicable to our business will become subject to revised interpretations in the future that we cannot predict. Revised, reinterpreted or additional laws and regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating or construction costs and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nGreenhouse Gases/Climate Change. From time to time, there may be federal and state regulatory and policy initiatives to reduce GHG emissions in the United States from a variety of sources. Other federal and state initiatives are being considered or may be considered in the future to address GHG emissions through, for example, United States treaty commitments or other international agreements, direct regulation, a carbon emissions tax, or cap-and-trade programs.\nResponding to scientific reports regarding threats posed by global climate change, the U.S. Congress has in the past considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. In addition, some states and foreign jurisdictions have individually or in regional cooperation, imposed restrictions on GHG emissions under various policies and approaches, including establishing a cap on emissions, requiring efficiency measures, or providing incentives for pollution reduction, use of renewable energy sources, or use of replacement fuels with lower carbon content.\nThe adoption and implementation of any U.S. federal, state or local regulations or foreign regulations imposing obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur significant costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with their operations or could adversely affect demand for natural gas and natural gas products. The potential increase in our operating costs could include new costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our GHG emissions, pay taxes related to our GHG emissions, and administer and manage a GHG emissions program. We may not be able to recover such increased costs through increases in customer prices or rates. In\naddition, changes in regulatory policies that result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to GHGs, or restrict their use, may reduce volumes available to us for processing, transportation, marketing and storage. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, due to concerns over climate change, numerous countries around the world have adopted or are considering adopting laws or regulations to reduce GHG emissions. In December 2015, the U.S. and 195 other nations attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference adopted the Paris Agreement on global climate change, which establishes a universal framework for addressing GHG emissions based on nationally determined contributions. The Paris Agreement calls for zero net anthropogenic GHG emission to be reached during the second half of the 21st century. The Paris Agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions but rather includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. It also creates a process for participating countries to review and increase their intended emissions reduction goals every five years. Although the United States became a party to the Paris Agreement in April 2016, the Trump administration subsequently announced in June 2017 its intention either to withdraw from the Paris Agreement or renegotiate more favorable terms. However, the Paris Agreement stipulates that participating countries must wait four years before withdrawing from the agreement. It is not possible to know how quickly renewable energy technologies may advance, but the increased use of renewable energy could ultimately reduce future demand for hydrocarbons. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFossil Fuels. Our business activities depend upon a sufficient and reliable supply of natural gas feedstock, and are therefore subject to concerns in certain sectors of the public about the exploration, production and transportation of natural gas and other fossil fuels and the consumption of fossil fuels more generally. Legislative and regulatory action, and possible litigation, in response to such public concerns may also adversely affect our operations. We may be subject to future laws, regulations, or actions to address such public concern with fossil fuel generation, distribution and combustion, greenhouse gases and the effects of global climate change. Our customers may also move away from using fossil fuels such as LNG for their power generation needs for reputational or perceived risk-related reasons. These matters represent uncertainties in the operation and management of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Inherent in an Investment in Us\nWe expect that we may incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe expect that we may continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. The net losses the Company incurs may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022\nseek to identify additional expansion of business operation opportunities;\n\u2022\ndevelop manufacturing processes and distribution processes;\n\u2022\nestablish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize its business and products;\n\u2022\nhire additional personnel;\n\u2022\nadd operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our business development and planned future commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022\ncontinue to operate as a public company.\nTo become and remain profitable, our company must develop and execute its business plan. This will require it to be successful in a range of challenging activities. Our company may never succeed in these activities and, even if it does, may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. If our company does achieve profitability, it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our company\u2019s failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of the company and could impair its ability to raise capital, maintain its existing business operations and development efforts, expand its business or continue its operations and may require it to raise additional capital that may dilute the ownership interest of common stockholders. A decline in the value of the company could also cause stockholders to lose all or part of their investment.\nOur company may need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be compelled to delay, reduce or eliminate portions of its existing business operations and development efforts.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in parallel with our ongoing activities. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate parts of our existing business and development efforts.\nBased upon current operating plans, our net cash to fund our operations will be challenging. We may need to raise additional funds to pursue business activities and opportunities. Additionally, our funding needs may fluctuate significantly based on a number\nof factors. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders or restrict our operations.\nWe expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of additional equity offerings and debt financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting its ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts.\nFollowing the Share Exchange, the market price of our common stock declined, and we expect the stock price of our common stock to continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could continue to fluctuate. Market prices for securities of energy producers, distributors and other businesses in the energy generation and distribution industry have been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of the common stock of the Company to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory approvals for LNG business expansions, and delays or failures to obtain such approvals;\n\u2022\nfailure of any of our business strategy to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022\nissues in developing and expanding our LNG infrastructure and facilities, and service and delivery operations;\n\u2022\nthe results of our current and any future business operations related to LNG distribution or production;\n\u2022\nthe entry into, or termination of, key agreements, including key commercial partner agreements;\n\u2022\nthe initiation of, material developments in, or conclusion of litigation to enforce or defend any of our rights under our material contracts or defend against the rights of others;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of technological innovations or new energy products or methods of distribution that compete with our potential products;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our research and development expenditures; and\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. In addition, we may become involved in securities class action litigation or shareholder litigation in connection with the Share Exchange. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they publish negative evaluations or recommendations, our share price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be impacted by the availability or lack of research and reports that third-party industry or financial analysts publish about us. There are many large, publicly-traded companies active in the energy and power generation and distribution industry, which may mean it will be less likely that we receive widespread analyst coverage. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If we do not receive\nadequate coverage by reputable analysts that have an understanding of our business and industry, we could fail to achieve visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d within the meaning of the Exchange Act. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are subject to lesser disclosure obligations in our SEC filings compared to other issuers. Specifically, \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings, are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d may make it harder for investors to analyze our operating results and financial prospects and make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs a result of the Share Exchange, Casey Crenshaw has voting control over our company.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Casey Crenshaw has beneficial ownership of 77.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Crenshaw may control all matters that require stockholder approval, as well as its management and affairs. For example, Mr. Crenshaw may unilaterally approve the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership control may:\n\u2022\ndelay, defer or prevent a change in control;\n\u2022\nentrench its management and the board of directors; or\n\u2022\nimpede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving the company that other stockholders may desire.\nThe failure to integrate successfully the businesses of Stabilis Energy, LLC and American Electric in the expected timeframe could adversely affect our future results.\nFollowing the Share Exchange, the continued operation of our business is, and will continue to be, complex. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of American Electric and Stabilis Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries.\nThe failure to integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in our failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Share Exchange.\nPotential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nusing our Company\u2019s cash and other assets efficiently to develop our business;\n\u2022\nappropriately managing our liabilities;\n\u2022\npotential unknown or currently unquantifiable liabilities associated with the Share Exchange and our operations; and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by focusing on the integration of operations following the Share Exchange.\nWe will continue to incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nWe incur and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that Stabilis Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries did not incur as private companies, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also incur costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. These rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for us to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d or \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d) or as executive officers, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and could cause our business or stock price to suffer.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and our ability to operate its business could be harmed.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nIn addition, we are required to be compliant with public company internal control requirements mandated under Section 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We are implementing measures designed to improve our internal controls over financial reporting, including the hiring of accounting personnel and establishing new accounting and financial reporting procedures to establish an appropriate level of internal controls over financial reporting. However, we cannot provide assurances that we will be successful in doing so. If we are unable to successfully implement internal controls over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting, and our stock price, may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the applicable stock exchange listing requirements.\nImplementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify existing processes and take significant time to complete. These changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase operating costs and harm the business. In addition, investors\u2019 perceptions that our internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm our stock price.\nIn addition to Mr. Crenshaw\u2019s ability to control all matters that require stockholder approval, provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Florida law could make an acquisition of the Company, which may be beneficial to its stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because the Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by stockholders to replace or remove the current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the Board of Directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of our directors to be fixed only by resolution of our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting or by our stockholders by written consent of the holders of over 50% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast;\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a shareholder rights plan, or so-called \u201cpoison pill,\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nrequire the proposal of our Board of Directors and the approval of the holders of over 50% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend our charter; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of over 50% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend our bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Florida, we are governed by the provisions of Section 607.0901 and 607.0102 of the Florida Business Corporation Act.\nIn general, Section 607.0901 regulates certain transactions between a corporation and an \u201cinterested shareholder,\u201d one who beneficially owns more than ten percent of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting shares. The statute provides significant protection to minority shareholders by assuring that the transactions covered by the statute are either (a) procedurally fair (i.e., the transaction is approved by disinterested directors or disinterested shareholders) or (b) substantively fair (i.e., result in a fair price to the shareholders).\nIn general, Section 607.0902 focuses on the acquisition of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d in an issuing public corporation. When control shares are acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition,\u201d the shares do not have voting rights. Voting rights may be restored only if the bidder files an acquiring person statement and requests a shareholder meeting to vote on whether the bidder\u2019s shares should be accorded voting rights. Voting rights are restored only to the extent approved by the disinterested shareholders (which excludes both the bidder and management shareholders). Alternatively, the bidder\u2019s shares will have voting rights if the acquisition is approved by\nthe target company\u2019s board of directors. As a result, mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts of us may be discouraged or prevented.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe current expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we will retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the board of directors deems relevant. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain, if any, for any stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nOur present and future success depends on key members of our management team and certain employees and our ability to retain such key members, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nWe are highly dependent on principal members of our management team and certain of our other employees. The loss of the services of any member of our management team could disrupt our operations, adversely impact the achievement of our objections and increase our exposure to the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We have not entered into employment agreements with Mr. Reddinger, Mr. Puhala and other principal members of our management team, and any of them could leave our employment at any time.\nOur success will also depend on pre-existing relationships with third parties, which relationships may be affected by the Share Exchange. Any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success will be dependent on the ability to maintain and renew relationships with pre-existing third-party relationships. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain pre-existing business relationships, or enter into or maintain new business relationships, on acceptable terms, if at all. The failure to maintain important pre-existing third-party relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 86812, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "SLNG"}
