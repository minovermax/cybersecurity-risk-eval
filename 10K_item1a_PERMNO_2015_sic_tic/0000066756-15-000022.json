{"cik": "66756", "company": "ALLETE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties discussed below could materially affect our business, financial position and results of operations and should be carefully considered by stakeholders. The risks and uncertainties in this section are not the only ones we face; additional risks and uncertainties that we are not presently aware of, or that we currently consider immaterial, may also affect our business operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Accordingly, the risks described below should be carefully considered together with other information set forth in this report and in future reports that are filed with the SEC.\nOur results of operations could be negatively impacted if our Large Power Customers experience an economic downturn, incur work stoppages, fail to compete effectively in the economy or experience decreased demand for their product.\nMinnesota Power\u2019s 10 Large Power Customers accounted for 28 percent of our 2014 consolidated operating revenue (31 percent in 2013; 33 percent in 2012), of which one of these customers accounted for 10.8 percent of consolidated revenue in 2014 (12.0 percent in 2013; 12.3 percent in 2012). These customers are involved in cyclical industries that by their nature are adversely impacted by economic downturns and are subject to strong competition in the marketplace. Many of our Large Power Customers also have unionized workforces which put them at risk for work stoppages. In addition, the North American paper and pulp industry also faces declining demand due to the impact of electronic substitution for print and changing customer needs.\nAccordingly, if our customers experience an economic downturn, incur a work stoppage (including strikes, lock-outs or other events), fail to compete effectively in the economy, or experience decreased demand for their product, there could be material adverse effects on their operations and, consequently, this could have a negative impact on our results of operations if we are unable to remarket at similar prices the energy that would otherwise have been sold to such Large Power Customers.\nOur utility operations are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework under federal and state laws as well as regulations imposed by other organizations that may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework imposed under federal and state law including regulations administered by the FERC, the MPUC, the MPCA, the PSCW, the NDPSC and the EPA as well as regulations administered by other organizations including the NERC. These laws and regulations relate to allowed rates of return, capital structure, financings, rate and cost structure, acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities, construction and operation of generation, transmission and distribution facilities (including the ongoing maintenance and reliable operation of such facilities), recovery of purchased power costs and capital investments, approval of integrated resource plans and present or prospective wholesale and retail competition, among other things. Energy policy initiatives at the state or federal level could increase incentives for distributed generation, municipal utility ownership, or local initiatives could introduce generation or distribution requirements, that could change the current integrated utility model. Our transmission systems and electric generation facilities are subject to the NERC mandatory reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards. Compliance with these standards may lead to increased operating costs and capital expenditures. If it was determined that we were not in compliance with these mandatory reliability standards or other statutes, rules and orders, we could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThese laws and regulations significantly influence our operations and may affect our ability to recover costs from our customers. We are required to have numerous permits, licenses, approvals and certificates from the agencies and other organizations that regulate our business. We believe we have obtained the necessary permits, licenses, approvals and certificates for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, we are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of these agencies and other organizations. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur ability to obtain rate adjustments to maintain reasonable rates of return depends upon regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations, and we cannot provide assurance that rate adjustments will be obtained or reasonable authorized rates of return on capital will be earned. Minnesota Power and SWL&P, from time to time, file rate cases with, or otherwise seek cost recovery authorization from, federal and state regulatory authorities. If Minnesota Power and SWL&P do not receive an adequate amount of rate relief in rate cases, including if rates are reduced, if increased rates are not approved on a timely basis or costs are otherwise unable to be recovered through rates, or if cost recovery is not granted at the requested level, we may experience a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are unable to predict the impact on our business and results of operations from future legislation or regulatory activities of any of these agencies or organizations.\nALLETE, Inc. 2014 Form 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nOur operations pose certain environmental risks that could materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations, including effects of environmental laws and regulations, physical risks associated with climate change and initiatives designed to reduce the impact of GHG emissions.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations, including air quality, water quality and usage, waste management, reclamation, hazardous wastes, avian mortality and natural resources. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, environmental emission allowance trading, operating and other costs, as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations, particularly with regard to laws relating to power plant emissions, coal ash, water discharge and wind generation facilities.\nThese laws and regulations could restrict the output of some existing facilities, limit the use of some fuels in the production of electricity, require the installation of additional pollution control equipment, require participation in environmental emission allowance trading, and/or lead to other environmental considerations and costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and results of operations.\nThese laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Both governmental authorities and private parties may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations. We cannot predict the financial or operational outcome of any related litigation that may arise.\nExisting environmental regulations may be revised and new regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations which result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from customers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe scientific community generally accepts that emissions of GHG are linked to global climate change. Physical risks of climate change, such as more frequent or more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, changes to ground and surface water availability, and other related phenomena, could affect some, or all, of our operations. Severe weather or other natural disasters could be destructive, which could result in increased costs. An extreme weather event within our utility service areas can also directly affect our capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment. These all have the potential to materially adversely affect our business and operations.\nProposals for voluntary initiatives to reduce GHGs such as CO2, a by-product of burning fossil fuels, have been discussed within Minnesota, among a group of Midwestern states that includes Minnesota and in the United States Congress. In June 2013, President Obama announced a Climate Action Plan (CAP) that calls for implementation of measures that reduce GHG emissions in the U.S., emphasizing means such as expanded deployment of renewable energy resources, energy and resource conservation, energy efficiency improvements and a shift to fuel sources that have lower emissions. Certain portions of the CAP directly address electric utility GHG emissions. The implementation of the CAP could have a material impact on our results of operations if additional capital expenditures and operating costs are required and if those costs are not fully recovered from customers.\nIn June 2014, the EPA announced a proposed rule under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act for existing power plants (CPP). In the CPP, the EPA proposes to set state-specific rate-based goals for CO2 emissions from the power sector that the EPA maintains are achievable if a state undertakes a combination of measures across its power sector that constitute the EPA\u2019s guideline for a Best System of Emission Reductions. Using 2012 emissions data, the EPA derived interim goals for states to be met over the years 2020-2029, as well as a final goal to be met in 2030 and thereafter. Under the CPP, each state would be required to develop a state implementation plan by June 30, 2016. The implementation of the CPP could have a material impact on our results of operations if additional capital expenditures and operating costs are required and if those costs are not fully recovered from customers.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding whether new laws or regulations will be adopted to reduce GHGs and what effect any such laws or regulations would have on us. In 2014, coal was the primary fuel source for 85 percent of the energy produced by our generating facilities. Future limits on GHG emissions would likely require us to incur significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs, which if significant, could result in the closure of certain coal-fired energy centers, impairment of assets, or otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if implementation costs are not fully recoverable from customers.\nALLETE, Inc. 2014 Form 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nWe cannot predict the amount or timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of uncertainty as to applicable regulations or requirements. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties. Violations of certain environmental statutes, rules and regulations could expose ALLETE to third party disputes and potentially significant monetary penalties, as well as other sanctions for non-compliance.\nWe rely on access to financing sources and capital markets. If we do not have access to sufficient capital in the amounts and at the times needed, our ability to execute our business plans, make capital expenditures or pursue other strategic actions that we may otherwise rely on for future growth could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on access to financing sources and capital markets as sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by our cash flow from operations. If we are not able to access capital on satisfactory terms, or at all, the ability to maintain our business or to implement our business plans may be materially adversely affected. Market disruptions or a downgrade of our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or materially adversely affect our ability to access capital markets. Such disruptions could include a significant economic downturn, the financial distress of non-affiliated electric utility companies or financial services companies, a deterioration in capital market conditions, or volatility in commodity prices.\nThe operation and maintenance of our electric generation and transmission facilities are subject to operational risks that could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe operation of generating facilities involves many risks, including start-up operations risks, breakdown or failure of facilities, the dependence on a specific fuel source, inadequate fuel supply, or availability of fuel transportation, or the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural events, as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. A significant portion of our facilities were constructed many years ago. In particular, older generating equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to continue operating at peak efficiency. Generation and transmission facilities and equipment are also likely to require periodic upgrades and improvements due to changing environmental standards and technological advances. We could be subject to costs associated with any unexpected failure to produce and/or deliver power, including failure caused by breakdown or forced outage, as well as repairing damage to facilities due to storms, natural disasters, wars, sabotage, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events.\nOur ability to successfully and timely complete capital improvements to existing facilities or other capital projects is contingent upon many variables.\nWe are, or may be, engaged in significant capital improvements to its existing electric generation facilities, including the installation of pollution control equipment and the conversion of certain coal-fired electric generation facilities to natural gas. We are also engaged in development and/or construction of new wind and transmission facilities. Should any such efforts be unsuccessful or not completed in a timely manner, we could be subject to additional costs or impairments which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operation.\nOur electrical generating operations may not have access to adequate and reliable transmission and distribution facilities necessary to deliver electricity to our customers.\nWe depend on our own transmission and distribution facilities, and facilities owned by other utilities, to deliver the electricity produced and sold to our customers, and to other energy suppliers. If transmission capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver electricity may be limited. We may have to forgo sales or may have to buy more expensive wholesale electricity that is available in the capacity-constrained area. In addition, any infrastructure failure that interrupts or impairs delivery of electricity to our customers could negatively impact the satisfaction of our customers, which could have a material impact on our business, operations or results of operations.\nALLETE, Inc. 2014 Form 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nThe price of electricity and fuel may be volatile.\nVolatility in market prices for electricity and fuel could materially adversely impact our financial position and results of operations and may result from:\n\u2022\nsevere or unexpected weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nseasonality;\n\u2022\nchanges in electricity usage;\n\u2022\ntransmission or transportation constraints, inoperability or inefficiencies;\n\u2022\navailability of competitively priced alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\nchanges in supply and demand for energy;\n\u2022\nchanges in power production capacity;\n\u2022\noutages at our generating facilities or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\navailability of fuel transportation;\n\u2022\nchanges in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal, crude oil and refined products;\n\u2022\nwars, sabotage, terrorist acts or other catastrophic events; and\n\u2022\nfederal, state, local and foreign energy, environmental, or other regulation and legislation.\nSince fluctuations in fuel expense related to our regulated utility operations are passed on to customers through our fuel clause, risk of volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity primarily impacts our sales to Other Power Suppliers.\nThe inability to attract and retain a qualified workforce including, but not limited to, executive officers, key employees and employees with specialized skills, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe success of our business heavily depends on the leadership of our executive officers and key employees to implement our business strategy. The inability to maintain a qualified workforce including, but not limited to, executive officers, key employees and employees with specialized skills, may negatively affect our ability to service our existing or new customers, or successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. Personnel costs may increase due to competitive pressures or terms of collective bargaining agreements with union employees. We believe we have good relations with our members of IBEW Local 31 and IBEW Local 1593, and have contracts in place through January 31, 2018, and March 31, 2019, respectively.\nMarket performance and other changes could decrease the value of pension and postretirement benefit plan assets, which may result in significant additional funding requirements and increased annual expenses.\nThe performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. We have significant obligations to these plans and the trusts hold significant assets. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected rates of return. A decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets would increase the funding requirements under our benefit plans if asset returns do not recover. Additionally, our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Our pension and postretirement benefit plan costs are generally recoverable in our electric rates as allowed by our regulators. However, there is no certainty that regulators will continue to allow recovery of these rising costs in the future.\nEmerging technologies may materially adversely affect our business operations.\nWhile the pace of technology development has been increasing, the basic structure of energy production, sale and delivery upon which our business model is based has remained substantially unchanged. The development of new commercially viable technology in areas such as distributed generation, energy storage and energy conservation could significantly decrease demand for our current products and services.\nALLETE, Inc. 2014 Form 10-K\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (Continued)\nWe may be vulnerable to acts of terrorism or cyber attacks.\nOur generation plants, fuel storage facilities, and transmission and distribution facilities may be targets of terrorist activities, including cybersecurity attacks, which could result in the disruption of our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products. We could be subject to computer viruses, terrorism, theft and sabotage, which may also disrupt our operations and/or materially adversely impact our results of operations. We operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Our technology systems may be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes. If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe inability to successfully manage and grow our Energy Infrastructure and Related Services businesses could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur Energy Infrastructure and Related Services businesses consist of ALLETE Clean Energy, U.S. Water Services and BNI Coal. If we are unable to successfully integrate the U.S. Water Services\u2019 business we acquired in February 2015, this could materially adversely affect our results of operations. U.S. Water Services principally relies upon recurring revenues from a diverse mix of industrial customers. If U.S. Water Services is unable to retain its existing customers and to add new industrial customers, this would prevent us from profitably operating this business and prevent us from achieving our future growth expectations.\nIn addition, ALLETE Clean Energy\u2019s wind facilities are parties to long-term PPAs which expire prior to the end of the estimated useful lives of the facilities. If there is not a market for this energy subsequent to the expiration of the PPAs, this could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe results from any acquisitions of assets or businesses made by us, or strategic investments that we may make, may not achieve the results that we expect or seek and may materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAcquisitions are subject to uncertainties. If we are unable to successfully manage future acquisitions or strategic investments, this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Our actual results may also differ from our expectations due to factors such as the ability to obtain timely regulatory or governmental approvals, integration and operational issues and the ability to retain management and other key personnel.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our strategic objectives of growing load at our utilities if current or potential industrial or municipal customers are unable to successfully implement expansion plans, including the inability to obtain necessary governmental permits.\nAs part of our long-term strategy, we pursue new wholesale and retail loads in and around our service territory. Currently, there are several companies in northeastern Minnesota that are in the process of developing natural resource-based projects that represent long-term growth potential and load diversity for Minnesota Power. These projects may include construction of new facilities and restarts of old facilities, both of which require permitting and/or approvals to be obtained before the projects can be successfully implemented. If a project does not obtain any necessary governmental (including environmental) permits and approvals, our long-term strategy and thus our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, even if the necessary permits and approvals are obtained, our long-term strategy could be materially adversely impacted if these customers are unable to successfully implement expansion plans.\nReal estate market conditions where our Florida real estate investment is located may affect our strategy to sell our Florida real estate.\nWe intend to sell our Florida land assets when opportunities arise. However, adverse market conditions could impact our future operations, which could result in little to no sales while still incurring operating expenses such as community development district assessments and property taxes, as well as continued annual net operating losses at ALLETE Properties. Furthermore, weak market conditions could put the properties at risk for impairment which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.\nALLETE, Inc. 2014 Form 10-K", "PERMNO": 24248, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "ALE"}
