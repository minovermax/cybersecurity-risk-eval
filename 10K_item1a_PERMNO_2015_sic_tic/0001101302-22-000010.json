Infection rates vary across the countries in which we operate. As we are currently experiencing with the omicron variant, there may be additional waves of infection, which could be more contagious than prior waves. We have taken proactive measures to protect the safety of our employees at all of our global facilities. Governmental authorities continue to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, masking recommendations and mandates, vaccine recommendations and mandates, limits on gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. Measures providing for business shutdowns have generally excluded certain essential services, including critical infrastructure and the businesses that support that critical infrastructure. While all of our facilities currently remain operational, these measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, as well as those of our customers, suppliers and other third parties with which we do business. For example, in March 2020 the government of Malaysia issued an order that significantly reduced the number of employees who could be physically present to operate our Malaysian plant, which temporarily reduced the productivity of that plant. During 2021, we experienced brief interruptions in operations at several of our sites across the world.\nConstraints and limitations imposed on our operations or modifications on our business practices, or those of our suppliers, may limit our ability to meet customer demand, cause us to increase our safety stock of certain materials, reduce our productivity, slow or diminish our research and development activities, make our products less competitive, or cause our customers to seek alternative suppliers and delay customer qualification activities, any of which could harm our business, reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, employees working remotely may not be able to maintain the same level of productivity and efficiency and employees may face additional demands on their time, such as increased responsibilities resulting from school closures or the illness of family members. Absenteeism caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase in the future and may harm our productivity. We have incurred and may continue to incur incremental compensation expense related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, have in certain instances resulted in higher costs and delays both in obtaining materials and shipping finished goods to customers. The pandemic and related restrictions have placed considerable strain on us, our suppliers and other third parties with which we do business. The increased reliance on remote access to information systems by us and our customers, suppliers and other third parties with which we do business increases the risk of exposure of our information and systems to potential cybersecurity breaches. There is no certainty that additional measures required by government authorities or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and we may be unable to respond to the needs of our global business. Furthermore, we cannot predict with certainty the impact that future government, restrictions, mandates or related measures may have on our workforce and operations. These may require significant time and attention from management to implement, increase our operating costs, reduce productivity, result in attrition of our employees or hinder our ability to recruit and retain our employees.\nThe degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of outbreaks, their severity, potential additional waves of infection, the emergence of more virulent or more dangerous strains of the virus, the actions to mitigate the virus and its impact, the development, distribution, efficacy and acceptance of vaccines and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The prolonged implementation, or re-implementation, of measures by governments to try to contain the virus may lead to fatigue in complying with COVID-19 restrictions among the public, which in turn may further exacerbate its spread. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic makes it more difficult for us to forecast demand and provide guidance for upcoming periods. Accordingly, any guidance we provide is likely to be less reliable than usual, and actual results are more likely to differ from any such guidance. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\nDeclines in the semiconductor industry or worldwide economic conditions may cause demand for our products to decrease and may adversely affect our business.\nDeclines in industry or worldwide economic conditions may adversely affect our business. Our revenue is primarily dependent upon demand from semiconductor manufacturers, which is largely driven by the current and anticipated demand for electronic products that utilize semiconductors. Despite recent increases in demand for semiconductors in applications such as smartphones, 5G wireless technology, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, machine learning and artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and virtual reality, the semiconductor industry has historically been, and is likely to continue to be, cyclical with periodic significant downturns, resulting in significantly decreased demand for products such as ours. While demand for semiconductors has remained robust, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and contributed to substantial volatility and inflationary pressure in global markets, including those in which we participate. We anticipate that the pandemic will continue to adversely affect the global economy, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession, each of which may adversely affect our business. We have previously experienced significant revenue deterioration and operating losses due to severe downturns in the semiconductor industry, which often occur suddenly. The semiconductor industry is also affected by seasonal shifts in demand. We are unable to predict the timing, duration or severity of any future downturns in the semiconductor industry. As a result, we could underperform the market or our peers.\nDuring downturns and periods of soft demand, our revenue is reduced and we typically experience greater pricing pressure and shifts in product and customer mix, which often adversely affect our gross margin and net income. Furthermore, to remain competitive, we must maintain a satisfactory level of engineering, research and development activity, invest in our infrastructure and maintain the ability to respond to any increases in demand and, as a result, a lower volume of sales can have a large and disproportionate impact on our profitability. Even moderate seasonality can cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from one period to the next. Uncertain and volatile economic, political, public health or business conditions in any of our key sales regions can cause or exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and have historically impacted customer demand for our products. These conditions can cause material adverse changes in our results of operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022a decline in demand for our products would have an immediate impact on our revenues;\n\u2022an increase in reserves for accounts receivable due to our customers\u2019 inability to pay us;\n\u2022lower utilization of our manufacturing facilities, which could lead to lower margins;\n\u2022an increase in write-offs for excess or obsolete inventory that we cannot sell;\n\u2022potential impairment charges relating to goodwill, intangible assets, manufacturing equipment or other long-lived assets, to the extent that any downturn indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable;\n\u2022greater challenges in forecasting operating results, making business decisions and identifying and prioritizing business risks; and\n\u2022additional cost reduction efforts, including additional restructuring activities, which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities.\nWe anticipate that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may cause us to experience at least some of these adverse changes, but we cannot predict the timing or degree to which they will occur, if at all.\nOur revenues and operating results are variable.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. We manage our expenses based in part on our expectations of future revenues. Because some of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, a change in the timing of revenue or the amount of profit we generate from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular period. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include:\n\u2022economic conditions in the semiconductor industry or in the other industries we serve;\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, the semiconductor industry, the other industries we serve, our manufacturing capabilities or our supply chain;\n\u2022the size and timing of customer orders;\n\u2022consolidation of our customers, which could impact their purchasing decisions and negatively affect our revenues;\n\u2022procurement shortages;\n\u2022the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations;\n\u2022manufacturing difficulties;\n\u2022additional expenses we would expect to incur in our efforts to respond promptly to any supply shortages, manufacturing difficulties or other supplier problems;\n\u2022decisions to increase or accelerate our purchasing of raw materials, components or other supplies in an effort to mitigate supply risk;\n\u2022customer decisions to decelerate orders in order to draw down their inventory;\n\u2022customer cancellations of or delays in shipments, installations or customer acceptances or, alternatively, acceleration of orders from customers to increase their inventory;\n\u2022our customers\u2019 rate of replacement of our consumable products;\n\u2022changes in average selling prices, customer mix and product mix;\n\u2022our ability to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced and competitive products in a timely manner;\n\u2022our competitors\u2019 introduction of new products;\n\u2022legal or technical challenges to our products or technologies;\n\u2022disruptions in transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply, including strikes, acts of God, wars, terrorist activities and natural or man-made disasters;\n\u2022legal, tax, accounting or regulatory changes (including changes in import/export regulations and tariffs) or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements;\n\u2022changes in our estimated tax rate; and\n\u2022foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is likely to exacerbate the adverse impact of many of these factors on our revenues and results of operations, at least in the short term.\nThe industries we serve are constantly evolving, and any failure to manage our business effectively during periods of rapid change may adversely affect our business performance and results of operations.\nIntense competition in the semiconductor industry often leads to rapid changes in products and technology. These changes can significantly alter demand for our products and the amount and mix of customers\u2019 spending on our products and solutions can significantly impact our results of operations. Changes in demand may arise from factors such as advances in fabrication processes, new and emerging technologies, end-user demand, customers\u2019 production capacity and customers\u2019 capacity utilization. We must accurately forecast demand for each of our products and effectively manage our resources and production capacity across our various businesses. Although we regularly reassess our allocation of resources in response to the changing business environment, we may incur unexpected or additional costs to align our operations with demand, If we do not adequately anticipate changes in our business environment, we may lack the infrastructure, manufacturing capacity and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity too rapidly, resulting in excess fixed costs. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, our gross margins and earnings will usually be adversely impacted. Especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated the correct mix of industry changes. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on our management\u2019s ability to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.\nOur ability to increase sales of our products, particularly our capital equipment products, depends in part upon our ability in a very short timeframe to ramp up our manufacturing capacity and to mobilize our supply chain. If we are unable to expand our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, manage the expansion effectively and obtain larger quantities of raw materials, our customers could obtain products from our competitors, which would reduce our market share, harm our reputation as a trusted partner and impact our results of operations. These challenges have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, we faced several instances where our manufacturing capacity was constrained and the lead time to manufacture and deliver our customers\u2019 products was extended. If we are unable to meet our customers\u2019 demand for our products or deliver our products within their required lead times, our customers may seek to replace us with alternative suppliers. Additionally, although we have been increasing inventory levels to support strong demand in a challenging supply chain environment, historically we have operated our business on a just-in-time shipment basis with a modest level of inventory, ordering supplies and planning production based on internal demand forecasts. The failure to accurately forecast demand for our products, in terms of both volume and product type, has in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, delays in product shipments and disappointment of customer expectations, as well as an increased risk of excess and obsolete inventory.\nWe depend on single and limited source suppliers, and an interruption in our ordinary sources of supply could affect our ability to manufacture our products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on single or limited source suppliers for certain raw materials that are critical to the manufacturing of our products, such as plastic polymers, filtration membranes, petroleum coke and other materials. If we were to lose any one of these sources, it could be difficult for us to find an alternative supplier and we would need to qualify this new source through our customers\u2019 rigorous qualification processes. Although we seek to reduce our dependence on single and limited source suppliers, the partial or complete loss of any of these sources could interrupt our manufacturing operations and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAt times, we have experienced a limited supply of certain raw materials, which has resulted in delays, lost revenue, increased costs and risks associated with qualifying products that are manufactured using such new raw materials with our customers. Events such as an industry-wide increase in demand for, or the discontinuation of, raw materials used in our products could harm our ability to acquire sufficient quantities of such raw materials, and our manufacturing operations may be interrupted. For example, in 2021 we experienced a disruption in the supply of certain ceramic material for use in our coatings business in our SCEM division when the supplier was unable to produce these materials at the required specifications. When these events occur, we work collaboratively with the supplier to determine the root cause and to solve the manufacturing issue in order to reestablish the supply of these materials. We may be unable to successfully reestablish our raw material supply in the future, in which case shortages may adversely affect our operations. Additionally, our suppliers may not have the capacity to meet increases in our demand for raw materials, in turn, making us unable to meet demand from our customers. Prices for our raw materials can vary widely. While we have long-term arrangements with certain key suppliers that fix our price for the purchase of certain raw materials, if the cost of our raw materials increases, as we have seen recently due to inflationary pressure, and we are unable to correspondingly increase the sales price of our products or find other cost savings, our profit margins will decline.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a difficult and dynamic supply chain and global logistics environment, and we have experienced instances of raw material constraints and shortages, higher freight costs and delivery delays in both inbound shipments of raw materials and outgoing shipments of finished products to customers. If our suppliers or sub-suppliers are unable to maintain their operations or COVID-19 related restrictions become more severe, we may encounter difficulties obtaining raw materials, which may cause us to fail to meet customer demand or require us to pay higher prices for these materials, either of which could harm our business and profitability. To mitigate the risk of potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2021, we chose to increase certain inventory levels, causing us to hold more inventory than we might have otherwise maintained. Additionally, an economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise could harm the financial health of our suppliers and sub-suppliers. Although we regularly monitor the financial health of companies in our supply chain, financial hardship on our suppliers or sub-suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to obtain raw materials or components or adversely affect our operations. We may increase our safety stocks of raw materials or components or alter our payment terms with certain suppliers, including prepaying for raw materials, any of which could put downward pressure on our cash flow.\nWe are exposed to the risks of operating a global business as a significant amount of our sales and manufacturing activity occur outside the United States.\nSales to customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 77%, 75% and 76% of our net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a majority of our net sales. In addition, a number of our key domestic customers derive a significant portion of their revenues from sales in international markets. We also manufacture a significant portion of our products outside the United States and depend on international suppliers for many of our parts and raw materials. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities in both sales and manufacturing internationally. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks and potential costs that could adversely affect our revenue and profitability, including:\n\u2022border closures, travel bans, entry limitations or inspections and other restrictions on the international movement of goods, including actions to limit the export of goods in order to secure a domestic supply in light of actual or anticipated global shortages, as well as the potential exercise of governmental power to requisition or prioritize the production of specified goods or to commandeer facilities in the public interest, such as in the effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, any of which could adversely affect our ability to obtain supplies and deliver our products to customers;\n\u2022the implementation of laws, rules, regulations, policies and other government actions, such as \u201ctrade wars,\u201d tariffs, sanctions or other changes in international trade requirements that affect our business and that of our customers and suppliers, any of which could impose additional costs on our operations and limit our ability to operate our business;\n\u2022challenges in hiring and integrating workers in different countries;\n\u2022challenges in managing a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, along with differing employment practices and labor issues;\n\u2022challenges of maintaining appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls and complying with legal, environmental, health and safety, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements that vary by jurisdiction, including new and evolving requirements for social distancing and other measures to minimize the spread of COVID-19;\n\u2022challenges in developing relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;\n\u2022fluctuating pricing and availability of raw materials and supply chain interruptions or slowdowns, including as a result of difficulties, financial or otherwise, faced by segments of the transportation industry;\n\u2022public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022expense and complexity of complying with U.S. and foreign import and export regulations, including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses;\n\u2022fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies that are important to our business, including the Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Korean won, Chinese renminbi, Singapore dollar, Malaysian ringgit, Canadian dollar or Israeli shekel, which could cause our sales and profitability to decline;\n\u2022liability for foreign taxes assessed at rates higher than those applicable to our domestic operations;\n\u2022challenges and costs associated with the protection of our intellectual property throughout the world;\n\u2022customer or government efforts to encourage operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea or China, including efforts to develop and grow local competitors, require local manufacturing, and provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors; and\n\u2022political and economic instability and uncertainty, which may result in severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of sovereign debt, declining valuation of certain investments, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, volatility in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability.\nIn the past, these factors have disrupted our operations and increased our costs, and we expect that these factors will continue to do so in the future.\nTariffs, export controls and other trade laws and restrictions resulting from international trade disputes, strained international relations and changes to foreign and national security policy, especially as they relate to China, could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nTariffs, additional taxes, trade barriers and other measures, particularly those arising out of relations between the United States and China, may increase costs of raw materials and our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, both the United States and China have implemented several rounds of tariffs and retaliations with respect to certain products imported from the other country, some of which have impacted certain raw materials we use. We have made operational changes in an effort to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on our products, but our efforts may not be successful.\nIn addition, we are subject to export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations that restrict the delivery of some of our products and services to certain end users, countries and nationals of certain countries. In certain circumstances, these restrictions may prohibit the transfer of certain of our products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances they may require us to obtain a license from the U.S. government before delivering the controlled item or service. We must also comply with export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations imposed by other countries. Although we maintain an export and trade control compliance program, it may be ineffective or circumvented, exposing us to legal liabilities. Compliance with these laws could significantly limit our sales in the future. Changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade controls could reduce the competitiveness of our products and cause our sales to drop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to the tariffs mentioned above, over the last several years, the U.S. government has significantly expanded export controls on certain technologies and commodities to certain markets, particularly with respect to semiconductor and other high technology exports to China. For example, effective June 29, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed new export controls on the transfer of many U.S. products and technologies, including many commercial-grade electronics, to \u201cmilitary end users\u201d in China, a term which may include many Chinese commercial companies that sell products to or do business with the\nmilitary. Likewise, beginning in May 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed significant restrictions on the transfer of any products from the United States, as well as many products produced overseas that incorporate U.S. content or rely on U.S. software or technology, to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and several of its overseas affiliates, including HiSilicon, and took similar action against Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation in December 2020. The U.S. Department of Commerce continues to impose similar export-related restrictions against other Chinese companies for their support of the military, for business activities, including supply chain activities, related to the Xinjiang region of China, and for other actions found to be contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy. The U.S. government also continuously assesses which \u201cemerging and foundational technologies\u201d warrant new or additional controls, which could subject additional U.S.-origin products and services to more stringent export restrictions. It is possible that these modified regulations, and any future regulations, could reduce demand for our products. As a result of these restrictive measures, certain of our customers have made efforts to source products domestically in order to mitigate perceived risks to their supply chain. If these efforts are successful, are widespread amongst our customers and expand to our products and solutions broadly, overall global demand for our customers\u2019 products or for other products produced or manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology may be reduced, in turn reducing demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such risks may be especially exacerbated as they relate to China, a market that is important to our business, representing approximately 16% of our sales in 2021.\nA significant portion of our sales is concentrated on a limited number of key customers, and our net sales and profitability may materially decline if we were to lose one or more of these customers.\nSales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections and profitability. Our top ten customers accounted for 43%, 46% and 43% of our net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our customers could stop using our products in their manufacturing processes with limited advance notice to us, and we would have limited or no contractual recourse. The cancellation, reduction or deferral of purchases of our products by any one of these customers could significantly reduce our revenues in any particular quarter. If we were to lose any of our significant customers, if our products are not specified for our significant customers\u2019 products or if we suffer a material reduction in their purchase orders, our revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Due to the long design and development cycle and lengthy customer product qualification periods required for most of our products, we may be unable to replace these customers quickly, if at all.\nFurthermore, the semiconductor industry has been undergoing, and is expected to continue to undergo, consolidation. If any of our customers merge or are acquired, we may experience lower overall sales from the merged or combined companies. In addition, our principal customers also hold considerable purchasing power and may be able to negotiate sales terms that result in decreased pricing, increased costs, and/or lower margins for us, and limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others.\nIf we are unable to anticipate and respond to rapid technological change and customer requirements by continuing to innovate and introduce new and enhanced products and solutions, our business could be seriously harmed.\nThe semiconductor industry is subject to rapid technological change, changing customer requirements and frequent new product introductions. In our industry, the first company to introduce an innovative product that addresses an identified market need will often have a significant advantage over competing products. For this reason, we make significant expenditures to research, develop, engineer and market new products and make significant capital investments in technology and manufacturing capacity in anticipation of future business and without any purchase commitment from our customers. We incurred $167.6 million, $136.1 million and $121.1 million for engineering, research and development expense in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, to support new product and technology development. Following development, it may take several years for sales of a new product to reach a substantial level, if ever. If a product concept does not progress beyond the development stage or only achieves limited acceptance in the marketplace, we may not receive a direct return on our expenditures, we may lose market share and our revenue and our profitability may decline. For example, in the past, we incurred significant impairment charges for capital expenditures related to developing the capability to manufacture shippers and FOUPs for 450 mm wafers, which major semiconductor manufacturers announced that they would not initiate manufacturing for in the foreseeable future.\nWe believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to develop mission-critical solutions to maximize our customers\u2019 manufacturing yields and enable higher performance semiconductor devices. A failure to successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes by developing, marketing and manufacturing new products or enhancements to our existing products could harm our business prospects and significantly reduce our sales. For example, as 3D NAND technology advances to higher densities, the conventional process used to etch critical features no longer works. Recognizing the need for a new chemistry, we developed a series of prototype formulations for highly selective nitride etch and developed a specialized liquid filter that removes contaminants while simultaneously maintaining the critical components that make the chemistry function. While we have achieved process-of-record for these specific etch processes with certain customers and we are preparing for rapid, high-volume ramp, we may not generate significant revenue from these solutions. We cannot assure you\nthat the new products and technology we choose to develop and market will be successful. In addition, if new products have reliability or quality problems, we may experience reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance and payment, additional service and warranty expense and damage to our reputation.\nCompetition from new or existing companies could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. We face many competitors, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have better-established customer relationships than we do, which may enable them to have their products specified for use more frequently and more quickly by these customers. We also face competition from smaller, regional companies that focus on serving customers in their regions. Further, customers continually evaluate the benefits of internal manufacturing versus outsourcing, and a customer\u2019s decision to internally manufacture products that we provide may negatively impact us. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and a loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, we expect that existing and new competitors will improve their products and introduce new products with enhanced performance characteristics. The introduction of new products or more efficient production of existing products by competitors could diminish our market share and increase pricing pressure on our products.\nWe may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures or divest businesses, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe intend to continue to engage in business combinations, acquisitions, joint ventures, investments or other types of collaborations to address gaps in our product offerings, adjust our business and product portfolio to meet our ongoing strategic objectives, diversify into complementary markets, increase our scale or accomplish other strategic objectives. These transactions involve numerous risks to our business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:\n\u2022experiencing difficulty in identifying suitable acquisition candidates and completing transactions at appropriate valuations, in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all, due to substantial competition for acquisition targets;\n\u2022inability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our business operations;\n\u2022failure to realize the anticipated synergies or other benefits of any such transaction;\n\u2022entering into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;\n\u2022finding acquirors and obtaining adequate value for businesses that no longer meet our objectives;\n\u2022inability to complete proposed transactions due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals;\n\u2022requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of our existing business or the acquired business;\n\u2022undertaking multiple transactions at the same time in order to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that do arise, which could strain our ability to effectively execute and integrate such transactions;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day business due to dedication of significant management resources to such transactions;\n\u2022employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process that may also disrupt our business;\n\u2022the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;\n\u2022challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people, potentially located in regions where we have not historically conducted or operated our business;\n\u2022dependence on unfamiliar or less secure supply chains and inefficient scale of the acquired entity;\n\u2022increasing costs of performing due diligence to meet the expectations of investors and government regulators;\n\u2022despite our due diligence, we could assume unknown, underestimated or contingent liabilities, such as potential environmental, health and safety liabilities, any of which could lead to costly litigation or mitigation actions;\n\u2022an acquired technology or product may have inadequate or invalid intellectual property protection or may be subject to claims of infringement by a third party, which may result in claims for damages and lower than anticipated revenue;\n\u2022we could experience negative effects on our reported results of operations from dilutive results from operations and/or from future potential impairment of acquired assets, including goodwill, related to acquisitions;\n\u2022an acquired company may have inadequate or ineffective internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy, environmental, health and safety, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, human resource or other policies or practices, which may require unexpected or additional integration, mitigation and remediation costs;\n\u2022reductions in cash or increases in debt to finance transactions, which reduce the cash flow available for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends; and\n\u2022difficulties in retaining key employees or customers of an acquired business.\nManufacturing interruptions or delays, or other disruptions to our operations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing processes are complex and require the use of expensive and technologically sophisticated equipment and materials. These processes are frequently modified to improve manufacturing yields, process stability and product quality. We have, on occasion, experienced manufacturing difficulties, such as critical equipment breakdowns or the introduction of impurities in the manufacturing process. Any future difficulties could cause lower yields, make our products unmarketable and/or delay deliveries to customers. In addition, any modification to the manufacturing process of a product could require that the product be re-qualified by customers, which can increase our costs and delay our ability to sell this product to our customers. These and other manufacturing difficulties may result in the loss of sales and exposure to warranty and product liability claims.\nSome of our products are manufactured at only one or two facilities in different countries, many of which are subject to severe weather events and natural catastrophes, such as typhoons in Taiwan, Malaysia and China, earthquakes in Japan and Taiwan, hurricanes in east Texas and Florida, severe winter weather in Texas, wildfires in California and Colorado and flooding in Arkansas. Our suppliers and customers face similar dangers. Although we have continuity plans designed to mitigate the impact of natural disasters on our operations, those plans may be insufficient, and any catastrophe may disrupt our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers, resulting in an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. A disruption at our manufacturing facilities could impact sales of the products manufactured at those facilities until another facility could commence or expand production of those products, and disruptions at our other facilities may similarly adversely affect our operations. In addition to natural disasters, disruptions may be caused by other factors, including civil unrest, outbreaks of disease, terrorist actions or other events outside our control. We have moved, and we may again move, the manufacture of certain products from one plant to another. If we fail to transfer and re-establish the manufacturing processes in the destination plant efficiently and effectively, we may not be able to meet customer demand, we may lose credibility with our customers and our business may be harmed. Even if we successfully move our manufacturing processes, we may not achieve the anticipated levels of cost savings or efficiencies, if any.\nOur operations use hazardous materials that expose us to various risks, including potential liability for personal injury and potential remediation obligations.\nOur operations involve, and we are exposed to the risks associated with, the use and manufacture of hazardous materials. In particular, we manufacture specialty chemicals, which is an inherently hazardous process that may result in accidents, and store and transport hazardous raw materials, products and waste in, to and from various facilities. Potential risks that may disrupt our operations or expose us to significant losses and liabilities include explosions and fires, chemical spills and other discharges, releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, and pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures. These and other hazards may result in liability for personal injury, death, damage to property and contamination of the environment; suspension of operations; the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions; cleanup costs; claims by governmental entities or third parties; reputational harm; increases in our insurance costs; and other adverse impacts on our results of operations. Moreover, a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of the customer. For example, while we believe that our SDS and VAC delivery systems are safe to transport, store and deliver toxic gases, any leakage could cause serious damage, including injury or death, to any person exposed to those toxic gases, potentially creating significant product liability exposure for us. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to satisfy any such liabilities, and our financial results or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nLoss of any of our key personnel could harm our business, and our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully.\nMany of our key personnel have significant experience in the semiconductor industry and deep technical expertise. The loss of the services of any of our key employees or an inability to attract, train and retain qualified and skilled employees, particularly research and development and engineering personnel, could inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business. As the semiconductor industry has grown in recent years, competition for qualified talent, particularly those with significant industry experience, has intensified. During 2021 we experienced, and may in the future continue to experience, an increasingly competitive and constrained labor market, which may limit our ability to add headcount required to meet our customers\u2019 demand, decrease our productivity due to an influx of inexperienced workers and cause our labor costs to increase and our\nprofitability to decline. As a result, the difficulty and costs associated with attracting and retaining employees has risen and may continue to rise.\nIf we fail to obtain, protect and enforce intellectual property rights, our business and prospects could be harmed.\nOur future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights. We rely on patent, trade secret and trademark laws to protect many of our major product platforms. Although we often file applications for additional patents, our pending applications may not be approved. Moreover, any patents that we own or obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantage, and these patents may expire or be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised by third parties. We may not develop additional proprietary technology. In addition, any failure to obtain intellectual property protection in the international jurisdictions we serve could expose us to increased competition, which could limit our growth and future revenue. Although we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain third parties to protect our proprietary information and technology, these agreements may be inadequate to protect our interests, and the remedies available to us for any breach may not adequately mitigate any breach. Furthermore, third parties may be able to replicate or obtain our confidential and proprietary information and technology through lawful means, and they may also be able to design around our patents. Additionally, we may lose trade secret protection as a result of the actions or omissions of us, our employees or third parties. Any weakness in our ability to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThird parties may misappropriate our intellectual property rights, and disputes regarding intellectual property rights may arise. We may bring litigation in order to enforce our patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects regardless of whether our efforts are successful. For example, from 2015 until 2020, we were party to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights against Gudeng Precision Industrial Co., Ltd. for their patent infringement. We settled this dispute in 2020 by licensing certain of our intellectual property rights to Gudeng. In 2021, Gudeng filed a patent lawsuit against us and the lawsuit is pending. We continue to vigorously defend our patents and rights, which will cause us to incur costs. We may initiate other costly litigation against our competitors or other third parties in order to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot predict how any existing or future litigation will be resolved or what impact it may have on us.\nOur commercial success also depends, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating any patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. If we infringe or misappropriate a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights, we could be required to pay damages, alter our products or processes, obtain a license to continue use of a proprietary right or cease utilizing such proprietary rights, including making or selling products utilizing such proprietary rights. If we are required to obtain a license, we may be unable to do so on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and new laws and regulations regarding data privacy may increase our costs.\nWe collect and store sensitive data, including our financial information, intellectual property, confidential information, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our employees and others, as well as similar information of our customers, suppliers and business partners. We maintain this information in our data centers, on our networks and on information technology, or IT, systems owned and maintained by third parties. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. All IT systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure. Data breaches, including those sponsored by state actors, have become increasingly common in recent years. For example, during 2020 the United States government was hacked via third-party software applications by hackers suspected of being sponsored by a foreign intelligence agency. While we and our third-party providers have implemented network security procedures, virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, access control, emergency recovery processes and internal control measures, we and they have experienced, and expect to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from employee error or misuse, to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. Despite the precautions undertaken by us and our third-party providers, IT system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could cause disruption in our operations, issues with customer communication and order management, the unauthorized or unintentional disclosure of sensitive information, disruptions in our transaction processing or undermine the integrity of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, which could affect our reputation, result in significant liabilities and expenses, adversely affect our ability to report our financial results in a timely manner and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These risks may be further amplified by the increased reliance on remote access to IT systems by us and our customers, suppliers and other third parties with which we do business as a result of employees working remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMoreover, new laws and regulations, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act and China\u2019s Personal Information Protection Law, add to the complexity of our compliance obligations, which increases our compliance costs. Although we have established internal controls and procedures intended to achieve compliance with such laws and regulations, a failure to fully comply could result in significant penalties.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nThere are inherent climate-related risks wherever our business is conducted. Changes in market dynamics, stakeholder expectations, local, national and international climate change policies, and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the United States and abroad, all have the potential to disrupt our business and operations. Such events could result in a significant increase in our costs and expenses and harm our future revenue, cash flows and financial performance. Global climate change is resulting in, and may continue to result, in certain natural disasters and adverse weather events, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise and flooding, occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, which could cause business disruptions and impact employees\u2019 abilities to commute or to work from home effectively. Government failure to address climate change in line with the Paris Agreement could result in greater exposure to economic and other risks from climate change and impact our ability to achieve climate goals.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant liabilities and expenses.\nFailure to comply with the wide variety of federal, state, local and non-U.S. regulatory requirements relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and human exposure to, hazardous chemicals could result in future liabilities or the suspension of production or shipment. These requirements have become stricter over time. These laws and regulations, among others, increase the complexity and costs of transporting our products from the country in which they are manufactured to our customers. Further changes to these and similar regulations could restrict our ability to expand, build or acquire new facilities, require us to acquire costly control equipment, cause us to incur expenses associated with remediation of contamination, cause us to modify our manufacturing or shipping processes or otherwise increase our cost of doing business and have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the potential adoption of new laws, rules or regulations related to climate change poses risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our businesses. For example, new or modified regulations could require us to make substantial expenditures to enhance our environmental compliance efforts.\nWe are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment.\nWe are subject to risks related to new, different, inconsistent, or even conflicting laws, rules, and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries where we operate; disagreements or disputes related to international trade; and the interpretation and application of laws, rules, and regulations. As a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to health and safety, export controls, financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials or customers, conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation, employment practices, immigration or travel regulations and antitrust regulations, among others. Each of these laws, rules and regulations imposes costs on our business, including financial costs and potential diversion of our management\u2019s attention, and may present risks to our business, including potential fines, restrictions on our actions and reputational damage if we do not fully comply. The volume of changes to such laws, rules and regulations may increase in the United States over the next several quarters as the Biden administration continues to implement its policies.\nTo maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest in appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards. Changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased administrative expenses and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with laws and regulations, our reputation, business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be adversely affected, we may be disqualified or barred from participating in certain activities and we may be forced to modify our operations to achieve full compliance.\nChanges in taxation or adverse tax rulings could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe operate in many foreign countries and are subject to taxation at various rates and audit by multiple taxing authorities. Our results of operations could be affected by tax audits, changes in tax rates, changes in laws and regulations governing the calculation, location and taxation of earned profit, changes in laws and regulations affecting our ability to realize deferred tax\nassets on our balance sheet and changes in laws and regulations relating to the repatriation of cash into the United States. Each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year in each tax jurisdiction. If our performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability would also likely change, perhaps materially.\nWe have undertaken and expect to continue to undertake a number of complex internal reorganizations of our foreign subsidiaries in order to rationalize and streamline our foreign operations, focus our management efforts on certain local opportunities and take advantage of favorable business conditions in certain localities. These or any future reorganizations could result in adverse tax consequences in one or more jurisdictions, which could adversely impact our profitability from foreign operations and result in a material reduction in our results of operations.\nVarious other jurisdictions, including members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are considering changes to their tax laws, including provisions intended to address base erosion and profit shifting by taxpayers. Any tax reform adopted in these or other countries may exacerbate the risks described above.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and may in the future incur substantially more debt, each of which could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future and react to changes in our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate principal amount of $945.0 million of indebtedness outstanding, including our 4.375% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2028 and our 3.625% senior unsecured notes due May 1, 2029, or collectively the Notes, and our senior secured term loan facility due 2025, or the Term Loan Facility. In addition, we have approximately $400 million of unutilized capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility due 2026, or the Revolving Facility. We refer to the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility as the Credit Facilities, and the credit agreement that governs the Credit Facilities as the Credit Agreement.\nFurther, we may incur significant additional secured and unsecured indebtedness in the future. For example, in connection with our proposed merger with CMC, we have entered into an amended and restated commitment letter with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and certain other financial institutions providing for a senior secured first lien term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $4 billion and a senior unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $895 million. Commitments under the bridge facility will be reduced by, among other things, the aggregate gross cash proceeds in excess of $300 million resulting from any issuance or sale by Entegris of certain securities, including senior unsecured notes or other debt securities or other indebtedness for borrowed money, equity securities and equity-linked securities.\nAlthough the indentures governing the Notes, or the Indentures, and the Credit Agreement restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, the restrictions have a number of significant qualifications and exceptions. For example, the Credit Agreement provides that we can request additional loans and commitments up to the greater of $400 million or 100% of our EBITDA, as well as additional amounts if our secured net leverage ratio is less than a specified ratio. Further, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring monetary obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If we add new indebtedness and other monetary obligations to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would intensify.\nOur debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022exposing us to increased interest expense for borrowings with variable interest rates, including borrowings under the Credit Facilities; and\n\u2022placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt having more favorable terms.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions, which may not be successful, to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe may be unable to maintain sufficient cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets, which are subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions, as well as many financial, business, legislative, political, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems, be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets\nor operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nAny refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. We may not be able to implement any refinancing on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, a refinancing may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds of such dispositions, and we may be unable to consummate any dispositions or generate proceeds sufficient to meet our debt service obligations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, holders of the Notes and lenders under the Credit Facilities could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Revolving Facility could terminate their commitments to advance further loans, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement may restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or raise additional funds.\nThe Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions that may limit our ability to take actions that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022make investments, loans, advances and acquisitions;\n\u2022sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022alter the businesses we conduct; and\n\u2022merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets or incur a change of control in our capital stock ownership.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants may, depending on the amount of revolving borrowings, unreimbursed letter of credit drawings and undrawn letters of credit, require us to maintain a secured net leverage ratio, which we may be unable to meet. Also, the Indentures contain limited covenants, such as a covenant restricting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur certain debt secured by liens. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in the acceleration of some or all of our indebtedness, which could lead to bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency.\nRisks Related to Owning our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been and may remain volatile.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile. In 2021, the closing price of our stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or Nasdaq, ranged from a low of $93.99 to a high of $154.75, and, as in past years, the price of our common stock may show even greater volatility in the future. The trading price of our common stock is subject to significant volatility in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control or may be unrelated to our operating results, including the following:\n\u2022the significant increase in volatility in the stock market in general as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022any changes to our financial guidance, as well as potential decreased confidence in any guidance we do provide;\n\u2022changes in global economic conditions, including those resulting from trade tensions or the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts, which may vary significantly from our actual results;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022press releases or announcements by, or changes in market values of, comparable companies;\n\u2022high volatility in price and volume in the markets for high-technology stocks;\n\u2022the public perception of equity values of publicly traded companies;\n\u2022fluctuations in our results of operations; and\n\u2022the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC.\nFluctuations in our results of operations could cause our stock price to decline significantly. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as indicators of our future performance. Future decreases in our stock price may adversely impact our ability to raise sufficient additional capital in the future, if needed.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or that we will recommence the repurchase of our shares in any particular amounts or at all.\nIn connection with our proposed acquisition of CMC, we have suspended our previously announced share repurchase program. Future payments of quarterly dividends and any future repurchases of shares of our common stock are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that they are in the best interest of our stockholders and comply with all laws and applicable agreements. Future dividends and any future share repurchases may be affected by, among other factors, potential capital requirements for acquisitions and the funding of our research and development activities; legal risks; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; availability of domestic cash flow; and changes to our business model. The amounts of our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we may decide at any time to reduce, suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends or the repurchase of shares. A reduction, suspension or discontinuation of our dividend payments or the cessation of our share repurchase program could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and may harm our reputation.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us, which could decrease the value of our shares.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include limitations on actions by written consent of our stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation makes us subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits publicly held Delaware corporations from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This provision could discourage parties from bidding for our shares of common stock and could, as a result, reduce the likelihood of an increase in the price of our common stock that would otherwise occur if a bidder sought to buy our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue, without further stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix and designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and liquidation preferences. The holders of any shares of preferred stock could have preferences over the holders of our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Any issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control. Any issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock and could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Pending Merger with CMC Materials, Inc.\nFailure to complete our pending merger with CMC Materials, Inc. could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could negatively impact our stock price.\nOn December 14, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with merger sub and CMC, pursuant to which merger sub will merge with and into CMC, with CMC surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entegris. We will incur significant transaction costs relating to the merger, including legal, accounting, financial advisory, regulatory and other expenses. In general, these expenses are payable by us whether or not the merger is completed. The payment of such transaction costs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we could be subject to litigation in the event the merger is not consummated, which could subject us to significant liability for damages and result in the incurrence of substantial legal fees. The current market price of our stock may reflect an assumption that the pending merger will occur and failure to complete the merger could result in a decline in our stock price.\nThe merger may not be completed and the merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms.\nThe merger is subject to a number of conditions that must be satisfied, including the approval by CMC stockholders of the merger agreement proposal, or waived (to the extent permissible), in each case before the completion of the merger. These conditions to the completion of the merger, some of which are beyond our control and that of CMC, may not be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may be delayed or not completed.\nAdditionally, either we or CMC may terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including, among other reasons, if the merger is not completed by December 14, 2022 (which date may be extended to March 14, 2023, under certain circumstances. In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, CMC may be required to pay us a termination fee of $187 million, including certain circumstances in which the CMC board of directors effects an adverse recommendation change or CMC enters into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal following the termination of the merger agreement.\nThe announcement and pendency of the merger agreement and any subsequent termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact us or CMC.\nWhether or not the merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in our businesses. If the merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of a failure to obtain the required CMC stockholder vote or the failure to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected. We may be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price;\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from our suppliers and customers;\n\u2022our current and prospective employees and those of CMC may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company, which might adversely affect our or CMC\u2019s abilities to retain key managers and other employees;\n\u2022the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of each company\u2019s business prior to completion of the merger and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of the other company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), which may prevent us or CMC from taking certain other specified actions during the pendency of the merger; and\n\u2022matters relating to the merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and CMC management, which could otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations or to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us or CMC, as applicable, as an independent company.\nThe market price for shares of our common stock following the completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from, or in addition to, those that historically have affected or currently affect the market price of shares of our common stock.\nUpon consummation of the merger, our stockholders and CMC stockholders will both hold shares of common stock in Entegris. Our businesses differ from those of CMC, and CMC\u2019s businesses differ from those of our business, and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently or historically affecting our results of operations and those currently or historically affecting the results of operations of CMC. The results of operations of the combined company may also be affected by factors different from those that currently affect or have historically affected either us or CMC.\nUntil the completion of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, we and CMC are each prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or CMC and our or their respective shareholders.\nFrom and after the date of the merger agreement and before completion of the merger, the merger agreement restricts us and CMC from taking specified actions without the consent of the other party (with CMC being restricted from taking a broader set of specified actions than us) and requires that the business of each company and its respective subsidiaries be conducted in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. These restrictions may prevent us or CMC from making appropriate changes to our or their respective businesses or organizational structures or from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise before the completion of the merger, and could have the effect of delaying or preventing other strategic transactions. Adverse effects arising from the pendency of the merger could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.\nFailure to attract, motivate and retain executives and other key employees could diminish the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe success of the merger will depend in part on the retention of personnel critical to the business and operations of the combined company due to, for example, their technical skills or management expertise. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense.\nOur current and prospective employees and those of CMC may experience uncertainty about their future role with us and the combined company until strategies with regard to these employees are announced or executed, which may impair our and\nCMC\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key management, sales, marketing, technical and other personnel before and following the merger. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If we or CMC are unable to retain personnel, including our and CMC\u2019s key management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies, we and the combined company could face disruptions in our operations, loss of existing customers or loss of sales to existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how, and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs. In addition, the loss of key personnel could diminish the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nIf our key employees or CMC\u2019s key employees depart, the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined company\u2019s business following the merger may be harmed. Furthermore, the combined company may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to our business or CMC\u2019s business, and the combined company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger may be adversely affected. In addition, there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with activities of labor unions or integrating employees into the combined company. No assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain our key employees and those of CMC to the same extent that the separate companies have been able to attract or retain their respective employees in the past.\nThe failure to successfully combine our and CMC\u2019s businesses may adversely affect our future results.\nThe success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from integrating CMC into the Company. To realize these anticipated benefits, our business and CMC must be successfully combined. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nWe may not be able to retain customers or suppliers, or customers or suppliers may seek to modify contractual obligations with us, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations. Third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with us or CMC.\nAs a result of the merger, we may experience impacts on relationships with customers or suppliers that may harm our business and results of operations. Certain customers or suppliers may seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations following the merger whether or not contractual rights are triggered as a result of the merger. There can be no guarantee that customers or suppliers will remain with or continue to have a relationship with us or do so on the same or similar contractual terms following the merger. If any customers or suppliers seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations or discontinue the relationship with us, then our business and results of operations may be harmed. If certain of our suppliers were to seek to terminate or modify an arrangement with us, then we may be unable to procure necessary supplies from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe and CMC also have contracts with vendors, landlords, licensors and other business partners which may require us or CMC, as applicable, to obtain consent from these other parties in connection with the merger. If these consents cannot be obtained, we may suffer a loss of potential future revenue, incur costs, and lose rights that may be material to its business. In addition, third parties with whom we or CMC currently have relationships may terminate or otherwise reduce the scope of their relationship with either party in anticipation of the merger. Any such disruptions could limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The adverse effect of any such disruptions could also be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the merger or by a termination of the merger agreement.\nThe combined company\u2019s debt may limit our financial flexibility following the merger.\nWe expect to incur a substantial amount of debt in connection with the merger and have entered into an amended and restated commitment letter with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and certain other financial institutions providing for a senior secured first lien term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $4 billion and a senior unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $895 million. We expect to use a portion of the proceeds from such facilities to repay and terminate both our and CMC\u2019s existing credit facilities (or, amend or otherwise refinance, our Revolving Facility) substantially concurrently with the completion of the merger. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2021, the combined company would have had approximately $5.6 billion of total debt, after giving pro forma effect to the merger, the refinancing of our and CMC\u2019s existing credit facilities and certain other adjustments.\nFollowing the merger, the combined company\u2019s substantial indebtedness could have adverse effects on the combined company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\u2022increasing its vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting its ability to compete and its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry;\n\u2022limiting its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders;\n\u2022limiting its ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022increasing its interest expense and requiring it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and other purposes.\nThe combined company\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, and to pay interest on or to refinance its indebtedness following the merger will depend on, among other factors, the combined company\u2019s respective financial positions and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond its control. Our combined business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service the combined company\u2019s debt and make necessary capital expenditures and meet its other liquidity needs. If the combined company is unable to generate such cash flow, it may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital or debt refinancing on terms that may be onerous. The combined company may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on its debt obligations which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate the combined company\u2019s repayment obligations under all of its outstanding debt which could have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, the level and quality of the combined company\u2019s earnings, operations, business and management, among other things, will impact the determination of the combined company\u2019s credit ratings. A decrease in the ratings assigned to the combined company by the ratings agencies may negatively impact the combined company\u2019s access to the debt capital markets and increase the combined company\u2019s cost of borrowing. There can be no assurance that the combined company will be able to obtain any future required financing on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that the combined company will be able to maintain the current credit worthiness or prospective credit rating of the Company. Any actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in such credit rating may have a negative impact on the liquidity, capital position or access to capital markets of the combined company.\nThe covenants contained in the agreements governing the combined company\u2019s indebtedness following the merger will impose restrictions on the combined company and certain of its subsidiaries that may affect their ability to operate their businesses.\nThe agreements that will govern the indebtedness of the combined company following the merger, including the indebtedness to be incurred pursuant to the commitment letter (or any indebtedness that may refinance or replace the bridge facility as set forth in the commitment letter) will contain various affirmative and negative covenants. Such covenants may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict the ability of the combined company and certain of its subsidiaries after the merger to, among other things, incur liens, incur debt, engage in mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, transfer assets outside the ordinary course of business, make loans or other investments, pay dividends, repurchase equity interests, make other payments with respect to equity interests, repay or repurchase subordinated debt and engage in affiliate transactions. In addition, such agreements may also contain financial covenants that would require the combined company to maintain certain financial ratios under certain circumstances. The ability of the combined company and its subsidiaries to comply with these provisions after the merger may be affected by events beyond their control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate the combined company\u2019s repayment obligations under all of its outstanding debt which could have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 88439, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "ENTG"}
