{"cik": "912513", "company": "CYTEC INDUSTRIES INC/DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors described below should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report, including, but not limited to, the discussion under \u201cComments on Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in the section preceding Part I, and discussions of the business included in Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d and Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis.\u201d\n\u2022\nOur successful and timely completion of major capital projects involves a number of risks.\nWe have limited capacity available for future growth in several important product lines. We have ongoing capital projects to complete and/or qualify in an effort to expand capacity for future growth. A protracted late start or failure to successfully startup any of these expansion projects whether due to construction delays, permitting issues or otherwise, could lead to reduced revenue and growth opportunities, potential contractual penalties for failures to meet customer requirements and/or potential loss of market share. In addition, any unanticipated problems, expenses or additional capital required to complete any of these projects or reduction in demand for products produced at these sites could lead to reduced profitability or returns to the applicable business segment and overall company.\n\u2022\nUses of Cash\nWe have generated a significant amount of cash in recent years. Our uses of cash are as follows: investment in the typical maintenance of business capital spending projects; expansion/cost reduction capital in our growth product lines and fast payback/margin improvement capital in our cash product lines; bolt-on acquisitions for our growth product lines; return of excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends; and debt repurchases, if available at a reasonable price. The use of cash for capacity expansions or bolt-on acquisitions requires the use of significant estimates by management on future revenues and costs. If the actual results for revenues are materially less or costs are materially higher than the estimates made by management, it would reduce the returns on the use of the cash employed and future cash generation.\n\u2022\nRestructuring charges, goodwill impairment, acquisition intangible impairment, or other asset impairment charges may affect our results of operations in the future.\nManagement regularly reviews the cost effectiveness of its plant sites and/or assets at such sites. Long-lived assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We may find it necessary to record disposition, restructuring, or asset impairment charges in connection with such reviews. For example, we recorded restructuring charges of approximately $1.0 in 2014, $6.9 in 2013, and $21.2 in 2012, principally related to employee severance and asset impairments. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they are recorded.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis each October 1st and more often if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to an amount below its carrying value. We also test for other possible acquisition intangible impairments if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount of such intangible asset may not be recoverable. Any resulting impairment loss would be a non-cash charge and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in any future period in which we record a charge. In total, we had goodwill of $508.8 and acquisition intangibles with a net carrying value of $141.6 at December 31, 2014. See \u201cSignificant Accounting Estimates / Critical Accounting Policies\u201d under Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\u201d for further discussion on our goodwill impairment testing.\n\u2022\nLoss of certain significant customers, such as Boeing and its subcontractors, or reductions of sales from certain programs from customers, such as the Boeing 787 program or Lockheed Martin Joint Strike Fighter, may have an adverse effect on results of the affected segment and loss of several significant customers may have an adverse effect on our consolidated results.\nApproximately 21%, 20%, and 19% of our 2014, 2013 and 2012 net sales, respectively, were to Boeing and its subcontractors, of which 20%, 20%, and 18% related to our Aerospace Materials segment, and 1%, 0%, and 1% related to our Industrial Materials segment. The loss of Boeing as a customer, or a reduction in volumes sold to them, whether it is caused by a work stoppage or other disruption, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or the disruption ends. In addition, where we are the sole supplier for a significant customer or market, disruptions, or delays in our ability to supply may result in the customer seeking or qualifying alternative suppliers. A\n- 11-\nsummary of various long-term customer supply agreements is disclosed under \u201cCommitments\u201d in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u2022\nSome of the markets in which we operate have experienced business cycles and downturns and deterioration in any such cyclical markets could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.\nReductions in aerospace or defense spending could result in a decline in our net sales, which could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition. A number of our customers operate in cyclical industries such as the automotive, construction, and mining industries. This in turn, causes demand for our products in these markets to also be cyclical.\n\u2022\nInterruptions in our supply chain from key suppliers or increases in the cost of raw materials could negatively affect our profitability.\nKey raw materials for the Aerospace Materials and Industrial Materials segments are carbon fiber and various resins. Key raw materials for the In Process Separation and Additive Technologies segments are propylene derivatives such as acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, nonylphenol, maleic anhydride and natural gas for energy. These are typically available although we have experienced tight markets for certain raw materials from time to time. Because of the time and expense to qualify materials for aerospace applications, a supply shortage in a low volume raw material also could cause production disruptions. Accordingly, there are risks of supply disruptions.\nOil and natural gas are important indirect raw materials for many of our products. The prices of both of these commodities have been volatile over time. Sudden price swings can adversely affect our ability to recover increased costs from our customers or demand for our products. Prices for these commodities may vary widely between geographic regions and, as a result of this, many of our products could compete with similar products made with less expensive raw materials available elsewhere and we may not be able to recover any or all of these increased costs.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for carbon fibers that are used in many of our advanced composite products. As we manufacture some of our own standard modulus carbon fibers, the risk of future carbon fiber supply limitations is somewhat reduced.\nChanges to raw material costs year on year are an important factor in profitability. Raw material prices can increase or decrease based on supply and demand and other market forces. We have, from time to time, experienced difficulty procuring several key raw materials, such as but not limited to, carbon fiber and certain base resins due to general market conditions or conditions unique to a significant supplier. We may experience supply disruptions of these and other materials in the future. Such conditions, if protracted, could result in our inability to manufacture our products, resulting in lower than anticipated revenues. If we are unable to raise our selling prices to recover the increased costs of raw materials driven by higher energy costs or other factors, our profit margins will be adversely affected. In other cases, we may have to reduce the selling prices of our products due to competitive pressures and may not be able to retain the additional profitability from the reduced raw material costs.\n\u2022\nWe face active competition from other companies, which could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.\nWe actively compete with companies producing the same or similar products and, in some instances, with companies producing different products designed for the same uses. We encounter competition in price, delivery, service, performance, product innovation, product recognition and quality, depending on the product involved. For some of our products, our competitors are larger, have greater financial resources, or are more vertically integrated. As a result, these competitors may be able to offer better supply security to end customers and better able to withstand a change in conditions within the industries in which we operate, changes in the prices of raw materials without increasing their prices, or a change in the economy as a whole. To compete effectively over the long term, we believe we may need to secure alternate access to cost competitive intermediate modulus carbon fibers for primary structure aerospace applications and large tow carbon fibers for automotive and industrial applications.\nOur competitors can be expected to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products, which could cause a decline in market acceptance of our products. Current and future consolidation among our competitors and customers may also cause a loss of market share as well as put downward pressure on pricing. Our competitors could cause a reduction in the prices for some of our products as a result of intensified price competition. Competitive pressures can also result in the loss of major customers.\n\u2022\nWe face numerous risks relating to our international operations that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe operate on a global basis, with manufacturing and research facilities located in 11 countries. Through our sales forces, third-party distributors and agents, we market our products internationally.\n- 12-\nInternational operations are subject to various risks which may or may not be present in U.S. operations. These risks include political instability, the possibility of expropriation, restrictions on royalties, dividends and remittances, exchange rate fluctuations, requirements for governmental approvals for new ventures and local participation in operations such as local equity ownership and workers\u2019 councils. Since we conduct business through subsidiaries in many different countries, fluctuations in exchange rates could have a major impact on our reported revenues, which are reported in U.S. dollars. In 2014, approximately 55% of our consolidated net sales occurred outside of the U.S., a significant portion of which are denominated in foreign currencies. However, we have material operations outside the U.S., which tend to offset some of the impact on earnings. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates could cause favorable or unfavorable fluctuations in our reported results of operations. Cross border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to exchange effects. Such fluctuations between the various currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause currency transaction gains and losses, which may be material. While we may periodically enter into currency forward contracts to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity, it is not always cost effective to hedge all foreign currency exposures in a manner that would completely eliminate the effects of changes in exchange rates on our results of operations or cash flows. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in favorable or unfavorable translation effects as the results of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. While we do not currently believe that we are likely to suffer a material adverse effect on our results of operations in connection with our existing international operations, any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products, affecting the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise having an adverse effect on our operating performance. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on geographical information.\n\u2022\nPolitical and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our customers or suppliers may adversely impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries or regions in which we or our customers or suppliers operate including: civil unrest, acts of terrorism, sabotage, epidemics, force majeure, war or other armed conflict and related government actions including: sanctions/embargoes, the deprivation of contract rights, the inability to obtain or retain licenses required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or raw materials; the expropriation or nationalization of our assets, and restrictions on travel, payments or the movement of funds. In particular, if additional restrictions on trade with Russia were adopted by the European Union or the United States, and were applicable to our products, we could lose sales and experience lower growth rates in the future.\n\u2022\nOur facilities are subject to operating risks that may adversely affect our operations.\nOur revenues are largely dependent on the continued operation of our various facilities. There are many risks involved in operating our facilities, including the breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment, operating errors, natural disasters, the need to comply with directives of, and maintain all necessary permits from, government agencies, and potential terrorist attack. Our operations can be adversely affected by raw material shortages, labor force shortages or work stoppages and events impeding or increasing the cost of transporting our raw materials and finished products. The occurrence of material operational problems, including but not limited to the above events, may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility. With respect to certain facilities, such events could have a material effect on our company as a whole.\nOur operations are also subject to various hazards incident to the production of industrial chemicals. These include the use, handling, processing, storage, and transportation of certain hazardous materials. Under certain circumstances, these hazards could cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, environmental damage and suspension of operations. Claims arising from any future catastrophic occurrence at one of our locations may result in Cytec being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to significant environmental and product regulatory expenses and risks.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations which impose stringent requirements for the control and abatement of pollutants and contaminants and the manufacture, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, pollutants and contaminants.\nIn particular, under various laws in the U.S. and certain other countries in which we operate, a current or previous owner or operator of a facility may be liable for the removal or remediation of hazardous materials at the facility and nearby areas. Such laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, under various laws governing the generation, transportation, treatment, storage or disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, owners and operators of facilities may be\n- 13-\nliable for removal or remediation, or other corrective action at areas where hazardous materials have been released. The costs of removal, remediation, or corrective action may be substantial. The presence of hazardous materials in the environment at any of our facilities, or the failure to abate such materials promptly or properly, may adversely affect our ability to operate such facilities. Certain of these laws also impose liability for investigative, removal and remedial costs on persons who dispose of or arrange for the disposal of hazardous substances at facilities owned or operated by third parties. Liability for such costs is retroactive, strict, and joint and several.\nWe are required to comply with laws that govern the emission of pollutants into the ground, waters and the atmosphere and with laws that govern the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We are also subject to laws that regulate the manufacture, processing, and distribution of chemical substances and mixtures, as well as the transportation and disposition of certain hazardous and non-hazardous substances. In addition, certain laws govern the abatement, removal, and disposal of asbestos-containing materials and heavy metal-containing substances, the maintenance and related containment of aboveground storage tanks, the integrity of underground storage tanks, as well as equipment, which contains or is contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls. The costs of compliance with such laws and related regulations may be substantial, and regulatory standards tend to evolve towards more stringent requirements. These requirements might, from time to time, make it uneconomic or impossible to continue operating a facility. Non-compliance with such requirements at any of our facilities could result in substantial civil penalties or our inability to operate all or part of the facility, or our ability to produce and subsequently sell certain products.\nGlobal warming could have an adverse impact on our operations, particularly in hurricane prone or low-lying areas near the ocean. Initiatives in the United States and other countries to regulate certain industries and actions to reduce the impact of global warming, if made effective, could have a direct adverse impact on our operations or an indirect adverse impact by affecting our suppliers or customers.\nFurther discussion of environmental matters is in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to significant litigation expense and risk.\nWe are the subject of numerous lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of our or certain of our predecessors\u2019 businesses, including lawsuits and claims relating to product liability and personal injury, including asbestos, environmental, contractual, employment and intellectual property matters. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending environmental matters, lawsuits and claims, it is reasonably possible that there will be a necessity for future provisions for costs for environmental matters and for other contingent liabilities that we believe will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period. See \u201cItem 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\u201d for further details.\n\u2022\nOur past and future acquisitions, joint ventures, alliances, and divestitures may not achieve the anticipated synergies and benefits, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have acquired and divested businesses and product lines and entered into joint ventures and alliances in the past and plan to pursue such activities in the future. Our growth may be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition, joint venture and alliance targets and our available cash and borrowing capacity to pursue such activities. The costs incurred in completing acquisitions and participating in joint ventures and alliances as well as the time it takes to integrate acquisitions could result in unanticipated expenses and losses.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate an acquisition into our business in an efficient and effective manner, or at all, we could fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, such as increased revenue, cost savings, synergies and growth opportunities, within the anticipated time frame or at all. The integration process could disrupt our business and an unsuccessful integration could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations. In addition, the integration could result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and diversion of management\u2019s attention and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nDue to the nature of joint venture and alliances, we may share control with unaffiliated parties or entities. The joint venture or alliance may not operate or perform as anticipated if the unaffiliated parties do not fulfill their obligations or if the parties to the joint venture or alliance do not agree on key decisions or plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and results of operations.\nIf we fail to successfully complete divestitures of businesses or product lines and realize the intended benefits of such divestitures, such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and results of operations.\n- 14-\nThe final price and net gain or loss on the sale of the Coatings business and the acquisition of our metal extraction product (\u201cMEP\u201d) manufacturing facility in Nagpur, India are subject to final working capital and other customary adjustments. While we believe we have adequately accounted for all aspects of the sale of these businesses, there is a possibility that certain expenses or adjustments to working capital, environmental, tax or other matters may arise which could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\u2022\nRisks related to implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system.\nWe are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system (\u201cERP\u201d). The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team. The company\u2019s ERP will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources. In implementing the ERP, we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades while we implement the new ERP system. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant implementation issues may arise.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to cyber-security risks.\nWe are subject to cyber-security risks primarily related to breaches of security pertaining to unauthorized access and loss of our proprietary data and intellectual property due to attack by hackers, breaches, employee error, or malfeasance. In addition, our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems are vulnerable to damage from power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft or loss of our, or our customers\u2019, intellectual property or other confidential information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or in inappropriate disclosure of confidential information or intellectual property, it could lead to claims against us, affect our relationships with our customers, cause damage to our reputation, reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, interfere with regulatory compliance, and ultimately harm our business. To protect against these risks, we follow industry standard practices for employing security solutions to minimize the potential of unauthorized access or malicious activity impacting our company\u2019s systems and data. We also engage third party consultants from time to time to assess our security systems to ensure our security solutions are operating effectively. While we will continue to implement such protective measures to reduce the risk of and detect future cyber incidents, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. There can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a significant impact on our business.\n\u2022\nLegislation and regulations may affect our business and results of operations.\nIncreased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens, and a more stringent manner in which they are applied (particularly in the United States), could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole. For example, the Affordable Care Act (the \u201cACA\u201d), which was adopted in 2010 and is being phased in over several years, significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the United States; the ACA may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance and/or benefits, and may also impact various other aspects of our business. We provide benefits to our employees which are competitive within the industries in which we operate. The ACA did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012 financial results; however, we are continuing to assess the impact of the ACA on our health care benefit costs. The regulatory environment is still developing, and the potential exists for future legislation and regulations to be adopted. These developments, as well as the increasingly strict regulatory environment, may also adversely affect the customers to which, and the markets into which, we sell our products, and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen.\nWe have contracts, activities and operations domestically and internationally which are subject to United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act (and similar foreign anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws), False Claims Act, regulations relating to import and export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), technology transfer restrictions and the anti-boycott provisions of the United States Export Administration Act. Although we have implemented policies and procedures and provided training that we believe are sufficient to address these risks, we cannot be certain that we will always be in compliance with these laws and regulations. Any determination that we or our sales representatives or consultants failed to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and\n- 15-\nfines and, in extreme cases, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022\nA downturn in global economic conditions may adversely impact our customers, our suppliers, and ultimately, our results of operations and cash flows, our credit ratings, and our ability to grow.\nA lack of credit availability from the credit markets could adversely impact our customers\u2019 demand for our products, their ability to pay their accounts receivable with us, and/or their viability. We attempt to mitigate the risks associated with extending credit to our customers by maintaining detailed credit procedures and routinely updating customer credit limits. It is possible that these procedures will not fully mitigate customer collectability risk. Our results of operations in 2014 and 2013 were not significantly impacted by the inability of our customers to pay. However, the risks associated with extending credit to our customers could increase if global economic conditions or the financial viability of our customers worsen.\nAdditionally, our suppliers could be impacted by a downturn in global economic conditions in many of the same ways that such conditions would impact us. If economic conditions deteriorate or the financial viability of our suppliers worsens, our suppliers may not be able to meet their raw material commitments to us, could request shortened payment terms, or could reduce or in extreme cases eliminate the amount of credit they extend to us. Our operations in 2014 and 2013 were not significantly impacted by these factors due to the diversity of our supplier base and our materials sourcing strategies. However, it is possible that such procedures and strategy may not completely eliminate these risks.\nAs we have experienced in the past, downturns in the global economy can impact the aerospace, mining, construction, automotive, and general industrial markets that we serve and could lead to a significant reduction in our sales and operating profitability. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may be forced to take additional cost reduction initiatives that could lead to further reductions in profitability and could jeopardize our ability to fund growth programs designed to position us for success when economic conditions improve. Further, the reduced profitability and cash generation that would be triggered by a weakening of economic conditions could (1) limit the amounts we can borrow under our primary credit facility due to the covenants contained in the agreement, and (2) could unfavorably impact our credit rating. In both instances, our ability to borrow could be limited and thus our liquidity adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nChanges to certain assumptions for our pension and postretirement plans could adversely affect our operating results and liquidity.\nEarnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense or income recorded for employee benefit plans, primarily pension plans and other postretirement plans. Pensions and other postretirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age and mortality). Our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets, and by legislation and other government regulatory actions. Changes in assumptions, laws, or regulations could lead to variability in operating results and could have an adverse impact on liquidity.\n\u2022\nRisks related to new product development.\nOur ability to compete successfully and grow our business depends in part on our ability to continue to identify, develop, and commercialize new and innovative specialty chemicals and materials and new applications for such technology for our current and new markets and obtain and protect our intellectual property rights in such developments. Failure or delays in such the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 80079, "SIC": 2890, "TIC": "CYT"}
