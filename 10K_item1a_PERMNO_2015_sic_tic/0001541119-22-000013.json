Risk Factors\nWe assume and manage a certain degree of risk in order to conduct our business strategy. In addition to the risk factors described below, other risks and uncertainties not specifically mentioned, or that are currently known to, or deemed to be immaterial by management, also may materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. If any of the circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occur to a significant degree, the value of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRisks Related to Our Macroeconomic Conditions\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the way we conduct business which may adversely impact our financial results and those of our customers. The ultimate impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact economic and commercial activity and financial markets, both globally and in the United States. In our market areas, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, and closure of non-essential businesses and similar orders imposed across the United States to restrict the spread of COVID-19 in 2020 resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including business closures, supply chain disruptions, and significant layoffs and furloughs. Although local jurisdictions have subsequently lifted stay-at-home orders and moved to the opening of businesses, worker shortages, vaccine and testing requirements, new variants of COVID-19 and other health and safety recommendations have impacted the ability of businesses to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity and employment. While the overall economy has improved, disruptions to supply chains continue and significant inflation has been seen in the market. If these effects continue for a prolonged period or result in sustained economic stress or recession, many of the risk factors identified in our Form 10-K could be exacerbated, including the following risks of COVID-19, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations of the Company:\n\u2022effects on key employees, including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing, monitoring, and evaluating our financial reporting and internal controls;\n\u2022declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products, as well as a decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, owing to the effects of COVID-19 in the markets we serve;\n\u2022if the economy is unable to remain open in an efficient manner, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income;\n\u2022collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u2022allowance for loan losses may increase if borrowers experience financial difficulties, which will adversely affect net income;\n\u2022the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments;\n\u2022as long as the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s target federal funds rate remains near 0%, the yield on assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n\u2022higher operating costs, increased cybersecurity risks and potential loss of productivity as the result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely;\n\u2022increasing or protracted volatility in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, which aremay also impair our goodwill; and\n\u2022risks to capital markets that may impact the performance of our investment securities portfolio, as well as limit our access to capital markets and other funding sources.\nBecause there have been no comparable recent global pandemics that resulted in similar global impact, we do not yet know the full extent of COVID-19\u2019s effects on our business, operations, or the global economy as a whole. Any future development will be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, possible future virus variants, the effectiveness of our work-from-home arrangements, third party providers\u2019 ability to support our operations, and any actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. The uncertain future development of this crisis could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, operating results, financial condition, liquidity or capital levels.\nA worsening of economic conditions in our market area could reduce demand for our products and services and result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans, which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nSubstantially all our loans are to businesses and individuals in the state of Washington. Accordingly, local economic conditions have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans. Further, as a result of a high concentration of our customer base in the Puget Sound area and eastern Washington state regions, the deterioration of businesses in these areas, or one or more businesses with a large employee base in these areas, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. Weakness in the global economy has adversely affected many businesses operating in our markets that are dependent upon international trade and it is not known how changes in tariffs being imposed on international trade may also affect these businesses.\nA deterioration in economic conditions in the markets we serve, in particular the Puget Sound area of Washington State, could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u2022demand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022we may increase our allowance for loan losses;\n\u2022collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers\u2019 future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans;\n\u2022the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and\n\u2022the amount of our low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits may decrease.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general local, regional or national economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, severe weather, natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and leases, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses.\nRisks Related to Our Lending\nOur loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss.\nOur origination of commercial and multifamily real estate, construction and land, consumer and commercial business loans, typically present different risks to us than our one-to-four family residential loans for a number of reasons, including as follows:\n\u2022Construction and Land Loans. This type of lending is subject to the inherent difficulties in estimating both a property\u2019s value at completion of a project and the estimated cost (including interest) of the project. The uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of a completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, make it difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the completed project's loan-to-value ratio. We may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to ensure completion of the project if our estimate of the value of construction cost proves to be inaccurate. We may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss if our appraisal of the value of a completed project proves to be overstated. Disagreements between borrowers and builders and the failure of builders to pay subcontractors may also jeopardize projects. This type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and may be concentrated with a small number of builders. A downturn in housing or the real estate market could increase delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures, and significantly impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Some of the builders we deal with have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss. In addition, during the term of some of our construction loans, no payment from the borrower is required since the accumulated interest is added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve. Increases in market rates of interest may have a more pronounced effect on construction loans by rapidly increasing the end-purchaser's borrowing costs, thereby possibly reducing the homeowner's ability to finance the home upon completion or the overall demand for the project. Properties under construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold which also complicates the process of managing our problem construction loans. This may require us to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder to complete construction and assume the market risk of selling the project at a future market price, which may or may not enable us to fully recover unpaid loan funds and associated construction and liquidation costs. Loans on land under development or held for future construction also pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral. These risks can be significantly impacted by supply and demand. As a result, this type of lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell\nor lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to independently repay principal and interest.\nConstruction loans made by us include those with a sales contract or permanent loan in place for the finished homes and those for which purchasers for the finished homes may not be identified either during or following the construction period, known as speculative construction loans. Speculative construction loans to a builder pose a greater potential risk to us than construction loans to individuals on their personal residences. We attempt to mitigate this risk by actively monitoring the number of unsold homes in our construction loan portfolio and local housing markets to attempt to maintain an appropriate balance between home sales and new loan originations. In addition, the maximum number of speculative construction loans (loans that are not pre-sold) approved for each builder is based on a combination of factors, including the financial capacity of the builder, the market demand for the finished product and the ratio of sold to unsold inventory the builder maintains. We have also attempted to diversify the risk associated with speculative construction lending by doing business with a large number of small and mid-sized builders spread over a relatively large geographic region representing numerous sub-markets within our service area.\n\u2022Commercial and Multifamily Real Estate Loans. These loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans and some of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential mortgage loan. Repayment of these loans is dependent upon income being generated from the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. In addition, many of our commercial and multifamily real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. Such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment. If we foreclose on a commercial or multifamily real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for one-to-four family residential loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral.\nIn recent years, commercial real estate markets have been experiencing substantial growth, and increased competitive pressures have contributed significantly to historically low capitalization rates and rising property values. Furthermore, commercial real estate markets have been particularly impacted by the economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also been a catalyst for the evolution of various remote work options which could impact the long-term performance of some types of properties within our commercial real estate portfolio. Accordingly, the federal banking regulatory agencies have expressed concerns about weaknesses in the current commercial real estate market. Failures in our risk management policies, procedures and controls could adversely affect our ability to manage this portfolio going forward and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in, and increased losses from, this portfolio, which, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Commercial Business Loans. Our commercial business loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. A borrower's cash flow may prove to be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most often, this collateral includes accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or real estate. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. Other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise, may be illiquid and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.\n\u2022Consumer Loans. Generally, we consider these loans to involve a different degree of risk compared to first mortgage loans on one-to-four family residential properties. As a result of our large portfolio of these loans, it may become necessary to increase the level of our provision for loan losses, which could decrease our profits. Consumer loans generally entail greater risk than do one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as floating homes, manufactured homes, automobiles and recreational vehicles. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. Manufactured homes are a riskier form of collateral, though this risk is reduced if the owner also owns the land on which the home is located, because they are costly and difficult to relocate when repossessed, and difficult to sell due to the diminishing number of manufactured home parks in the Puget Sound area. Additionally, a good portion of our manufactured home loan borrowers are first-time home buyers, who tend to be a higher credit risk than first-time home buyers of single family residences, due to more limited financial resources. As a result, these loans tend to have a higher probability of default, higher delinquency rates and greater servicing costs than other types of consumer loans. Our floating home, houseboat and house barge loans are typically located on cooperative or condominium moorages. The primary risk in floating home loans is the unique nature of the collateral\nand the challenges of relocating such collateral to a location other than where such housing is permitted. The process for securing the deed and/or the condominium or cooperative dock is also unique compared to other types of lending we participate in. As a result, these loans may have higher collateral recovery costs than for one-to-four family mortgage loans and other types of consumer loans.\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property and declining property values.\nOur first-lien one-to-four family real estate loans are primarily made based on the repayment ability of the borrower and the collateral securing these loans. Home equity lines of credit generally entail greater risk than do one-to-four family residential mortgage loans where we are in the first-lien position. For those home equity lines secured by a second mortgage, it is less likely that we will be successful in recovering all of our loan proceeds in the event of default. Our foreclosure on these loans requires that the value of the property be sufficient to cover the repayment of the first mortgage loan, as well as the costs associated with foreclosure.\nThis type of lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. A downturn in the economy or the housing market in our market areas or a rapid increase in interest rates may reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans and increase the risk that we would incur losses if borrowers default on their loans. Residential loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios generally will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their homes, the borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds. As a result, these loans may experience higher rates of delinquencies, defaults and losses, which will in turn adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. A majority of our residential loans are \u201cnon-conforming\u201d because they are adjustable-rate mortgages which contain interest rate floors or do not satisfy credit or other requirements due to personal and financial reasons (i.e., divorce, bankruptcy, length of time employed, etc.), conforming loan limits (i.e., jumbo mortgages), and other requirements imposed by secondary market purchasers. Some of these borrowers have higher debt-to-income ratios, or the loans are secured by unique properties in rural markets for which there are no sales of comparable properties to support the value according to secondary market requirements. We may require additional collateral or lower loan-to-value ratios to reduce the risk of these loans. We believe that these loans satisfy a need in our local market areas. As a result, subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to originate these types of loans.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or we may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures. Future additions to our allowance for loan losses, as well as charge-offs in excess of reserves, will reduce our earnings.\nOur business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. As with most financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to reflect potential defaults and nonperformance, which represents management's best estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management's estimate is based on our continuing evaluation of specific credit risks and loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions, industry concentrations and other factors that may indicate future loan losses. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. There is no certainty that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the loan portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets. If the credit quality of our loan portfolio materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, or if the allowance for loan losses is not adequate, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Market and Interest Rate Changes\nFluctuating interest rates can adversely affect our profitability.\nNet income is the amount by which net interest income and noninterest income exceed noninterest expense, the provision for loan losses and taxes. Net interest income makes up a majority of our net income and is based on the difference between the interest income we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe yields we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Like many financial institutions, our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time. In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest we pay on our liabilities. A decline in interest rates results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers refinance their debt to\nreduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Furthermore, an inverted interest rate yield curve, where short-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions borrow funds) are higher than long-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions lend funds for fixed-rate loans) can reduce a financial institution\u2019s net interest margin and create financial risk for financial institutions that originate longer-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans. At December 31, 2021, 52.2% of our loan portfolio consisted of fixed-rate loans.\nAny substantial prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) of the Federal Reserve System, lowered the target range for the federal funds rate 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%. However, the FOMC has recently indicated it expects to increase rates starting in 2022, by implementing three one quarter point increases. Future increases in the targeted federal funds rate, may negatively impact both the housing markets by reducing refinancing activity and new home purchases and the U.S. economy. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect the value of our assets and liabilities and ultimately affect our earnings.\nChanges in the valuation of our securities portfolio could hurt our profits and reduce our capital levels.\nOur securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Management evaluates securities for OTTI on a quarterly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. In analyzing a debt issuer\u2019s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred and industry analysts\u2019 reports. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. Declines in market value could result in OTTI losses on these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels. At December 31, 2021, we have no securities that are deemed impaired.\nAn increase in interest rates, change in the programs offered by Fannie Mae or our ability to qualify for its programs may reduce our mortgage revenues, which would negatively impact our noninterest income.\nThe sale of residential mortgage loans to Fannie Mae provides a significant portion of our non-interest income. Any future changes in its program, our eligibility to participate in such program, the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of Fannie Mae could, in turn, materially adversely affect our results of operations if we could not find other purchasers. Mortgage banking is generally considered a volatile source of income because it depends largely on the level of loan volume which, in turn, depends largely on prevailing market interest rates. In a rising or higher interest-rate environment, the demand for mortgage loans, particularly refinancing of existing mortgage loans, tends to fall and our originations of mortgage loans may decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold. This would result in a decrease in mortgage revenues and a corresponding decrease in noninterest income. In addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of noninterest expense associated with our loan sale activities, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment and data processing expense and other operating costs. During periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in loan originations. In addition, although we sell loans to Fannie Mae or into the secondary market without recourse, we are required to give customary representations and warranties about the loans we sell. If we breach those representations and warranties, we may be required to repurchase the loans and we may incur a loss on the repurchase.\nWe may incur losses in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights due to changes in prepayment rates.\nOur mortgage servicing rights carry interest-rate risk because the total amount of servicing fees earned, as well as changes in fair market value, fluctuate based on expected loan prepayments (affecting the expected average life of a portfolio of residential mortgage servicing rights). The rate of prepayment of residential mortgage loans may be influenced by changing national and regional economic trends, such as recessions or stagnating real estate markets, as well as the difference between interest rates on existing residential mortgage loans relative to prevailing residential mortgage rates. During periods of declining interest rates, many residential borrowers refinance their mortgage loans. Changes in prepayment rates are therefore difficult for us to predict. The loan administration fee income (related to the residential mortgage loan servicing rights corresponding to a mortgage loan) decreases as mortgage loans are prepaid. Consequently, in the event of an increase in prepayment rates, we would expect the\nfair value of portfolios of residential mortgage loan servicing rights to decrease along with the amount of loan administration income received.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Data and Fraud\nA failure in or breach of our security systems or infrastructure, including breaches resulting from cyber-attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. Those parties also may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose confidential information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks, either managed directly by us or through our data processing vendors. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal computers, smartphones, tablet PCs, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we believe we have robust information security procedures and controls, we rely heavily on our third party vendors, technologies, systems, networks and our customers' devices all of which may become the target of cyber-attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, unauthorized access, hackers or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, theft or destruction of our confidential, proprietary and other information or that of our customers, or disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties.\nTo date, we have not incurred any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks, breaches and losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats and our plans to continue to evolve our internet banking and mobile banking channel. As a result, the continued development and enhancement of our information security controls, processes and practices designed to protect customer information, our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for our management. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to insure, modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate important information security vulnerabilities or exposures; however, our measures may be insufficient to prevent all physical and electronic break-ins, denial of service and other cyber-attacks or security breaches.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition, uninsured financial losses, the inability of our customers to transact business with us, employee productivity losses, technology replacement costs, incident response costs, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, additional regulatory scrutiny, reputational damage, litigation, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe failure to protect our customers' confidential information and privacy could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to federal and state privacy regulations and confidentiality obligations that, among other things restrict the use and dissemination of, and access to, certain information that we produce, store or maintain in the course of our business. We also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors and customers.\nThese obligations generally include protecting such confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information, and in some instances may impose indemnity obligations on us relating to unlawful or unauthorized disclosure of any such information.\nIf we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and contractual obligations that require us to protect confidential information, or if we experience a security breach or network compromise, we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory sanctions, penalties or fines, increased compliance costs, remedial costs such as providing credit monitoring or other services to affected customers, litigation and damage to our reputation, which in turn could result in decreased revenues and loss of customers, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations rely on certain external vendors.\nWe rely on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. These third-party vendors are sources of operational and informational security risks to us, including risks associated with operational errors, information system failures, interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive or confidential client or\ncustomer information. If these vendors encounter any of these issues, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, we could be exposed to disruption of operations, loss of service or connectivity to customers, reputational damage, and litigation risk that could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to invest in technological improvements.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many national vendors provide turn-key services to community banks, such as internet banking and remote deposit capture that allow smaller banks to compete with institutions that have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able, however, to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers.\nOur business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes.\nAs a bank, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our customers, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our customers, disclosure or misuse of our information or our customer\u2019s information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our customers, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We have also experienced losses due to apparent fraud and other financial crimes. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses, there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur.\nRegulatory and Accounting-Related Risks\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations that could increase our costs of operations.\nThe banking industry is extensively regulated. Federal banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to benefit a company's shareholders. These regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on our operations. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. Any new regulations or legislation, change in existing regulation or oversight, whether a change in regulatory policy or a change in a regulator's interpretation of a law or regulation, could have a material impact on our operations, increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business and adversely affect our profitability. In this regard, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\"FinCEN\"), published guidelines in 2014 for financial institutions servicing cannabis businesses that are legal under state law. These guidelines generally allow us to work with cannabis-related businesses that are operating in accordance with state laws and regulations, so long as we comply with required regulatory oversight of their accounts with us. In addition, legislation is currently pending in Congress that would allow banks and financial institutions to serve cannabis businesses in states where it is legal without any risk of federal prosecution. At December 31, 2021, approximately 2.9% of our total deposits and a portion of our service charges from deposits are from legal cannabis-related businesses. Similarly, accounting changes which have been approved for future implementation include requirements that we calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses on the basis of the current expected credit losses over the lifetime of our loans, referred to as the CECL model, which is expected to be applicable to us, as a smaller reporting company, beginning in 2023. CECL adoption will have broad impact on our financial statements, which will affect key profitability and solvency measures, including, but not limited to higher loan loss reserve levels and related deferred tax assets. Increased reserve levels also may lead to a reduction in capital levels. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny adverse change in this FinCEN guidance, any new regulations or legislation, any change in existing regulations or oversight, whether a change in regulatory policy or a change in a regulator's interpretation of a law or regulation, could have a negative impact on our non-interest income, as well as the cost of our operations, increasing our cost of regulatory compliance and of doing business and/or otherwise affect us, which may materially affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in civil or criminal sanctions and money penalties by state and federal agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSee \u201cPart I, Item 1. Business - How We Are Regulated\u201d in this Form 10-K for more information about the regulations to which we are subject.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and we use estimates in determining the fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be imprecise and result in significant changes in valuation.\nA portion of our assets are carried on the balance sheet at fair value, including investment securities available for sale, mortgage servicing rights related to single-family loans, and single-family loans held for sale. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices or valuation models that use observable market data inputs to estimate their fair value. In certain cases, observable market prices and data may not be readily available, or their availability may be diminished due to market conditions. We use financial models to value certain of these assets. These models are complex and use asset-specific collateral data and market inputs for interest rates. Although we have processes and procedures in place governing valuation models and their review, such assumptions are complex, as we must make judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions could result in significant changes in valuation, which in turn could affect earnings or result in significant changes in the dollar amount of assets reported on the balance sheet.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry Generally\nWe will be required to transition from the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) in the future.\nWe have certain FHLB advances, brokered deposits, loans and investment securities indexed to LIBOR to calculate the loan interest rate. The continued availability of the LIBOR index is not guaranteed after 2023. We cannot predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR (with the exception of overnight repurchase agreements, which are expected to be based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR). The language in our LIBOR-based contracts and financial instruments has developed over time and may have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. If a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments may give the calculation agent discretion over the substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates to be selected. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers may result in our incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIneffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nEffective liquidity management is essential to our business. We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances, including events causing industry or general financial market stress. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans or investment securities and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. We rely on customer deposits and at times, borrowings from the FHLB of Des Moines and the Federal Reserve and certain other wholesale funding sources to fund our operations. Deposit flows and the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates, whether actual or perceived, and the competition for deposits and loans in the markets we serve. Further, changes to the FHLB of Des Moines's underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings or lending policies may limit or restrict our ability to borrow, and could therefore have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and borrowings if desired, we may not be able to replace such funds in the future if, among other things, our financial condition, the financial condition of the FHLB of Des Moines, or market conditions change. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry or deterioration in credit markets. Additional factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our deposits and loans are concentrated, negative operating results, or adverse regulatory action against us. Any decline in available funding in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSocietal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers.\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. We and our customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations, as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset-value reductions and operating process changes. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Among the impacts to us could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\nIf our enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss to us, we could suffer unexpected losses and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe maintain an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, quantify, monitor, report, and control the risks that we face. These risks include interest-rate, credit, liquidity, operations, reputation, compliance and litigation. We also maintain a compliance program to identify, measure, assess, and report on our adherence to applicable laws, policies and procedures. While we assess and improve these programs on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that our risk management or compliance programs, along with other related controls, will effectively mitigate all risk and limit losses in our business. As with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our data management or aggregation.\nWe are reliant on our ability to manage data and our ability to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner to ensure effective risk reporting and management. Our ability to manage and aggregate data may be limited by the effectiveness of our policies, programs, processes and practices that govern how data is acquired, validated, stored, protected and processed. While we continuously update our policies, programs, processes and practices, many of our data management and aggregation processes are manual and subject to human error or system failure. Failure to manage data effectively and to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner may limit our ability to manage current and emerging risks, as well as to manage changing business needs.\nOur growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed, or the cost of that capital may be very high.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. At some point, we may need to raise additional capital to support our growth or replenish future losses. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any additional capital we obtain may result in the dilution of the interests of existing holders of our common stock. Further, if we are unable to raise additional capital when required by our bank regulators, we may be subject to adverse regulatory action.\nAs a community bank, maintaining our reputation in our market area is critical to the success of our business, and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our current market and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. We provide many different financial products and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a significant number of transactions. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company may not attract and retain skilled employees.\nThe Company's success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people can be intense, and the Company spends considerable time and resources attracting and hiring qualified people for its operations. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of the Company's key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business because of their skills, knowledge of the Company's market, and years of industry experience, as well as the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nThe Company's ability to pay dividends and make subordinated debt payments is subject to the ability of the Bank to make capital distributions to the Company.\nThe Company is a separate legal entity from its subsidiary and does not have significant operations of its own. The long-term ability of the Company to pay dividends to its stockholders and debt payments is based primarily upon the ability of the Bank to make capital distributions to the Company, and also on the availability of cash at the holding company level. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by the Bank's earnings and capital, as well as various statutes and regulations. Under certain circumstances, capital distributions from the Bank to the Company may be subject to regulatory approvals. In the event, the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to pay dividends on its common stock or make payments on its outstanding debt. Consequently, the inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. At December 31, 2021, Sound Financial Bancorp had $4.2 million in unrestricted cash to support dividend and debt payments. See \"Part I. Item 1.
