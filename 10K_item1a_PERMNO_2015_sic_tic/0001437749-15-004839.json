{"cik": "713095", "company": "FARMERS CAPITAL BANK CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in the Company\u2019s common stock is subject to risks inherent to the Company\u2019s business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline significantly, and shareholders could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change in applicable regulations or laws could have a substantial adverse impact on the Company and its operations. Additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect the Company\u2019s powers, authority, and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Further, in the performance of their supervisory duties and enforcement powers, the Company\u2019s banking regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy practices they deem as unsafe or unsound or violations of law. The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s operations, which may be material to its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company presently is subject to, and in the future may become subject to, additional supervisory actions and/or enhanced regulation that could have a material negative effect on its business, operating flexibility, financial condition and the value of its common stock.\nUnder federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, the KDFI (for state-chartered banks), the Federal Reserve (for bank holding companies), and the FDIC as the insurer of bank deposits, have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on the Company\u2019s part if they determine that the Company has insufficient capital or is otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under this authority, bank regulators can require the Company to enter into informal or formal enforcement orders, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which the Company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions.\nIf the Company is unable to comply with the terms of its current or future regulatory orders to which it may become subject, then it could become subject to additional, heightened supervisory actions and orders, possibly including cease and desist orders, prompt corrective actions, and/or other regulatory enforcement actions. If the Company\u2019s regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. If one or more of the Company\u2019s banks were unable to comply with regulatory requirements, such banks could ultimately face failure. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business, operating flexibility, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nOur nonperforming assets adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and take significant management time to resolve.\nThe Company\u2019s level of nonperforming assets (which include performing restructured loans) continue to improve, but remain elevated. Nonperforming assets adversely affect the Company\u2019s net income in several ways. The Company does not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting interest income. When the Company repossesses collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to record the property at its fair value less estimated selling costs, which typically decreases net income.\nNonperforming loans and other real estate owned also increase our risk profile and the amount of capital the Company\u2019s regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks. While the Company seeks to reduce its problem loans through workouts, restructurings, and otherwise, decreases in the value of these assets, the underlying collateral, or our borrowers\u2019 performance or financial conditions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management of our banks, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience further increases in nonperforming loans in the future. If economic conditions do not improve or worsen in our markets, the Company could continue to incur additional losses relating to an increase in nonperforming assets.\nLosses from loan defaults may exceed the allowance established for that purpose, which will have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nVolatility and deterioration in the broader economy increases the Company\u2019s risk of credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. If a significant number of loans in the Company\u2019s portfolio are not repaid, it would have an adverse effect on its earnings and overall financial condition. The Company\u2019s bank subsidiaries each maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses reflects management\u2019s best estimate of probable incurred credit losses in their loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. This evaluation is primarily based upon a review of the bank\u2019s historical loan loss experience, known risks contained in the bank\u2019s loan portfolio, composition and growth of the bank\u2019s loan portfolio, and economic factors. Additionally, a bank\u2019s regulators may require additional provision for the loan portfolio in connection with their examinations, agreements, or orders. The determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions. As a result, the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may be inadequate to cover actual losses in its loan portfolio. Consequently, the Company risks having additional future provision for loan losses that may materially affect its earnings.\nIf the Company\u2019s local markets experience a prolonged recession or economic downturn, it may be required to make further increases in its allowance for loan losses and to charge off additional loans, which would adversely affect its results of operations and capital.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s loans are to businesses and individuals located in Kentucky. A continuing or prolonged decline in the Central and Northern Kentucky economies could negatively impact demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, the ability of customers to repay their loans, collateral values securing loans, and the stability of funding sources. This could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, substantially all of the Company\u2019s investments in municipal bonds are issued by political subdivisions or agencies located in Kentucky.\nGenerally, the Company\u2019s nonperforming loans and assets reflect operating difficulties of individual borrowers; however, the overall economic decline and slow growth of recent years has become a significant contributing factor to the increased levels of nonperforming loans. Sluggish sales and excess inventory in the residential housing market continue to exist and has been the primary cause of elevated delinquencies and foreclosures in recent years. If trends in the housing and real estate markets worsen, the Company expects that it will experience an increase in delinquencies and credit losses. As a result, the Company may be required to increase its provision for loan losses and charge off additional loans in the future, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially. If additional provisions and charge-offs cause the Company to experience losses, it may be required to contribute additional capital to its bank subsidiaries to maintain capital ratios required by regulators.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to credit risk is increased by its real estate development lending.\nReal estate development lending has historically been considered to be higher credit risk than that of other types of lending, such as for single-family residential properties. At year-end 2014, 11% of the outstanding balance of real estate development loans was classified as impaired. Real estate development loans typically involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or related borrowers. These loans can be affected by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy in general because commercial real estate borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans depends on successful development and, in most cases, sale of the underlying property. These loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortized over the loan period, but have a balloon payment due at maturity of the loan. A borrower\u2019s ability to make a balloon payment typically depends on being able to either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property. In the current economic environment, the ability of borrowers to refinance or sell newly developed property or vacant land remains challenging. If the real estate markets were to worsen or not improve, the Company likely will experience increased credit losses and require additional provisions to our allowance for loan losses, which would adversely impact the Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s investment securities portfolio is comparatively larger than other community banks and it is more dependent on its investment portfolio to generate net income.\nThe Company relies more heavily on its investment securities portfolio as a source of interest income than many other community banks because its loan portfolio makes up a smaller proportion of its earning assets. If the Company is not able to successfully manage the interest rate spread on the investment portfolio, its net interest income will decrease, which would adversely affect its results of operations and negatively impact net income. Investment securities tend to have a lower risk than loans, and as such, generally provide a lower yield. For 2014, average investment securities made up 35.0% of the Company\u2019s average total assets. Interest income on investment securities accounted for 22.2% of total interest income for 2014.\nThe Company periodically sells investment securities at irregular intervals in the normal course of business to execute its current asset/liability management strategies. This will result in the realization of either a net gain or loss. Moreover, proceeds from sales may be reinvested in investment securities with lower yields, which could reduce future earnings from investment securities. The Company monitors its investment securities portfolio for deteriorating values and for other-than-temporary impairment. Any material other-than-temporary impairment charges would likewise have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and could lead to additional losses.\nThe Company cannot accurately predict the effect of the current economy on its future results of operations or the market price of its stock.\nThe national economy and the financial services sector in particular continue to face challenges stemming from the economic recession of 2007 to 2009. The Company cannot accurately predict the severity or duration of the current economic slowdown, which has adversely impacted its performance and the markets it serves. Any further deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in the Company\u2019s local markets would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and prospects and could also cause the market price of the Company\u2019s stock to decline. While it is impossible to predict how long these conditions may exist, the economic slowdown could continue to present risks for some time for our industry and the Company.\nInterest rate volatility could significantly harm the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, the policies of its regulators, and the prevailing interest rates in the United States and the Company\u2019s markets. In addition, it is increasingly common for the Company\u2019s competitors, who may be aggressively seeking to attract deposits as a result of liquidity concerns arising from changing economic or other conditions, to pay rates on deposits that are much higher than normal market rates. A significant component of the Company\u2019s earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between the income from interest earning assets, such as loans, and the expense on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits. A change in market interest rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings if market interest rates change such that the interest it pays on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest it collects on loans and investments; or, alternatively, if interest rates earned on earning assets decline faster than those rates paid on interest paying liabilities. Consequently, as with most financial institutions, the Company is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Changes in market interest rates may also affect the level of voluntary prepayments on loans and mortgage-back investment securities resulting in the receipt of funds that may be reinvested at a lower rate.\nThe FDIC periodically amends its deposit insurance rate assessment structure, which can increase costs to the Company.\nUnder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC must establish and implement a plan to restore the deposit insurance fund\u2019s designated reserve ratio to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020. The FDIC must continue to assess and consider the appropriate level of the reserve ratio annually by considering each of the following: risk of loss to the insurance fund; economic conditions affecting the banking industry; the prevention of sharp swings in the assessment rates; and any other factors the FDIC deems important. The FDIC\u2019s current fund management strategy includes a targeted long-term reserve ratio of 2.0%.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required changes to a number of components of the FDIC insurance assessment. While these changes have resulted in a lower amount of deposit insurance assessments for the Company, future changes in assessment rates or methodology could adversely impact the Company\u2019s future earnings and liquidity in a material amount.\nAny future losses may require the Company to raise additional capital; however, such capital may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.\nThe Company is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain certain levels of capital to support its operations. Furthermore, as a result of regularly scheduled regulatory examinations, two of the Company\u2019s subsidiary banks were required to maintain capital levels significantly above the well-capitalized benchmark at year-end 2014. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time and on the Company\u2019s future financial condition and performance. Accordingly, the Company cannot make assurances with respect to its ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. If the Company cannot raise additional capital when needed, its ability to further expand its operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and its financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. The Parent Company is currently under no directive by its regulators to raise any additional capital.\nThe tightening of available liquidity could limit the Company\u2019s ability to replace deposits and fund loan demand, which could adversely affect its earnings and capital levels.\nLiquidity is crucial to the Company\u2019s business. A tightening of the credit and liquidity markets and the Company\u2019s inability to obtain adequate funding to replace deposits may negatively affect its earnings and capital levels. In addition to deposit growth, maturity of investment securities, and loan payments from borrowers, the Company relies from time to time on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank and other wholesale funding sources to fund loans and replace deposits. In the event of a downturn in the economy, these additional funding sources could be negatively affected which could limit the funds available to the Company. The Company\u2019s liquidity position could be significantly constrained if it were unable to access funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank or other wholesale funding sources.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and outlook may be adversely affected by damage to its reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and outlook is highly dependent upon perceptions of its business practices and reputation. Its ability to attract and retain customers and employees could be adversely affected to the extent its reputation is damaged. Negative public opinion could result from its actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including regulatory actions taken against the Company, lending practices, corporate governance, regulatory compliance, mergers of its subsidiaries, or sharing or inadequate protection of customer information. Damage to the Company\u2019s reputation could give rise to loss of customers and legal risks, which could have an adverse impact on its financial condition.\nThe Company faces strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services.\nThe Company conducts most of its operations in Central and Northern Kentucky. The banking and financial services businesses in these areas are highly competitive and increased competition in its primary market areas may adversely impact the level of its loans and deposits. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. These competitors include national banks, regional banks, and other community banks. The Company also faces competition from other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks, and other financial intermediaries. The Company\u2019s competitors include major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain loan and deposit customers, and a range in quality of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. If the Company is unable to attract and retain banking customers, it may be unable to increase its loans and level of deposits.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult to resell the stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.\nThe Company cannot predict how its common stock will trade in the future. The market value of its common stock will likely continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors including the following, most of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions and conditions in the financial markets;\n\u25cf\nchanges in global financial markets, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility, and other geopolitical events;\n\u25cf\nconditions in our local and national credit, mortgage, and housing markets;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments with respect to financial institutions generally, including government regulation;\n\u25cf\nour dividend practice; and\n\u25cf\nactual and anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and earnings.\nThe market value of the Company\u2019s common stock may also be impacted by conditions affecting the financial markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations. These conditions may result in: (1) volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, the market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, the Company\u2019s common stock and (2) sales of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s common stock in the market, in each case that could be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the Company\u2019s operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThere may be future sales of additional common stock or other dilution of the Company\u2019s equity, which may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company is not restricted from issuing additional common or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline as a result of sales by the Company of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or from the perception that such sales could occur.\nThe Company\u2019s board of directors is authorized generally to cause it to issue additional common and preferred stock without any action on the part of the Company\u2019s shareholders, except as may be required under the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. In addition, the board has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences, and other terms. This could include preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon liquidation. If the Company issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, or if the Company issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected. The Parent Company is currently under no directive by its regulators to raise any additional capital.\nYou may not receive dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, as, and if its board of directors declares them and as permitted by its regulators. Although the Company historically (up through 2009) declared quarterly cash dividends on its common stock, it is not required to do so.\nAs a result of the termination in March 2014 of its agreement with its banking regulators, the Company is no longer required to receive permission from its regulators to make interest payments on its trust preferred securities or to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock. The Company\u2019s current goal, however, is to redeem all of its outstanding preferred stock before considering the payment of a dividend on its common stock. The Company redeemed 20,000 shares, or two-thirds, of its original outstanding preferred stock during 2014. The Company intends to redeem its remaining 10,000 shares of preferred stock in 2015, although this action requires approval by our banking regulators. The timing and amount of any further redemption by the Company of its remaining outstanding preferred stock will be disclosed when assured.\nDividends declared and discount accretion on the Company\u2019s Series A preferred stock reduce the net income available to common stockholders and reduce earnings per common share. Moreover, under the terms of the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation, it is unable to declare dividend payments on shares of its common stock if it is in arrears on the dividends on the Series A preferred stock. If the Company is in arrears on interest payments on its trust preferred securities, it may not pay dividends on its common stock until such interest obligations are brought current.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends depends upon the results of operations of its subsidiary banks and certain regulatory considerations.\nThe Parent Company is a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiary banks. As a result, the Company\u2019s ability to make dividend payments on its common stock depends primarily on certain federal and state regulatory considerations and the receipt of dividends and other distributions from its bank subsidiaries. There are also restrictions on the ability of two of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends or make other payments to the Parent Company related to current regulatory agreements that are in effect, thus further restricting the Parent Company\u2019s ability to make payments to its shareholders.\nThe trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock is less than that of many other similar companies.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Stock Market. As of December 31, 2014, the 50-day average trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock on NASDAQ was 9,982 shares or .13% of the total common shares outstanding of 7,489,388. An efficient public trading market is dependent upon the existence in the marketplace of willing buyers and willing sellers of a stock at any given time. The Company has no control over such individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions. Given the lower trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock, larger sales volumes of its common stock could cause the value of its common stock to decrease. Moreover, due to its lower trading volume, it may take longer to liquidate your position in the Company\u2019s common stock without detrimentally affecting the price.\nThere can be no assurance when the Company\u2019s remaining Series A preferred stock can be redeemed.\nSubject to consultation with, and approval from its banking regulators, the Company intends to repurchase the remaining 10,000 shares of its Series A preferred stock. However, there can be no assurance when the shares can be repurchased, if at all. Until such time as the Series A preferred stock is repurchased, the Company will remain subject to the terms and conditions of the instrument, which, among other things, limit the Company\u2019s ability to repurchase or redeem common stock.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s Series A preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of the Company\u2019s common stockholders.\nThe Company\u2019s Series A preferred stock is senior to the Company\u2019s shares of common stock, and holders of the Series A preferred stock have certain rights and preferences that are senior to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock. The restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends to common stockholders are discussed above. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries may not purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of the Company\u2019s common stock unless the Company has paid in full all accrued dividends on the Series A preferred stock for all prior dividend periods, other than in certain circumstances. Furthermore, the Series A preferred stock is entitled to a liquidation preference over shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in the event of liquidation, dissolution, or winding up.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s Series A preferred stock have limited voting rights.\nExcept (1) in connection with the election of two directors to the Company\u2019s board of directors if its dividends on the Series A preferred stock are in arrears and we have missed six quarterly dividends and (2) as otherwise required by law, holders of the Company\u2019s Series A preferred stock have limited voting rights. In addition to any other vote or consent of shareholders required by law or the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation, the vote or consent of holders owning at least 66 2/3% of the shares of Series A preferred stock outstanding is required for (1) any authorization or issuance of shares ranking senior to the Series A preferred stock; (2) any amendment to the rights of the Series A preferred stock that adversely affects the rights, preferences, privileges, or voting power of the Series A preferred stock; or (3) consummation of any merger, share exchange, or similar transaction unless the shares of Series A preferred stock remain outstanding or are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity other than the Company and have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting power as are not materially less favorable than those of the holders of the Series A preferred stock.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock constitutes equity and is subordinate to its existing and future indebtedness and its Series A preferred stock, and is effectively subordinated to all the indebtedness and other non-common equity claims against its subsidiaries.\nShares of the Company\u2019s common stock represent equity interests in the Parent Company and do not constitute indebtedness. Accordingly, the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock rank junior to all of its indebtedness and to other non-equity claims on Farmers Capital Bank Corporation with respect to assets available to satisfy such claims. Additionally, dividends to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the Company\u2019s Series A preferred stock and any additional preferred stock we may issue. The Series A preferred stock has a liquidation preference at December 31, 2014 of $1 thousand per share, or $10.0 million in the aggregate, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.\nThe Company\u2019s right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of its subsidiaries upon the subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or otherwise, and thus the ability of the Company\u2019s common stockholders to benefit indirectly from such distribution, will be subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. As a result, holders of the Company\u2019s common stock are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of its subsidiaries, including claims of depositors.\nThe current economic environment exposes the Company to higher credit losses and expenses and may result in lower earnings or increase the likelihood of losses.\nAlthough the Company remains well-capitalized, it continues to operate in a very challenging and uncertain economic environment. Financial institutions, including the Company, continue to be adversely effected by difficult economic conditions that have impacted not only local markets, but on a national and global scale. Substantial deterioration in real estate and other financial markets in recent years, although improving, have and may continue to adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial performance. Declines in real estate values and home sales volumes, along with historically low labor participation rates and other economic stresses, can decrease the value of collateral securing loans extended to borrowers, particularly that of real estate loans. A decrease in the value of real estate securing loans may make it more difficult for the Company to recover amounts it is owed in the event of default by a borrower.\nCurrent economic conditions may result in a higher degree of financial stress on the Company\u2019s borrowers and their customers which could impair the Company\u2019s ability to collect payments on loans, potentially increasing loan delinquencies, nonperforming assets, foreclosures, and losses. Current market forces have and may in the future cause the value of investment securities or other assets held by the Company to deteriorate, resulting in impairment charges, higher losses, and lower regulatory capital levels.\nMarket volatility could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity position, and access to additional capital.\nThe capital and credit markets experienced heavy volatility and disruptions during much of the most recent economic downturn, with unprecedented levels of volatility and other disruptions. In many cases, this led to downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. If similar market disruptions and volatility recur, the Company may experience a material adverse effect on its results of operations and liquidity position or on its ability to access additional capital.\nRisks associated with unpredictable economic and political conditions may be amplified as a result of limited market area.\nCommercial banks and other financial institutions, including the Company, are affected by economic and political conditions, both domestic and international, and by governmental monetary policies. These conditions and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control may adversely affect profitability. In addition, almost all of the Company\u2019s primary business area is located in Central and Northern Kentucky. Significant downturns in this economic region may result in a deterioration of the Company\u2019s credit quality, reduce demand for credit, and may harm the financial stability of the Company\u2019s customers. Due to the Company\u2019s regional market area, these negative conditions may have a more noticeable effect on the Company than would be experienced by an institution with a larger, more diverse market area.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are significantly affected by the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans.\nLending money is an essential part of the banking business. However, borrowers do not always repay their loans. The risk of non-payment is affected by:\n\u25cf\nunanticipated declines in borrower income or cash flow;\n\u25cf\nchanges in economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nthe duration of the loan; and\n\u25cf\nin the case of a collateralized loan, uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral.\nDue to the fact that the outstanding principal balances can be larger for commercial loans than other types of loans, such loans present a greater risk to the Company than other types of loans when non-payment by a borrower occurs.\nConsumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields compared to real estate mortgage loans, but generally carry higher risks of frequency of default than real estate mortgage and commercial loans. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower\u2019s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans.\nInability to hire or retain certain key professionals, management, and staff could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and net income.\nThe Company relies on key personnel to manage and operate its business, including major revenue generating functions such as its loan and deposit portfolios. The loss of key staff may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively, which could negatively affect our revenues. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which could cause a decrease in our net income.\nThe Company\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nThe Company\u2019s management regularly reviews and updates its internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system of controls are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Company\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company offers online banking services and both sends and receives confidential customer information electronically. This activity is vulnerable to security breaches and computer viruses which could expose the Company to litigation and adversely affect our reputation and overall operations.\nThe secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is a significant element of online banking. The Company has implemented administrative, technical, and physical security controls and testing procedures to safeguard its customer information. However, those controls could be circumvented or fail, leaving the Company\u2019s computer network or those of its customers vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, and other security problems. The Company could be required to commit additional resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to remedy problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the Company\u2019s activities or the activities of its customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose the Company to litigation and other possible liabilities. The inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s systems and could adversely affect its reputation and overall operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on certain external vendors.\nThe Company utilizes certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain its day-to-day operations. The Company is exposed to the risk that such vendors fail to perform under these arrangements. This could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s business and have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s policies and procedures designed to monitor and mitigate vendor risks will be effective in preventing or limiting the effect of vendor non-performance.\nThe Company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nThe Company\u2019s customers or others may make claims and take legal action against us related to fiduciary responsibilities. If claims and legal action against the Company are not resolved in a favorable manner to the Company, it could result in a material financial liability or damage to our reputation.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act may increase the Company\u2019s costs of operations which could adversely impact the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nThe goals of the Dodd-Frank Act include restoring public confidence in the financial system, preventing another financial crisis, and allowing regulators to identify failings in the system before another crisis can occur. As part of the reform, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, with oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which has broad regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services. The Dodd-Frank Act also changes the responsibilities of the current federal banking regulators, imposes additional corporate governance and disclosure requirements in areas such as executive compensation and proxy access, and limits or prohibits proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks. It also impacts areas such as deposit insurance, mortgage lending, capital requirements, securitizations, and insurance.\nThe scope of the Dodd-Frank Act impacts many aspects of the financial services industry and requires the development and adoption of numerous implementing regulations, many of which have yet to be finalized. Consequently, the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry and the Company will depend, in large part, upon the extent to which regulators exercise the authority granted to them and the approaches taken to implement the regulations. The Company continually assesses the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on its business and operations and believes that compliance with these new laws and regulations will likely result in higher costs, but the probable impact cannot be measured with a high degree of certainty. Compliance with the new laws and regulations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, any of which may impact the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 10913, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FFKT"}
