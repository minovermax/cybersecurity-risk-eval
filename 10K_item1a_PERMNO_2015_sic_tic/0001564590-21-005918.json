{"cik": "1735707", "company": "Garrett Motion Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and each of the risks described below, which we believe are the principal risks we face. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Chapter 11 Cases\nOur ability to successfully operate during and reorganize the Debtors in the Chapter 11 Cases is dependent upon our ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of the Debtors\u2019 motions, the outcome of Bankruptcy Court rulings and the progress of the Chapter 11 Cases in general, including the length of time the Debtors will operate in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nFor the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors are subject to the supervision of the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors\u2019 ability to continue to operate in the ordinary course, and for our ability to develop and execute our business plan, continue as a going concern and ultimately successfully reorganize the Debtors, are subject to:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions filed in the Chapter 11 Cases from time to time\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, confirm and consummate the Plan and the Transaction in the timeframe contemplated by RSA and the PSA or as otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to terminate contracts and other agreements with us\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee, or to convert the Chapter 11 Cases to a Chapter 7 proceeding\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans, and the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s rulings on such actions and decisions, as applicable.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business, operations, financial condition and our ultimate ability to successfully reorganize the Debtors in various ways. For example, negative events associated with the Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect the Debtors\u2019 or our non-debtor affiliates\u2019 relationships with suppliers, service providers, customers and other third parties, which in turn could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition. During the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors will need the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit the Debtors\u2019 ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of opportunities. Additionally, if creditors or other third parties raise significant objections or take other actions against the Debtors before the Bankruptcy Court, this could have the effect of significantly delaying our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan and the Transaction and, to the extent applicable, to meet the milestones set forth in the RSA and the PSA, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and our ultimate ability to successfully reorganize the Debtors. During the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as restructuring activities and expenses (including legal and other advisor costs), any contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact of events that occur during the Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans, or the ultimate length of time which the Chapter 11 Cases may continue.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases, the DIP Credit Agreement and the PSA limit the flexibility of our management team in running our business.\nOur Senior Secured Super-Priority Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time the \u201cDIP Credit Agreement\u201d) entered into in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, imposes a number of restrictions on the Debtors. Specifically, the Debtors are subject to certain affirmative covenants, including, without limitation, covenants requiring the Debtors to provide financial information, budgets and other information to the agent and the lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement, as well as negative covenants, including, without limitation, relating to the incurrence of additional debt, liens and the making of investments and restricted payments, in each case as set forth in the DIP Credit Agreement. Restrictions under the DIP Credit Agreement on the ability of our non-Debtor subsidiaries to incur debt, as well as on our ability to invest in our non-Debtor subsidiaries, and repay intercompany loans owing to our non-Debtor subsidiaries, could impact the availability of liquidity to our non-Debtor affiliates. The Debtors\u2019 ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control and our failure to comply or obtain a waiver in the event we cannot comply, with a covenant could result in an event of default under the DIP Credit Agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, continued compliance with or failure to obtain a waiver for covenants restricting the incurrence of debt by non-Debtor subsidiaries or the making of investments in, or the repayment of intercompany loans owing to, non-Debtor subsidiaries could limit the availability of liquidity to our non-Debtor affiliates, which could also adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to the restrictions applicable to the Debtors\u2019 in the Chapter 11 Cases, we are also subject to operating covenants that apply to the Debtors under PSA. These covenants generally require us to operate in the ordinary course of business, to refrain from taking certain enumerated actions and to affirmatively take other enumerated actions. Such covenants limit the flexibility of our management to respond to various events and circumstances that may arise from time to time, including as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain appropriate waivers from such covenants as may be necessary or advisable, which could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe may not be able to complete any Bankruptcy Court-approved reorganization of our Company or sales of our Company or assets through the chapter 11 process, or we may not be able to realize adequate consideration for such reorganization or sales, which would adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe Debtors\u2019 performance and obligations under the PSA and the ECBA are subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the Transaction is subject to other customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals or clearances. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain approval and complete the proposed reorganization, or any other significant reorganization transaction, including as a result of objections from our stakeholders. Such objections from stakeholders could result from stakeholders\u2019 preference for an alternative plan of reorganization than that contemplated by the PSA and the ECBA, such as the Atlantic Park Proposal (including with any subsequent modifications). If we are unable to complete a reorganization of the Company in the Chapter 11 Cases, including in accordance with the terms of the PSA and the ECBA, it may be necessary to seek additional funding sources, or convert from the Chapter 11 reorganization process to a Chapter 7 liquidation process. If one or more sales of the Company\u2019s assets are completed, they may not generate the anticipated or desired outcomes (including with respect to consideration received).\nFor more information on the PSA and the ECBA, see Note 2, Reorganization and Chapter 11 Proceedings of the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.\nThe resolution pursuant to the PSA of Honeywell\u2019s claims against our bankruptcy estates and our litigation with Honeywell requires approval of the Bankruptcy Court.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into certain agreements with Honeywell, including the Indemnity Agreements and the Tax Matters Agreement, which have given rise to significant claims by Honeywell against our bankruptcy estates and have led to litigation between us and Honeywell.\nUnder the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement, we are required to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90% of Honeywell\u2019s asbestos-related liability payments and accounts payable, primarily related to Honeywell\u2019s legacy Bendix friction materials (\u201cBendix\u201d) business in the United States as well as certain environmental-related liability payments and accounts payable and non-United States asbestos-related liability payments and accounts payable, in each case related to legacy elements of our business, including the legal costs of defending and resolving such liabilities, less 90% of Honeywell\u2019s net insurance receipts and, as may be applicable, certain other recoveries associated with such liabilities. The amount payable by us in respect of such liabilities arising in any given year will be payable in Euros, subject to a cap (denominated in Euros) equal to $175 million, calculated by reference to the Distribution Date Currency Exchange Rate. The cap is exclusive of any late payment fees up to 5% per annum.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement contains covenants and indemnification obligations that address compliance with Section 355 of the Code, are intended to preserve the tax-free nature of the Spin-Off, and outline Honeywell\u2019s and our post-spin rights, responsibilities, and obligations regarding tax-related matters (including tax liabilities, tax attributes, tax returns and tax contests). The Tax Matters Agreement provides, among other things, that, following the Spin-Off date of October 1, 2018, we are responsible and will indemnify Honeywell for all taxes, including income taxes, sales taxes, value-added and payroll taxes, relating to Garrett for all periods, including periods prior to the completion date of the Spin-Off. Additionally, the Tax Matters Agreement provides that Garrett ASASCO is to make payments to a subsidiary of Honeywell for a portion of Honeywell\u2019s net tax liability under Section 965(h)(6)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code for mandatory transition taxes that Honeywell determined is attributable to us (the \u201cMTT Claim\u201d).\nIn December 2019, we commenced a lawsuit against Honeywell in connection with the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement for declaratory judgment, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duties, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duties, corporate waste, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment. Our lawsuit seeks, among other things, to establish that the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement is unenforceable in whole or in part because Honeywell has failed to establish the prerequisites for indemnification under New York law, and improperly seeks indemnification for amounts attributable to punitive damages and intentional misconduct. Following the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors removed the lawsuit against Honeywell to the Bankruptcy Court and also initiated litigation against Honeywell regarding the value and validity of its claims under the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement.\nUnder the terms of the PSA and the Transaction, the Plan, if confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, will include a global settlement with Honeywell providing for (a) the full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of all liabilities under or related to the Indemnity Agreements and the Tax Matters Agreement and (b) the dismissal with prejudice of the Honeywell Litigation in exchange for (x) a $375 million cash payment at Emergence and (y) the Series B Preferred Stock. The Company will have the option to prepay the Series B Preferred Stock in full at any time at a call price equivalent to $584 million as of Emergence (representing the present value of the installments at a 7.25% discount rate). The Company will also have the option to make a partial payment of the Series B Preferred Stock, reducing the present value to $400 million, at any time within 18 months of Emergence. In every case the duration of future liabilities to Honeywell will be reduced from 30 years prior to the Chapter 11 filing to a maximum of nine years.\nOur entry into and performance under the PSA and the terms of the PSA, the Transaction and the Plan remain subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court. There can be no assurances that we will obtain the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and consummate the Transaction.\nFor more information on the risks related to the approval of the Plan, see \u201cWe may not be able to complete any Bankruptcy Court-approved reorganization of our Company or sales of our Company or assets through the chapter 11 process, or we may not be able to realize adequate consideration for such reorganization or sales, which would adversely affect our financial condition\u201d.\nOperating under Bankruptcy Court protection for a long period of time may harm our business.\nA long period of operations under Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, our senior management may be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. A prolonged period of operating under Bankruptcy Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, as the length of the Chapter 11 Cases increases, the risk that customers and suppliers will lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully may also increase, and such customers and suppliers may seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nDelay of the Chapter 11 Cases could impact our ability to maintain our operations during the Chapter 11 Cases.\nIf the Chapter 11 Cases take longer than expected to conclude, the Debtors may exhaust or lose access to the DIP Term Loan Facility. Any of these factors could result in the need for substantial additional funding. A number of other factors, including the Chapter 11 Cases, our recent financial results, our substantial indebtedness and the competitive environment we face, may adversely affect the availability and terms of funding that might be available to us during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. As such, we may not be able to source capital at rates acceptable to us, or at all, to fund our current operations. The inability to obtain necessary additional funding on acceptable terms could have a material adverse impact on us and on our ability to sustain our operations during the Chapter 11 Cases.\nOur ability to prosecute the Chapter 11 Cases and obtain confirmation of the Plan may be contested by third parties with litigation.\nCertain of the Debtors\u2019 creditors and other parties-in-interest may object to and commence litigation against the Debtors during the course of the Chapter 11 Cases, the outcome of which is uncertain. Such litigation may prolong the Chapter 11 Cases and may make it difficult for the Debtors to reach the contractual milestones for the case within the timeframes set out in each of the PSA and RSA.\nIn certain instances, a Chapter 11 proceeding may be converted to a proceeding under Chapter 7.\nThere can be no assurance as to whether the Debtors will successfully reorganize under the Chapter 11 Cases. If the Bankruptcy Court finds that it would be in the best interest of creditors and/or the Debtors, the Bankruptcy Court may convert the Chapter 11 Cases to proceedings under Chapter 7. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate the Debtors\u2019 assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to the Debtors\u2019 creditors than those provided for in a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a disorderly fashion over a short period of time rather than reorganizing or selling in a controlled manner the Debtors\u2019 businesses as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nTrading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases poses substantial risks.\nWhile the proposed terms of the Transaction under the PSA contemplate the reinstatement or cash-out of the Company\u2019s stockholders, such terms remain subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the Company\u2019s stockholders are cautioned that it is possible that the Company\u2019s stockholders will receive nothing in exchange for their common stock upon the completion of the Chapter 11 Cases and that the common stock will have no value and that trading in securities of the Company during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases will be highly speculative and will pose substantial risks. The delisting of our common stock from New York Stock Exchange has limited and could continue to limit the liquidity of our common stock, increase the volatility in the price of our common stock, and hinder our ability to raise capital. If the Plan is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is possible the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock may be cancelled and extinguished upon confirmation of a different plan of reorganization by the Bankruptcy Court. In such an event, the Company\u2019s stockholders may be entitled to receive recovery on account of their equity interests, but the amount of any such recovery is highly uncertain and there may be no such recovery. Trading prices for the Company\u2019s common stock and other securities may bear little or no relation to actual recovery, if any, by holders thereof in the Company\u2019s Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, the Company urges extreme caution with respect to existing and future investments in its securities.\nOur common stock was delisted from NYSE and is currently traded on the OTC Pink Sheets market maintained by the OTC Market Group, Inc., which involves additional risks compared to being listed on a national securities exchange.\nTrading in our common stock was suspended on September 21, 2020 and removed from listing on NYSE on October 19, 2020. We will not be able to relist our common stock on a national securities exchange during our Chapter 11 process, although our common stock is now quoted on the OTC Pink Sheets market maintained by the OTC Market Group, Inc. under the trading symbol \u201cGTXMQ\u201d. We may be unable to relist our common stock on a national securities exchange after our Emergence. The lack of listing on a national securities exchange may impair the ability of holders of our common stock to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable. The lack of listing on a national securities exchange may also reduce the fair market value of the shares of our common stock. Furthermore, because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock, the price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the markets\u2019 perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors, parties with whom we have business relationships or third parties with interests in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nIndustry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the continued growth, viability and financial stability of our customers. A substantial portion of our customers are OEMs in the automotive industry. This industry is subject to rapid technological change often driven by regulatory changes, vigorous competition, short product life cycles and cyclical and reduced consumer demand patterns. In addition to general economic conditions, automotive sales and automotive vehicle production also depend on other factors, such as supplier stability, factory transitions, capacity constraints, the costs and availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer preferences. When our customers are adversely affected by these factors, we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products. Economic declines and corresponding reductions in automotive sales and production by our customers, particularly with respect to light vehicles, have in the past had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEven if overall automotive sales and production remain stable, changes in regulations and consumer preferences may shift consumer demand away from the types of vehicles we prioritize or towards the types of vehicles where our products generate smaller profit margins. A decrease in consumer demand for the specific types of vehicles that have traditionally included our turbocharger products, such as a decrease in demand for diesel-fueled vehicles in favor of gasoline-fueled vehicles, or lower-than-expected consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we anticipate providing significant components as part of our strategic growth plan, such as a decrease in demand for vehicles utilizing electric-hybrid and fuel cell powertrains in favor of full battery electric vehicles, could have a significant effect on our business. If we are unable to anticipate significant changes in consumer sentiment, or if consumer demand for certain vehicle types changes more than we expect, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nSales in our aftermarket operations are also directly related to consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products, which may be affected by additional factors such as the average useful life of OEM parts and components, severity of regional weather conditions, highway and roadway infrastructure deterioration and the average number of miles vehicles are driven by owners. Improvements in technology and product quality are extending the longevity of vehicle component parts, which may result in delayed or reduced aftermarket sales. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we fail to respond in a timely and appropriate manner to changes in the demand for our aftermarket products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is expected to further adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nDuring 2020, the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, spread across the world, including throughout Asia, the United States and Europe. The outbreak and government measures taken in response had and continue to have a significant adverse impact, both direct and indirect, on our businesses and the economy. Our manufacturing facility in Wuhan, China was shut down for six weeks in February and March 2020 and we saw diminished production in our Shanghai, China facility for that same time period, which were the primary drivers of the decrease in sales in the Asia region during the three months ended March 31, 2020. While our facilities in China re-opened in the second quarter, our manufacturing facilities in Mexicali, Mexico and Pune, India were shut down and our manufacturing facilities in Europe operated at reduced capacity. This significantly reduced our production volumes and had a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the third quarter, the fast recovery observed in all geographies enabled us to ramp up production in most of our production sites to normal levels. This recovery continued in the fourth quarter with a very strong demand especially in China and Europe. However, if the COVID-19 pandemic drives new lockdown measures impacting our manufacturing facilities, our facilities may be forced to shut down or operate at reduced capacity again which will continue to negatively impact our revenues. We have also faced limitations on our employee resources, including because of stay-at-home orders from local governments, new Paid Time Off policies, employee furloughs, state-funded layoffs, sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people. The pandemic has also diverted management resources and the prolonged work-from-home arrangements have created business continuity and cybersecurity risks.\nCertain of our customers have been similarly affected and are experiencing closures and labor shortages. As a result of such closures, we have experienced weakened demand from our customers, who have not been able to accept orders or have delayed or canceled orders, which has negatively affected our revenues. If this trend continues, our revenues will continue to be negatively impacted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the outbreak impacts our business, liquidity and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the availability and effectiveness of any vaccines or treatments, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the European Union, China and other countries, the duration and extent of business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain the disease. If we or our customers experience prolonged shutdowns or other business disruptions beyond current expectations, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and within planned timelines could be materially and adversely impacted, and our business and financial results may continue to be adversely affected.\nOur leveraged capital structure and liabilities to Honeywell may pose significant challenges to our overall strategic and financial flexibility and have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position and financial position.\nOur leverage ratio remains high and, unless addressed in the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect that it will remain so for at least the next several quarters.\nThis high leverage is exacerbated by Garrett ASASCO\u2019s purported significant liabilities and obligations to Honeywell under the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement and the tax matters agreement with Honeywell, dated September 12, 2018 (the \u201cTax Matters Agreement\u201d). Under the terms of the PSA and the Transaction, the Plan, if confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, will include a global settlement with Honeywell providing for (a) the full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of all liabilities under or related to the Indemnity Agreements and the Tax Matters Agreement and (b) the dismissal with prejudice of the Honeywell Litigation in exchange for (x) a $375 million cash payment at Emergence and (y) the Series B Preferred Stock. The terms of the PSA, the Transaction and the Plan remain subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court. There can be no assurances that we will obtain the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and consummate the Transaction.\nOur current leveraged capital structure poses significant challenges to our overall strategic and financial flexibility and may impair our ability to gain or hold market share in the highly competitive automotive supply market. This leverage may be greater than that of some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, our business has been and may continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related response measures, which has had adverse consequences for our leverage. See \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is expected to further adversely impact our business and results of operations.\u201d above for more information. The COVID-19 pandemic and related response measures may continue to have an impact, and if we are unable to manage through these challenges, our leverage ratio, capital structure or liquidity may be further adversely effected. On September 20, 2020, the Debtors filed the Chapter 11 Cases in order to address this leveraged capital structure. However, because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact of events that occur during the Chapter 11 Cases on our leverage, capital structure, liabilities or liquidity position, and we may not be successful in addressing these challenges through or following the Chapter 11 Cases. See risks related to the Chapter 11 Cases above for more information.\nChanges in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on demand for our products and our results of operations.\nThe sales and margins of our business are directly impacted by government regulations, including safety, performance and product certification regulations, particularly with respect to emissions, fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. While such requirements can promote increased demand for our turbochargers and other products, several markets in which we operate are undertaking efforts to more strictly regulate or ban vehicles powered by certain older-generation diesel engines. If such efforts are pursued more broadly throughout the market than we have anticipated, such efforts may impact demand for our aftermarket products and consequently affect our results of operations.\nIn the long-term, several of the markets in which we operate are contemplating or undertaking multi-decade efforts to transition away from internal combustion engines in favor of hybrid or full-battery electric vehicles.\nAlthough we expect a significant number of hybrids will be turbocharged, if we overestimate the turbo penetration rate in hybrids or if a transition to battery-electric vehicles is pursued more broadly throughout the market, or is implemented more rapidly than we have anticipated, the demand for our products could be impacted and our results of operations consequently could be affected. This is a risk existing in particular in Europe. In the US, with the change in presidential administration, we expect to see a move to adoption of new environmental regulations, which presents similar risks as in Europe in the long-term, depending on how regulatory targets for fuel efficiency and emissions in the 2025-30 timeframe will be set.\nOur future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products with acceptable margins that achieve market acceptance or correctly anticipate regulatory changes.\nThe global automotive component supply industry is highly competitive. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to: (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; (ii) develop and maintain competitive products; (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors; (iv) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost effectively; and (v) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers\u2019 needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products.\nWe have identified a trend towards increased development and adoption by OEMs of hybrid-electric powertrains, fuel cell powertrains and associated electric boosting technologies, especially on commercial vehicle applications, as pure battery-electric vehicles continue to face range, charging time and sustainability issues on those applications. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if our estimates regarding adoption and penetration rates for hybrid-electric and fuel cell powertrains or for pure battery electric cars are incorrect.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property of others could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, tradenames, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available, or we may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate registered or unregistered intellectual property, in every country in which we do business. Furthermore, in some areas of our business the established industry maturity of product technology may leave limited opportunity for new intellectual property to differentiate our products. Accordingly, our intellectual property may not be sufficient on its own to provide us a strong product differentiation and competitive advantage, which in turn could weaken our ability to secure business awards from our customers and/or our ability to achieve targeted product profitability.\nThe protection of our intellectual property may require us to spend significant amounts of money. Further, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent others from infringing, violating or misappropriating our intellectual proprietary rights. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights, including due to changes in U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures, could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nInternational technical export control regulations and trade conflicts may limit our ability to use certain intellectual property in our products in some regions of the world or customers may require assured access to intellectual property through open source-code, joint ownership of intellectual property, free license, or other measures. These constraints could cause us difficulty in securing business awards from our customers, protecting our competitive technology differentiation, and/or our ability to achieve targeted product profitability.\nIn addition, as we adopt new technology, we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights. Successful claims that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or cause us to incur substantial monetary liability. We may also be prohibited preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or be required to change our business practices to stop the infringing use, which could limit our ability to compete effectively. In addition, our customer agreements may require us to indemnify the customer for infringement. The time and expense of defending against these claims, whether meritorious or not, may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability, can be time-consuming and costly and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our businesses. Furthermore, the publicity we may receive as a result of infringing intellectual property rights may damage our reputation and adversely impact our existing customer relationships and our ability to develop new business.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims, including product recalls, and product liability actions that may be brought against us.\nDepending on the terms under which we supply products to an auto manufacturer, we may be required to guarantee or offer warranties for our products and to bear the costs of recalls, repair or replacement of such products pursuant to new vehicle warranties. There can be no assurance that we will have adequate reserves to cover such recall, repair and replacement costs. In the event that any of our products fails to perform as expected, we may face direct exposure to warranty and product liability claims or may be required to participate in a government or self-imposed recall involving such products. Our customers that are not end users, such as auto manufacturers, may face similar claims or be obliged to conduct recalls of their own, and in such circumstances, they may seek contribution from us. Our agreements with our customers do not always include limitation of liability clauses or, in certain situations or legal jurisdictions, such limitation of liability clauses may not be fully valid. If any such claims or contribution requests exceed our available insurance, or if there is a product recall, there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, a recall claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other product lines, which could result in significant disruption to our business and could have a further adverse impact on our results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will not experience any material warranty or product liability claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims.\nThe operational constraints and financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our third-party suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. If our third-party manufacturers fail to deliver products, parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders on similar terms or at all, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. See \u201cRaw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.\u201d If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness and operational reliability of existing or future suppliers, if there is any unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and operational reliability, or if our suppliers do not perform or adhere to our existing or future contractual arrangements, any resulting increase in nonperformance by them, our inability to otherwise obtain the supplies or our inability to enforce the terms of the contract or seek other remedies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWork stoppages, other disruptions, or the need to relocate any of our facilities could significantly disrupt our business.\nOur geographic footprint emphasizes locating, engineering and manufacturing capabilities in close physical proximity to our customers, thereby enabling us to adopt technologies and products for the specific vehicle types sold in each geographic market. Because our facilities offer localized services in this manner, a work stoppage or other disruption at one or more of our R&D, engineering or manufacturing and assembly facilities in a given region could have material adverse effects on our business, especially insofar as it impacts our ability to serve customers in that region. For example, our manufacturing facility in Wuhan, China was shut down in 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, causing us to delay certain shipments to our customers. Moreover, due to unforeseen circumstances or factors beyond our control, we may be forced to relocate our operations from one or more of our existing facilities to new facilities and may incur substantial costs, experience program delays and sacrifice proximity to customers and geographic markets as a result, potentially for an extended period of time.\nThe automotive industry relies heavily on \u201cjust-in-time\u201d delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of vehicles, and when we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations, we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the \u201croot cause\u201d problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products. We typically must also carry the costs associated with \u201ccatching up,\u201d such as overtime and premium freight. Additionally, if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us. These losses and expenses could be significant, and may include consequential losses such as lost profits.\nIn addition, a significant disruption in the supply of a key component due to a work stoppage or other disruption at one of our suppliers or any other supplier could impact our ability to make timely deliveries to our customers and, accordingly, have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time, or as a result of a work stoppage or other disruption, it is unlikely we will be fully compensated, if at all.\nWe may not realize sales represented by awarded business or effectively utilize our manufacturing capacity.\nWhen we win a bid to offer products and services to an OEM customer, the customer typically does not commit to award us its business until a separate contract has been negotiated, generally with a term ranging from one year to the life of the model (usually three to seven years). Once business has been awarded, the OEM customer typically retains the ability to terminate the arrangement without penalty and does not commit to purchase a minimum volume of products while the contract is in effect.\nIn light of the foregoing, while we estimate awarded business using certain assumptions, including projected future sales volumes, the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to: variation in demand for our customers\u2019 products; our customers\u2019 attempts to manage their inventory; design changes; changes in our customers\u2019 manufacturing strategy; the success of customers\u2019 goods and models; and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers. A significant decrease in demand for certain key models or a group of related models sold by any of our major customers, or the ability of a manufacturer to re-source and discontinue purchasing from us its requirements for a particular model or group of models, could have a material adverse effect on us. In particular, we may be unable to forecast the level of customer orders with sufficient certainty to allow us to optimize production schedules and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity. Any excess capacity would cause us to incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly during economic downturns. Similarly, a significant failure or inability to adapt to increased production or desired inventory levels (including as a result of accelerated launch schedules for new automobile and truck platforms), comply with customer specifications and manufacturing requirements more generally or respond to other unexpected fluctuations, as well as any delays or other problems with existing or new products (including program launch difficulties) could result in financial penalties, increased costs, loss of sales, loss of customers or potential breaches of customer contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nIf actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business, or if we are unable to improve utilization levels for manufacturing lines that consequently are underutilized and correctly manage capacity, the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate.\nWe may not be able to successfully negotiate pricing terms with our customers, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe negotiate sales prices annually with our automotive customers. Our customer supply agreements generally require step-downs in component pricing over the period of production. In addition, our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts at any time, which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions. OEMs have also exercised significant influence over their suppliers, including us, because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive and serves a limited number of customers. Based on these factors, our status as a Tier I supplier (one that supplies vehicle components directly to manufacturers) and the fact that our customers\u2019 product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes, our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing, and any cost-cutting initiatives that our customers adopt generally will result in increased downward pressure on our pricing. Any resulting impacts to our sales levels and margins, or the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors, could over time significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. In particular, large commercial settlements with our customers may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.\nWe have created a geographic footprint that emphasizes locating R&D, engineering and manufacturing capabilities in close physical proximity to our customers. Our international geographic footprint subjects us to many risks, including: exchange control regulations; wage and price controls; antitrust and environmental regulations; employment regulations; foreign investment laws; monetary and fiscal policies and protectionist measures that may prohibit acquisitions or joint ventures, establish local content requirements, or impact trade volumes; import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes); violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws; changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises; nationalization of private enterprises; natural and man-made disasters, hazards and losses; global health risks and pandemics; backlash from foreign labor organizations related to our restructuring actions; violence, civil and labor unrest; acts of terrorism; and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Additionally, certain of the markets in which we operate have adopted increasingly strict data privacy and data protection requirements or may require local storage and processing of data or similar requirements. The European Commission has approved a data protection regulation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), that came into force in May 2018. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The GDPR and similar data protection measures may increase the cost and complexity of our ability to deliver our services.\nFollowing the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the U.K. entered into a transition period during which it continued its ongoing and complex negotiations with the European Union relating to the future trading relationship between the U.K. and European Union. The transition period ended on December 31, 2020, before which the United Kingdom and the European Commission reached an agreement on the future trading relationship between the parties (the \u201cUK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement\u201d OR \u201cTCA\u201d). On December 30, 2020 the U.K. Parliament approved the European (Future Relationship) Bill, thereby ratifying the TCA. The TCA is subject to formal approval by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union before it comes into effect and has been applied provisionally since January 1, 2021. Significant political and economic uncertainty remains about whether the terms of the relationship will differ materially from the terms before withdrawal. Our manufacturing operations in Cheadle and the businesses of our customers and suppliers could be negatively impacted if tariffs or other restrictions are imposed on the free flow of goods to and from the U.K. Trade tensions between the United States and China, and other countries have escalated in recent years. Any U.S. tariff impositions against Chinese exports have generally been followed by retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports to China. We may not be able to mitigate the impacts of any future tariffs, and our business, results of operations and financial position would be materially adversely affected by such tariffs. Further changes in U.S. trade policies, tariffs, taxes, export restrictions or other trade barriers, or restrictions on raw materials or components may limit our ability to produce products, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease our profit margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase raw materials or components, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These and other instabilities and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, along with the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.\nAs a result of our global presence, a significant portion of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar whereas a significant amount of our payment obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars, which exposes us to foreign exchange risk. We monitor and seek to reduce such risk through hedging activities; however, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility.\nFinally, we generate significant amounts of cash that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose us to financial loss.\nWe have invested substantial resources in specific foreign markets where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized.\nWe have identified certain countries, such as China and India, as key high-growth geographic markets. We believe these markets are likely to experience substantial long-term growth, and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in numerous manufacturing operations, technical centers, R&D activities and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in these areas. If market demand for evolving vehicle technologies in these regions does not grow as quickly as we anticipate, or if we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in these regions, we may fail to realize expected rates of return, or even incur losses, on our\nexisting investments and may be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets or product categories, potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors. In particular, our ability to remain competitive and continue to grow in these regions depends in part on the absence of competing state-sponsored domestic businesses. If a state-sponsored operation entered a local market as a competitor, it might have access to significant social and financial capital that would enable it to overcome the ordinary barriers to entry in the turbocharger industry and acquire potentially significant market share at our expense.\nWe could be adversely affected by our leading market position in certain markets.\nWe believe that we are a market leader in the turbocharger industry in many of the markets in which we operate. Although we believe we have acted properly in the markets in which we have significant market share, we could face allegations of abuse of our market position or of collusion with other market participants, which could result in negative publicity and adverse regulatory action by the relevant authorities, including the imposition of monetary fines, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA deterioration in industry, economic or financial conditions may restrict our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms.\nWe may require additional capital in the future to finance our growth and development, upgrade and improve our manufacturing capabilities, implement further marketing and sales activities, fund ongoing R&D activities, satisfy regulatory and environmental compliance obligations, satisfy indemnity obligations to Honeywell, and meet general working capital needs. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including acceptance of and demand for our products, the extent to which we invest in new technology and R&D projects and the status and timing of these developments. If our access to capital were to become constrained significantly, or if costs of capital increased significantly, due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, the solvency of our customers, a material decline in demand for our products, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. These conditions may adversely affect our ability to obtain targeted credit ratings.\nWe may need additional capital resources in the future in order to meet our projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, and if we are unable to obtain sufficient resources for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRaw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.\nThe cost and availability of raw materials (including, but not limited to, grey iron, aluminum, stainless steel and a nickel, iron and chromium-based alloy) is a key element in the cost of our products. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe obtain components and other products and services from numerous suppliers and other vendors throughout the world. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a single- or sole-source basis. Although we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Short- or long-term capacity constraints or financial distress at any point in our supply chain could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial performance, particularly when the affected suppliers and vendors are the sole sources of products that we require or that have unique capabilities, or when our customers have directed us to use those specific suppliers and vendors. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers\u2019 inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial contracts, and could result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.\nFailure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our business.\nOur profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions, workforce reductions, asset impairments, product line rationalizations and other cost-saving initiatives. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, attrition, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.\nOur operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.\nWe are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the investigation and cleanup of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may arise from hazardous substance releases and exposures. We are also subject to potentially material liabilities related to the compliance of our operations with the requirements of various federal, state, local and foreign governments that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of and exposure to hazardous substances. If we are found to be in violation of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to substantial fines and criminal sanctions and be required to install costly equipment or make operational changes to achieve compliance with such laws and regulations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations or government enforcement of policies concerning the environment, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new information related to individual contaminated sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques, could require us to incur additional currently unanticipated costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.\nWe are or may be party to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of our current and historical business, including matters relating to our Honeywell Indemnity Agreement, commercial transactions, product liability (including legacy asbestos claims involving the friction materials legacy business), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters, as well as securities litigation, tax proceedings and litigation related to our debt. For additional information regarding our pending legal proceedings, see Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of legal proceedings or contingencies. The costs incurred in litigation can be substantial and result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe may also make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses, and issue guarantees of third-party obligations. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. If we were required to make payments, such payments could be significant and could exceed the amounts we have accrued with respect thereto, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the complex nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key engineering personnel, scientists and executive officers, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. The loss of key employees, our inability to attract new qualified employees or adequately train employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of our future earnings which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to address base erosion and profit shifting, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes.\nBecause we have officers and directors who live outside of the United States, you may have no effective recourse against them for misconduct and may not be able to receive compensation for damages to the value of your investment caused by wrongful actions by our directors and officers.\nWe have officers and directors who live outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the U.S. any judgments obtained against those officers and directors or obtain judgments against them outside of the U.S. that are based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the U.S. Investors may not be able to receive compensation for damages to the value of their investment caused by wrongful actions by our directors and officers.\nOur emerging opportunities in technology, products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties.\nA number of our emerging opportunities in technology, products and services rely on key technologies developed or licensed from third parties. While the majority of our current product offerings are not covered by third-party licenses, many of our emerging technology offerings that we are developing use software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, including both through proprietary and open source licenses. Should such emerging products become a significant part of our product offerings, our reliance on third-party licenses may present various risks to our business. These third-party software components may become obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our emerging technology offerings, our relationship with these third parties may deteriorate, or our agreements with these third parties may expire or be terminated. We may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must carefully monitor and manage our use of third-party components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms. Additionally, some of these licenses may not be available for use in the future on terms that may be acceptable or that allow our emerging product offerings to remain competitive. Our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our emerging technology offerings. Moreover, it is possible that as a consequence of a future merger or acquisition we may be involved in, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction. Because the availability and cost from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license our competitors will either refuse to license us at all, or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to obtain these rights.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-Off and our Separation from Honeywell\nIf the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could have an indemnification obligation to Honeywell, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf, as a result of any of our representations being untrue or our covenants being breached, the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, we could be required to indemnify Honeywell for the resulting taxes and related expenses. Further, if any pre-spin restructuring activities that were initiated by Honeywell were determined to be taxable and benefit the Company, we could be required to indemnify Honeywell. Those amounts could be material. Any such indemnification obligation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, if we or our stockholders were to engage in transactions that resulted in a 50% or greater change by vote or value in the ownership of our stock during the four-year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the date of the Distribution, the Spin-Off would generally be taxable to Honeywell, but not to stockholders, under Section 355(e), unless it were established that such transactions and the Spin-Off were not part of a plan or series of related transactions. If the Spin-Off were taxable to Honeywell due to such a 50% or greater change in ownership of our stock, Honeywell would recognize gain equal to the excess of the fair market value on the Distribution Date of our common stock distributed to Honeywell stockholders over Honeywell\u2019s tax basis in our common stock, and we generally would be required to indemnify Honeywell for the tax on such gain and related expenses. Those amounts would be material. Any such indemnification obligation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the terms of the PSA and the Transaction, the Plan, if confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, will include a global settlement with Honeywell providing for (a) the full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of all liabilities under or related to the Indemnity Agreements and the Tax Matters Agreement and (b) the dismissal with prejudice of the Honeywell Litigation in exchange for (x) a $375 million cash payment at Emergence and (y) the Series B Preferred Stock. The terms of the PSA, the Transaction and the Plan remain subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court. There can be no assurances that we will obtain the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and consummate the Transaction.\nFor more information on the risks related to the approval of the Plan, see \u201cWe may not be able to complete any Bankruptcy Court-approved reorganization of our Company or sales of our Company or assets through the chapter 11 process, or we may not be able to realize adequate consideration for such reorganization or sales, which would adversely affect our financial condition\u201d.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we incurred substantial indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1,660 million, of which $1,628 million of the net proceeds were transferred to Honeywell substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Spin-Off. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, we incurred an additional indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of $200 million.\nWe historically relied upon Honeywell to fund our working capital requirements and other cash requirements. We are now responsible for servicing our own debt and obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital and other funds to satisfy our cash requirements. Due to our separation from Honeywell and the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases our access to and cost of debt financing will be different from our historical access to and cost of debt financing. Differences in access to and cost of debt financing may result in differences in the interest rate charged to us on financings, as well as the amount of indebtedness, types of financing structures and debt markets that may be available to us.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the debt incurred in connection with the Spin-Off and the Chapter 11 Cases, as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nThe terms of our indebtedness restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to incur debt that we may need to fund initiatives in response to changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, the economy and governmental regulations.\nThe terms of our Prepetition Credit Agreement and DIP Credit Agreement include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests. These may restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take some or all of the following actions:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or sell disqualified or preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, make distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting the ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nprepay, repurchase or redeem certain kinds of indebtedness;\n\u2022\nissue or sell stock of our subsidiaries; and/or\n\u2022\nsignificantly change the nature of our business.\nMoreover, as a result of all of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business and pursue our strategy, unable to raise additional debt financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. Furthermore, the lenders of this indebtedness have required that we pledge our assets as security for our repayment obligations and that we abide by certain financial or operational covenants. Our ability to comply with such covenants and restrictions has been and may continue to be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, political, social, financial and industry conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default that accelerated our obligations and terminated undrawn commitments, as applicable, under the Prepetition Credit Agreement. The Prepetition Credit Agreement provides that as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the principal, interest and all other amounts due thereunder shall be immediately due and payable. Any efforts to enforce the payment obligations under the Prepetition Credit Agreement are automatically stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, and the creditors\u2019 rights of enforcement in respect of the Prepetition Credit Agreement are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUnder the DIP Credit Agreement, a breach of any of the covenants listed above, if applicable, could result in an event of default. If an event of default occurred, the lenders under our DIP Credit Agreement would have the right to accelerate the repayment of such debt. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments, and lenders could then proceed against any collateral. Any subsequent replacement of the agreements governing such indebtedness, or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions. The occurrence and ramifications of an event of default could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have potential business conflicts of interest with Honeywell with respect to our past and ongoing relationships.\nConflicts of interest may arise between Honeywell and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including:\n\u2022\nlabor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our separation from Honeywell;\n\u2022\nintellectual property matters;\n\u2022\nemployee recruiting and retention; and\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations involving our company (including, without limitation, the Transaction).\nThe Chapter 11 Cases may exacerbate any potential conflicts and make resolution of any potential conflicts more difficult to achieve outside of the Bankruptcy Court. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with a party with whom we were not previously affiliated.\nCertain of our directors and employees may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their financial interests in Honeywell.\nBecause of their former positions with Honeywell, certain of our executive officers and directors own equity interests in Honeywell. Continuing ownership of Honeywell shares could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if we and Honeywell face decisions that could have implications for both us and Honeywell.\nThe allocation of intellectual property rights between Honeywell and us as part of the Spin-Off, and our shared use of certain intellectual property rights, could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into agreements with Honeywell governing the allocation of intellectual property rights related to our business. These agreements could adversely affect our position and options relating to intellectual property enforcement, licensing negotiations and monetization. We also may not have sufficient rights to grant sublicenses of intellectual property used in our business. These circumstances could adversely affect our ability to protect our competitive position in the industry.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be available, and our stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe Chapter 11 Cases, including the approval by the Bankruptcy Court of entry into the PSA and the ECBA, the terms of the Transaction and confirmation of the Plan;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategies;\n\u2022\ncompetition and industry capacity;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and other factors that affect earnings and cash flow;\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness, our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness and our ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover, or positively cover, our common stock after the Spin-Off;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our company and our industry;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance;\n\u2022\nresults from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations (including tax laws and regulations) affecting our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nLow trading volume for our stock, which may occur if an active trading market is not available, among other reasons, would amplify the effect of the above factors on our stock price volatility. The delisting of our common stock from New York Stock Exchange has limited and could continue to limit the liquidity of our common stock, increase the volatility in the price of our common stock, and hinder our ability to raise capital.\nShould the market price of our stock drop significantly, stockholders may institute securities class action lawsuits against us. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources.\nCertain provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws and Delaware law may discourage takeovers.\nSeveral provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-Laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition. These include, among others, provisions that:\n\u2022\nprovide for staggered terms for directors on our Board for a period following the Spin-Off;\n\u2022\ndo not permit our stockholders to act by written consent and require that stockholder action must take place at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders, in each case except as such rights may otherwise be provided to holders of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations and proposals;\n\u2022\nlimit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to enter into business combination transactions.\nThese and other provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-Laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of Garrett, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price.\nUnder the terms of the Transaction under the PSA, the Plan, if confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, may result in the removal or alteration of some or all of these provisions, subject to negotiation of definitive corporate governance documentation with the CO Group. There can be no assurances that any definitive corporate governance documentation with the CO Group will not continue to discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of Garrett, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation designates the courts of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery located within the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Garrett, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or stockholders to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporate Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery located in the State of Delaware or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or any other action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim\u201d as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL. However, if the Court of Chancery within the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, the action may be brought in any other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. This provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nSystem or service failures, including as a result of cyber or other security incidents, could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nWe deploy and maintain IT and engineering systems. Our systems involve sensitive information and may be conducted in hazardous environments. As a result, we are subject to systems or service failures, not only resulting from our failures or the failures of third-party service providers, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks, but also from exposure to cyber or other security threats. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, our products, our customers and/or our third-party service providers, including cloud providers. There has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of cyber and other security threats we face, and our customers are increasingly requiring cyber and other security protections and mandating cyber and other security standards in our products.\nCyber and other security incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Moreover, employee error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other intentional or inadvertent non-compliance with our security protocols may result in a breach of our information systems. Cyber and other security incidents aimed at the software embedded in our products could lead to third-party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products.\nThe potential consequences of a material cyber or other security incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the United States Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cyber and other security protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. In addition to any costs resulting from contract performance or required corrective action, these incidents could generate increased costs or loss of revenue if our customers choose to postpone or cancel previously scheduled orders or decide not to renew any of our existing contracts.\nThe costs related to cyber or other security incidents may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. The successful assertion of a large claim against us with respect to a cyber or other security incident could seriously harm our business. Even if not successful, these claims could result in significant legal and other costs, may be a distraction to our management and harm our customer relationships, as well as our reputation.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and investors\u2019 views of us could be harmed.\nWe are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, the market price of shares of common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nOur ability to successfully comply with Section 404 requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, may cause our operations to suffer, and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, and our independent registered public accounting firm may provide an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting. In the course of preparing our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, our management determined that there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to the supporting evidence for our liability to Honeywell under the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement that has since been remediated. Even though we have concluded, and our auditors have concurred, that that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020, we could identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, which could cause us to have to restate our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. In the event of an additional material weakness or restatement, the market price of shares of common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances pursuant to the Plan, if confirmed, for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we may grant to our directors, officers and other employees. Our Board has adopted and Honeywell, as our sole shareholder, approved, the 2018 Stock Incentive Plan of Garrett and its Affiliates (the \u201cEquity Plan\u201d) for the benefit of certain of our current and future employees and other service providers. Our non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the 2018 Stock Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Awards made under such plans will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nUnder the terms of the Transaction, if approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the CO Group and certain of our existing stockholders will be issued Series A Preferred Stock which will be convertible in certain circumstances into shares of common stock. Any such conversion may significantly dilute the percentage ownership of our current stockholders.\nIn addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may generally determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of the members of our board of directors in all events or upon the happening of specified events, or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nFrom time-to-time, we may opportunistically evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities, including acquisitions for which the consideration thereof may consist partially or entirely of newly-issued shares of our common stock and, therefore, such transactions, if consummated, would dilute the voting power and/or reduce the value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 18065, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "GTX"}
