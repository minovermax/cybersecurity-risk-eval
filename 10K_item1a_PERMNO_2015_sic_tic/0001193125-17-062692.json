Risk Factors\nExcept for the important factors relating to consummation of the Merger, the following important factors have been prepared as if our company were remaining independent. The following important factors, among others, could cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to be materially adversely affected. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 3.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe announcement and pendency of Hologic\u2019s proposed acquisition of our company pursuant to a tender offer and subsequent merger with a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Hologic could have an adverse effect on our stock price and/or our business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Offer and Merger could disrupt our business in the following ways, among others:\n\u2022\nthird parties may determine to delay or defer purchase decisions with regard to our products or terminate and/or attempt to renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the Offer and Merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us or otherwise;\n\u2022\nthe attention of our management may be directed toward the completion of the Offer and Merger and related matters, and their focus may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of our company, including from other opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us; and\n\u2022\ncurrent and prospective employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles with us (and, if the Merger is completed, Hologic), which might adversely affect our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel and may adversely affect the focus of our employees on development and sales of our products.\nAny of the above matters could adversely affect our stock price or harm our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nIf the proposed Merger is not consummated, our business and stock price could be adversely affected.\nThe consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. We expect to close the Merger in late March or April of 2017, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of these conditions. If the Merger is delayed or otherwise not consummated within the contemplated time periods or at all, we could suffer a number of consequences that may adversely affect our business, results of operations and stock price, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to the proposed Merger. These Merger-related expenses include investment banking fees and legal and other professional fees. These fees will be payable by us even if the Merger does not close;\n\u2022\nwe would be obligated to pay Hologic a $57.7 million termination fee in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances;\n\u2022\nour customers, prospective customers and investors in general may view the failure to consummate the Merger as a poor reflection on our business or prospects;\n\u2022\ncertain of our suppliers, distributors, and other business partners may seek to change or terminate their relationships with us as a result of the proposed Merger; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of our common stock may decline, particularly to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the proposed Merger will be completed.\nOur executive officers and directors may have interests that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally.\nOur executive officers and directors may have interests in the Offer and Merger that are different from, or are in addition to, those of our stockholders generally. These interests include direct or indirect ownership of our common stock, stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based stock units, and the receipt of change in control or other retention or severance payments in connection with the proposed transactions.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage or make it difficult for a third party to acquire our company prior to the completion of the Offer and the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it difficult for us to entertain a third-party proposal for an acquisition of our company. These provisions include our agreement not to solicit or initiate any additional discussions with third parties regarding other proposals for our acquisition, as well as restrictions on our ability to respond to such proposals, subject to fulfillment of certain fiduciary requirements of our board of directors. The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights, including, under certain circumstances, a requirement for us to pay to Hologic a termination fee of approximately $57.7 million.\nThese provisions might discourage an otherwise-interested third party from considering or proposing an acquisition of our company, even one that may be deemed of greater value to our stockholders than the Hologic offer. Furthermore, even if a third party elects to propose an acquisition, our obligation to pay a termination fee may result in that third party\u2019s offering of a lower value to our stockholders than such third party might otherwise have offered.\nA lawsuit has been filed, and additional lawsuits may be filed, against us and the members of our board of directors arising out of our acquisition by Hologic, which may delay or prevent the proposed transaction.\nA putative stockholder class action complaint has been filed against us and our board of directors in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. We and our directors believe the lawsuit is without merit; however, the outcome of such litigation is uncertain. Regardless of the outcome of this lawsuit, it could delay or prevent our acquisition by Hologic, divert the attention of our management and employees from our day-to-day business and otherwise adversely affect us financially.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred net losses in prior periods.\nWhile we were profitable in 2016, we incurred losses in the first quarter of 2015 and for the full year 2013. If we are unable to maintain profitability, the market value of our stock may decline, and an investor could lose all or a part of their investment.\nIf there is not sufficient consumer demand for the procedures performed with our products, practitioner demand for our products could decline, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nThe aesthetic laser and light-based treatment system industry in which we operate is particularly vulnerable to economic trends. Most procedures performed using our aesthetic treatment systems are elective procedures that are not reimbursable through government or private health insurance. The cost of these elective procedures must be borne by the patient. As a result, the decision to undergo a procedure that uses our products may be influenced by the cost.\nConsumer demand, and therefore our business, is sensitive to a number of factors that affect consumer spending, including political and macroeconomic conditions, health of credit markets, disposable consumer income levels, consumer debt levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and other factors. For example, consumer demand for the procedures performed with our products, and practitioner demand for our products, decreased dramatically during 2009 as a result of turmoil in the financial markets, which contributed to a significant decrease in our total product revenues during that year. If there is not sufficient consumer demand for the procedures performed with our products, practitioner demand for our products would decline, and our business would suffer.\nOur financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. For these reasons, comparing our financial results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. Our future quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may be significantly different from those we have recorded in the past or which we expect for the future. Our financial results in some quarters may fall below our expectations or the expectations of market analysts or investors. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, and the following factors, may adversely affect our financial results:\n\u2022\nour inability to introduce new products to the market in a timely fashion, or at all;\n\u2022\nour inability to quickly address and resolve reliability issues in our products and/or meet warranty and service obligations to our customers;\n\u2022\ncontinued availability of attractive equipment leasing terms for our customers, which may be negatively influenced by interest rate increases or lack of available credit;\n\u2022\nincreases in the length of our sales cycle; and\n\u2022\nreductions in the efficiency of our manufacturing processes.\nIn addition, we may be subject to seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations, because our customers may be more likely to make equipment purchasing decisions near year-end, and because practitioners may be less likely to make purchasing decisions in the summer months.\nOur competitors may prevent us from achieving further market penetration or improving operating results.\nCompetition in the aesthetic device industry is intense. Our products compete against products offered by public companies, such as Cutera, Syneron Medical, and ZELTIQ Aesthetics (whose acquisition by Allergan is pending), as well as several smaller specialized private companies, such as Alma Lasers (acquired in 2013 by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical) and Lumenis. Additional competitors may enter the market, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future.\nWe also face competition against non-laser and non-light-based medical products, such as BOTOX\u00ae and collagen injections, and surgical and non-surgical aesthetic procedures, such as face lifts, chemical peels, abdominoplasty, liposuction, microdermabrasion, sclerotherapy and electrolysis. We may also face competition from manufacturers of pharmaceutical and other products that have not yet been developed. As a result of competition with these companies, products and procedures, we could experience loss of market share and decreasing revenue as well as reduced prices and profit margins, any of which would harm our business and operating results.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish our company and our products from our competitors and their products. Factors affecting our competitive position include:\n\u2022\nproduct performance, reliability and design;\n\u2022\nability to sell products tailored to meet the applications needs of clients and patients;\n\u2022\nquality of customer support;\n\u2022\nproduct pricing;\n\u2022\nproduct safety;\n\u2022\nsales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\nsuccess and timing of new product development and introductions; and\n\u2022\nintellectual property protection.\nWe face exposure to credit risk of customers.\nIn the event of deterioration of general business conditions or the availability of credit, the financial strength and stability of our customers and potential customers may deteriorate over time, which may cause them to cancel or delay their purchase of our products. In addition, we may be subject to increased risk of non-payment of our accounts receivables. We may also be adversely affected by bankruptcies or other business failures of our customers and potential customers. A significant delay in the collection of funds or a reduction of funds collected may impact our liquidity or result in bad debts.\nIf we do not continue to develop and commercialize new products and identify new markets for our products and technology, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.\nThe aesthetic laser and light-based treatment system industry is subject to continuous technological development and product innovation. If we do not continue to innovate and develop new products and applications, our competitive position will likely deteriorate as other companies successfully design and commercialize new products and applications. Accordingly, our success depends in part on developing or acquiring new and innovative applications of laser and other light-based technology and identifying new markets for and applications of existing products and technology. If we are unable to develop and commercialize new products, identify and acquire complementary businesses, products or technologies, and identify new markets for our products and technology, our product and technology offerings could become obsolete and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nTo remain competitive, we must:\n\u2022\ndevelop or acquire new technologies that either add to or significantly improve our current products;\n\u2022\nconvince our target practitioner customers that our new products or product upgrades would be attractive revenue-generating additions to their practices;\n\u2022\nsell our products to non-traditional customers, including primary care physicians, gynecologists and other specialists;\n\u2022\nidentify new markets and emerging technological trends in our target markets and react effectively to technological changes;\n\u2022\npreserve goodwill and brand value with customers; and\n\u2022\nmaintain effective sales and marketing strategies.\nIf our new products do not gain market acceptance, our revenues and operating results could suffer, and our newer generation product sales could cause earlier generation product sales to suffer.\nThe commercial success of the products and technology we develop will depend upon the acceptance of these products by providers of aesthetic procedures and their patients and clients. It is difficult for us to predict how successful recently introduced products, or products we are currently developing, will be over the long term. If the products we develop do not gain market acceptance or meet customer expectations, our revenues and operating results could suffer.\nWe expect that many of the products we develop will be based upon new technologies or new applications of existing technologies. It may be difficult for us to achieve market acceptance of some of our products, particularly the first products that we introduce to the market based on new technologies or new applications of existing technologies.\nAs we introduce new technologies to the market, our earlier generation product sales could suffer, which may result in write-offs of those earlier generation products.\nIf demand for our aesthetic treatment systems by physician customers does not increase, our revenues will suffer and our business will be harmed.\nWe market our aesthetic treatment systems to physicians and other practitioners. We believe, and our growth expectations assume, that we and other companies selling lasers and other light-based aesthetic treatment systems have not fully penetrated these markets and that we will continue to receive a significant percentage of our revenues from selling to these markets. If our expectations as to the size of these markets and our ability to sell our products to participants in these markets are not correct, our revenues will suffer and our business will be harmed.\nWe sell our products and services through subsidiaries and distributors in numerous international markets. Our operating results may suffer if we are unable to manage our international operations effectively.\nWe sell our products and services through subsidiaries and distributors in over 120 foreign countries, and we therefore are subject to risks associated with having international operations. We derived 32%, 39%, and 48% of our product revenues from sales outside North America for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nOur international sales are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nforeign certification and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations;\n\u2022\nimport and export controls; and\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability.\nIf we are unsuccessful at managing these risks, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may incur foreign currency conversion charges as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, which could cause our operating results to suffer.\nThe U.S. dollar is our functional currency. Although we sell our products and services through subsidiaries and distributors in over 120 foreign countries, approximately 39% and 46% of our revenues outside of North America for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were denominated in or linked to the U.S. dollar. Substantially all of our remaining revenues and all of our operating costs outside of North America are recognized in euros, British pounds, Moroccan dirham, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, South Korean won and Australian dollars. We have not historically engaged in hedging activities relating to our non-U.S. dollar operations. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the currencies in which such revenues are realized or costs are incurred and the U.S. dollar may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2016 we incurred a loss on foreign currency of $0.8 million, which is recorded as other expense, net within our consolidated statement of operations. This was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound, Korean won and Chinese yuan.\nWe may not receive revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all.\nInvestment in product development often involves a long payback cycle and risks associated with new technology. For example, our SculpSure laser system, which we launched in 2015, was in development for five years. Our PicoSure laser system, which we launched in 2013, was in development for several years. We have made and expect to continue making significant investments in research and development and related product\nopportunities. Accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we may not generate anticipated revenues from these investments for several years, if at all.\nBecause we do not require training for users of our non-invasive products, and we sell these products to non-physicians, there exists an increased potential for misuse of these products, which could harm our reputation and our business.\nFederal regulations allow us to sell our products to or on the order of practitioners licensed by law to use or order the use of a prescription device. The definition of \u201clicensed practitioners\u201d varies from state to state. As a result, our products may be purchased or operated by physicians with varying levels of training and, in many states, by non-physicians, including nurse practitioners, chiropractors and technicians. Outside the United States, many jurisdictions do not require specific qualifications or training for purchasers or operators of our products. We do not supervise the procedures performed with our products, nor can we require that direct medical supervision occur. We and our distributors offer product training sessions, but neither we nor our distributors require purchasers or operators of our non-invasive products to attend training sessions. The lack of required training and the purchase and use of our non-invasive products by non-physicians may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain management and other personnel we need to succeed.\nOur success depends on the services of our senior management and other key research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing employees. The loss of the services of one or more of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our business. We consider retaining Michael R. Davin, our chief executive officer, key to our efforts to develop, sell and market our products and remain competitive. We have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Davin; however, the employment agreement is terminable by him on short notice and may not ensure his continued service with our company. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees. We cannot be certain that we will be able to do so.\nWe may seek to acquire companies or technologies, which could disrupt our ongoing business, divert the attention of our management and employees and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may, from time to time, evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of other complementary businesses, products or technologies, as well as consider joint ventures and other collaborative projects. We may not be able to identify suitable future acquisition candidates, consummate acquisitions on favorable terms or complete otherwise favorable acquisitions because of antitrust or other regulatory concerns. We cannot be certain that the acquisitions we have completed, including our 2014 acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Ellman International, Inc., or any future acquisitions that we may make, will enhance our products or strengthen our competitive position. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the acquired businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, and in retaining and motivating key personnel from these businesses. The integration of these businesses may not result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from this integration and these benefits may not be achieved within a reasonable period of time.\nOur stock price has fluctuated substantially, and we expect it will continue to do so.\nOur Class A common stock price has fluctuated substantially in recent years, and we expect it will continue to do so. From January 1, 2012 through February 21, 2017, our Class A common stock has traded as high as\n$66.50 per share and as low as $11.64 per share. The stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our Class A common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nactivism by any single large stockholder or combination of stockholders;\n\u2022\nsecurities or other litigation;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our industry and issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\npurchases or sales of our stock by our officers and directors;\n\u2022\nrepurchases of shares of our Class A common stock; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, if the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur common stock could be further diluted by the conversion of outstanding options, restricted stock units and performance-based stock units.\nIn the past, we have issued and still have outstanding convertible securities in the form of options, restricted stock units and performance-based stock units. We may continue to issue options, restricted stock units, performance-based stock units and other equity rights as compensation for services and incentive compensation for our employees, directors and consultants or others who provide services to us. We have a substantial number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the conversion and exercise of these securities. Such a conversion would dilute our stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to successfully continue collecting licensing royalties.\nSince 2013, portions of our revenues have consisted of royalties from sub-licensing patents, including patents licensed to us on an exclusive basis by MGH. These patents expired in the United States on February 1, 2015 and their foreign counterparts expired in several foreign jurisdictions on January 31, 2016. Though we receive royalty revenues on other patents, our revenues have decreased as a result of the expiration of the MGH patents because we will no longer receive any royalties from such patents, and such license revenues may not be replaced.\nWe face risks associated with product warranties.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of product failures for which we are responsible under warranty obligations.\nIf we are unable to protect our information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our reputation, business and operating results may suffer.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including\nprocurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, and invoicing and collection of payments for our products. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, are susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. If our information technology systems are damaged, disrupted or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our reputation, business and operating results may suffer.\nSimilar security risks exist with respect to our business partners and the third-party vendors that we rely on for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities of our business partners and third-party vendors may adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our information technology systems.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nIf we fail to obtain key components of our products from our sole source or limited source suppliers or service providers, our ability to manufacture and sell our products would be impaired and our business could be materially harmed.\nWe depend on sole or limited suppliers of certain components and systems that are critical to the products that we manufacture and sell, and to which the significant majority of our revenues are attributable. We depend on a single contract manufacturer in the United States for the subassembly of certain products that we manufacture and sell, and for the manufacturing of certain products that we sell, and to which a significant portion of our revenues are attributable to these products. We depend on El.En. for the SLT II laser system that we integrate with our own proprietary software and delivery systems into our SmartLipo Triplex, Cellulaze, and PrecisionTx systems. We also depend on El.En. for the MonaLisa Touch laser system. For further information regarding our distribution agreements with El.En., please see the discussion on page 19 of this Annual Report. We use Alexandrite rods to manufacture the lasers for our Elite and PicoSure products and Nd:YAG rods to manufacture the lasers for our RevLite / MedLite C6 products. We depend exclusively on Northrop Grumman SYNOPTICS to supply both the Alexandrite and Nd:YAG rods to us, and we are aware of no alternative supplier of Alexandrite rods meeting our quality standards. We offer our SmartCool treatment cooling systems for use with our laser aesthetic treatment systems, and we depend exclusively on Zimmer Elektromedizin GmbH to supply SmartCool systems to us. In addition, one third-party supplier assembles and tests many of the components and subassemblies for our Elite and Cynergy product families. We use diode laser bars from Coherent to manufacture our Vectus diode laser, and we use diode laser modules from Dilas to manufacture our SculpSure\u00ae laser system. Although alternative suppliers exist for the diode laser subassemblies and diode laser bars, they could take months to qualify and implement.\nOther than with El.En., we do not have long-term arrangements with any of our suppliers or our contract manufacturer for the supply of these components or systems or with the assembly and test service provider referenced above, but instead purchase from them on a purchase order basis or with one year purchase agreements. Northrop Grumman SYNOPTICS, Zimmer Elektromedizin, IPG Photonics, Dilas and Coherent are not required, and may not be able or willing, to meet our future requirements at current prices, or at all.\nUnder our agreements with El.En. and our purchase order arrangements with our other suppliers and service providers, we are vulnerable to supply shortages and cessations and price fluctuations with respect to these critical components and systems and services. Such shortages or cessations could occur either as a result of breach by El.En. or us of our distribution agreements, or as a result of other types of business decisions made by El.En. or other suppliers and service providers. Any extended interruption in our supplies of these components or systems or in the assembly and test services could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party distributors to market, sell and service a significant portion of our products. If these distributors do not commit the necessary resources to effectively market, sell and service our products or if our relationships with these distributors are disrupted, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nIn the United States, Canada, France, Morocco, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Australia, China, Japan and Korea, we sell our products through our internal sales organization. Outside of these markets, we sell our products through third-party distributors. Our sales and marketing success in these other markets depends on these distributors, in particular their sales and service expertise and relationships with the customers in the marketplace. Sales of our aesthetic treatment systems by third-party distributors represented 12%, 17% and 21% of our product revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe do not control our distributors, and these parties may not be successful in marketing our products. These parties may fail to commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations. Currently, we have written distributor agreements in place with most of our third-party distributors. We cannot be sure that our distributors will agree with our interpretation of the terms of the agreements or that we will receive payments under the agreements. The third-party distributors with which we do not have written distributor agreements may also disagree with the terms of our relationship. Our distributors may terminate their relationships with us and stop selling and servicing our products with little or no notice. If current or future third-party distributors or other parties that sell our products do not perform adequately, or if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with these parties or fail to recruit and retain distributors in particular geographic areas, our revenue from international sales may be adversely affected and our operating results could suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with El.En. and Our Corporate Structure\nEl.En. and its subsidiaries market and sell products that compete with our products, and any increased competition from El.En. could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEl.En. is a leading laser manufacturer in Europe and a leading light-based medical device manufacturer worldwide. El.En. and its subsidiaries develop and produce laser systems with scientific, industrial, commercial and medical applications. Under exclusive distribution agreements with El.En., we purchase from El.En. its proprietary SmartLipo MPX system and its SLT II laser system. The SLT II laser system is an essential component of our SmartLipo Triplex and Cellulaze systems, which also incorporate our proprietary software and delivery systems. We also depend on El.En. for the MonaLisa Touch laser system. For further information regarding our distribution agreements with El.En., please see the discussion on page 19 of this Annual Report.\nEl.En. markets, sells, promotes and licenses other products that compete with our products, both in North America and elsewhere throughout the world and our agreements with El.En. do not prevent El.En. from competing with us by selling products that we purchased in the past from El.En., including earlier generation SmartLipo systems. Our business could be materially and adversely affected by increased competition from El.En.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us.\nSeveral provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe classification of the members of our board of directors until our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, at which point the full board of directors will be declassified and each director will be elected on an annual basis;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of our directors until our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, after which our directors may be removed with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nAbsent approval of our board of directors, our bylaws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Section 203 may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur products may infringe, or it may be claimed that they infringe, patents or patent applications under which we do not hold licenses or other rights. Third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the United States and abroad. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit.\nAs a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both, as we did in a 2006 patent license agreement with Palomar Medical Technologies, Inc. Such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could harm our business significantly.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in our industry. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other types of patent litigation and other proceedings, including reexamination proceedings, inter partes or post-grant review or interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights relating to our technology and products, the commercial value of our technology and products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to obtain protection in the United States and other countries for our products by establishing and maintaining intellectual property rights relating to or incorporated into our technology and products. We own numerous patents and patent applications in the United States and corresponding patents and patent applications in many foreign jurisdictions. We do not know how successful we would be in any instance in which we asserted our patents against suspected infringers. Our pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that would be advantageous to us. Even if issued, our patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection we may have for our products. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nWe jointly own patents and patent applications with third parties. Our ability to exploit or enforce these patent rights, or to prevent the third party from granting licenses to others with respect to these patent rights, may be limited in some circumstances.\nWe jointly own certain patents and patent applications with third parties. In the absence of an agreement with each co-owner of jointly owned patent rights, we will be subject to default rules pertaining to joint ownership. Some countries require the consent of all joint owners to exploit, license or assign jointly owned patents, and if we are unable to obtain that consent from the joint owners, we may be unable to exploit the invention or to license or assign our rights under these patents and patent applications in those countries.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how. We generally seek to protect this information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain necessary FDA clearances and approvals for our products and indications or if clearances and approvals for future products and indications are delayed or not issued, our business would be harmed.\nOur products are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other federal, state and local authorities. These regulations relate to manufacturing, design, labeling, sale, promotion, distribution, importing and exporting and shipping of our products. In the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, or claim for, an existing product, we must first receive either 510(k) clearance or premarket approval from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. Both of these processes can be expensive and lengthy and entail significant user fees, unless exempt. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process often takes from three to 12 months. The FDA may require us to withdraw an application if they cannot make a determination that the device is substantially equivalent according to the regulations. In such situations, we may re-submit the 510(k) application with additional data for reconsideration or we may determine not to commercialize the device or the new indication for use. The process of obtaining premarket approval is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. It generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the premarket approval application, or PMA, is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained.\nIn order to obtain premarket approval and, in some cases, a 510(k) clearance, a product sponsor must conduct well controlled clinical trials designed to test the safety and effectiveness of the product. Conducting clinical trials generally entails a long, expensive and uncertain process that is subject to delays and failure at any stage. The data obtained from clinical trials may be inadequate to support approval or clearance of a submission. In addition, the occurrence of unexpected findings in connection with clinical trials may prevent or delay obtaining approval or clearance. If we conduct clinical trials, they may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval or clearance, for numerous reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe FDA, other regulatory authorities or an institutional review board may place a clinical trial on hold;\n\u2022\npatients may not enroll in clinical trials, or patient follow-up may not occur, at the rate we expect;\n\u2022\npatients may not comply with trial protocols;\n\u2022\ninstitutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject our trial protocol;\n\u2022\nthird-party clinical investigators may decline to participate in a trial or may not perform a trial on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices, or other FDA requirements;\n\u2022\nthird-party organizations may not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\nregulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials, or invalidate our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions; and\n\u2022\nthe interim or final results of the clinical trials may be inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or effectiveness.\nMedical devices may be marketed only for the indications for which they are approved or cleared. The FDA may not approve or clear indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. Indeed, the FDA may refuse our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products. Our clearances can be revoked if safety or effectiveness problems develop.\nIn addition, if the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for products or modifications to products than we expect, or at a particular time in the future had expected, our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could negatively affect our ability to generate sales, or cause sales at such time to decline. For example, the FDA could demand that we obtain a PMA prior to marketing certain of our products in cases in which we did not expect to have to obtain a PMA. If we were to determine that a product we plan to market is subject to an exemption from premarket review, the FDA could disagree with our determination and could require us to submit a 510(k) or PMA in order to continue marketing the product.\nFinally, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of products we are developing or impact our ability to modify any of our products for which we receive regulatory clearance or approval in the future on a timely basis. Any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to the products we are developing could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for such products, or to produce, market and distribute products for which we receive regulatory approval or clearance in the future.\nAfter clearance or approval of our products, we are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, and if we fail to comply with FDA regulations, or other regulations to which we are subject, our business could suffer.\nEven after clearance or approval of a product, we are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including the requirements that our facility be registered and our devices be listed with the agency. We are subject to Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require us to report to the FDA if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. We must report corrections and removals to the FDA where the correction or removal was initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, caused by the device that may present a risk to health, and maintain records of other corrections or removals. The FDA closely regulates promotion and advertising and our promotional and advertising activities could come under scrutiny. If the FDA objects to our promotional and advertising activities or finds that we failed to submit reports under the Medical Device Reporting regulations, for example, the FDA may allege our activities resulted in violations.\nViolations of the FDCA and other laws and regulations to which we are subject may lead to investigations by the FDA, Department of Justice, or DOJ, and state Attorneys General. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product distribution or use of a product;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or new intended uses;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u2022\nrepair, replacement, refunds, recalls or seizure or detention of our products;\n\u2022\nconsent decrees;\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\ndamage to relationships with any potential contributors;\n\u2022\nunfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation; or\n\u2022\nlitigation involving patients using our products.\nNon-compliance with European Union requirements can also result in significant financial penalties.\nWe may be subject to enforcement action if we engage in improper marketing or promotion of any of our products for which we receive regulatory clearance or approval. Any such enforcement action could result in significant fines, costs and penalties and could result in damage to our reputation.\nOur promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of unapproved use. Use of a device outside its cleared or\napproved diseases or conditions is known as \u201coff-label\u201d use. Despite our efforts to comply with such laws and regulations, physicians may use our products for which we receive regulatory clearance or approval off-label, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or other product labeling constitute promotion of an unapproved, or off-label, use, it could request that we modify our materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, recall, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties.\nOther federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, have issued guidelines and regulations that govern how we will be required to promote products for which we receive regulatory clearance or approval, including how we may use endorsements and testimonials. If our promotional materials are inconsistent with these guidelines or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, which could result in significant fines, costs and penalties. Our reputation could also be damaged and the adoption of our products could be impaired. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in substantial damage awards against us and harm our reputation.\nIn the EU, our medical devices may be promoted only for the intended purpose for which the devices have been CE marked. Failure to comply with this requirement could lead to the imposition of penalties by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. The penalties could include warnings, orders to discontinue the promotion of the medical device, seizure of the promotional materials and fines. The promotional materials related to any of our products that may be CE marked in the future must also comply with various laws and codes of conduct developed by medical device industry bodies in the EU governing promotional claims, comparative advertising, advertising of medical devices reimbursed by the national health insurance systems and advertising to the general public. If we do not comply with these laws and industry codes, we could be subject to penalties which could include significant fines. Our reputation could also be damaged and the adoption of our products after receipt of a CE mark could be impaired.\nWe have modified some of our products without FDA clearance. Modifications to any FDA-cleared or approved products may require new regulatory clearances or approvals or require us to recall or cease marketing such products until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nWe have made modifications to our devices in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. Any modification to one of our 510(k)-cleared products that would constitute a major change in its intended use or any change that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device would require us to obtain a new 510(k) marketing clearance and may even, in some circumstances, require the submission of a PMA, if the change raises complex or novel scientific issues or the product has a new intended use. We may be required to submit extensive pre-clinical and clinical data depending on the nature of the changes. We may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals for modifications to, or additional diseases or conditions for, any products for which we receive regulatory clearance or approval in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our revenue and operating results.\nThe FDA requires every manufacturer to make the determination regarding the need for a new 510(k) submission in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer\u2019s decision. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to seek new 510(k) clearances or PMA approval for modifications to our previously-cleared products for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or distribution of the products or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nFurthermore, potential changes to the 510(k) program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to any of our then-previously-cleared products, by either imposing more strict requirements on\nwhen a new 510(k) clearance for a modification to a previously-cleared product must be submitted or applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions. In 2011, respectively, the FDA issued draft guidance documents addressing when to submit a new 510(k) clearance due to modifications to 510(k)-cleared products and the criteria for evaluating substantial equivalence. The 2011 draft guidance was ultimately withdrawn as the result of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. As a result, the FDA\u2019s original guidance document regarding 510(k) modifications, which dates back to 1997, remains in place. However, the FDA may seek to issue new guidance on product modifications. Any efforts to do so could result in a more rigorous review process and make it more difficult to obtain clearance for device modifications.\nIf we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with ongoing FDA and EU or other foreign regulatory authority requirements concerning manufacturing operations and laser performance standards, our products could be subject to additional restrictions and withdrawal from the market, which would harm our business.\nWe are currently required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR. The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. Because our products involve the use of lasers, our products also are covered by a performance standard for lasers set forth in FDA regulations. The laser performance standard imposes specific record keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements. These requirements include affixing warning labels to laser products as well as incorporating certain safety features in the design of laser products. In the EU countries, compliance with harmonized standards is also recommended as this is interpreted as a presumption of conformity with the relevant Essential Requirements. The FDA enforces the QSR and laser performance standards through periodic unannounced inspections. We have been, and anticipate in the future being, subject to such inspections.\nThese FDA regulations and EU standards cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of any products for which we may obtain regulatory clearance or approval. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA. Compliance with harmonized standards in the EU is also subject to regular review through the conduct of inspection by Notified Bodies or other certification bodies. If we, or our contract manufacturers, fail to adhere to QSR requirements in the United States or other harmonized standards in the EU, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances or CE Certificates of Conformity, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe FDA audits compliance with the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. The failure by us or any of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA, or harmonized standards in the EU, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in various enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of or restrictions on our manufacturing operations, delays in approving or clearing a product, refusal to permit the import or export of our products, a recall or seizure of our products, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions, such as those described in the preceding paragraphs, any of which could cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nIf any of our products for which we receive regulatory clearance or approval cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions, which could harm our business.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury\nor has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device of such manufacturer were to recur. The decision to file an MDR involves a judgment by us as the manufacturer. If and when we make such decisions in the future, the FDA may not agree with our decisions. If we fail to report MDRs to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, or if the FDA disagrees with any of our determinations regarding the reportability of certain events, the FDA could take enforcement actions against us, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation and financial results.\nAdditionally, all manufacturers placing medical devices in the market in the EU are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. In the EU, we must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU countries, and manufacturers are required to take Field Safety Corrective Actions, or FSCAs, to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration if the characteristics or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its European Authorized Representative to its customers and to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices.\nAny such safety issues involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nAny of the products for which we receive regulatory clearance or approval may be subject to product recalls. A recall of such products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our future products, could have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. The authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us, or any distributor we may have in the future, could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues.\nWe are also required to follow detailed recordkeeping requirements for all company-initiated medical device corrections and removals and to report such corrective and removal actions to the FDA if they are carried out in response to a risk to health and have not otherwise been reported under the MDR regulations. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products for which we receive regulatory clearance or approval in the future that we determine do not require notification to the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, the FDA could require us to report those actions as recalls. Recalls of any of our products for which we receive regulatory clearance or approval in the future would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We may also be subject to enforcement actions or liability claims, any may be required to bear other costs, or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.\nIf we fail to comply with state laws and regulations, or if state laws or regulations change, our business could suffer.\nIn addition to FDA regulations, most of our products are also subject to state regulations relating to their sale and use. These regulations are complex and vary from state to state, which complicates monitoring compliance. In addition, these regulations are in many instances in flux. For example, federal regulations allow our prescription products to be sold to or on the order of \u201clicensed practitioners,\u201d that is, practitioners licensed by law to use or order the use of a prescription device. Licensed practitioners are defined on a state-by-state basis. As a result, some states permit non-physicians to purchase and operate our products, while other states do not. Additionally, a state could change its regulations at any time to prohibit sales to particular types of customers. We believe that, to date, we have sold our prescription products only to licensed practitioners. However, our failure to comply with state laws or regulations and changes in state laws or regulations may adversely affect our business.\nWe, or our distributors, may be unable to obtain or maintain foreign regulatory qualifications or approvals for our current or future products and indications, which could harm our business.\nSales of our products outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In many countries, our third-party distributors are responsible for obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for our products. We do not control our third-party distributors, and they may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining these regulatory approvals.\nComplying with foreign regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time consuming process, and approval is not certain. The time required to obtain foreign clearances or approvals may be longer than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and requirements for such clearances or approvals may differ significantly from FDA requirements. Foreign regulatory authorities may not clear or approve our products for the same indications cleared or approved by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA clearance or approval in addition to other risks. Although we or our distributors have obtained regulatory approvals in the European Union and other countries outside the United States for many of our products, we or our distributors may be unable to maintain regulatory qualifications, clearances or approvals in these countries or obtain qualifications, clearances or approvals in other countries. If we are not successful in doing so, our business will be harmed. We may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory clearances, approvals or qualifications. Foreign regulatory agencies, as well as the FDA, periodically inspect manufacturing facilities both in the United States and abroad. If we experience delays in receiving necessary qualifications, clearances or approvals to market our products outside the United States, or if we fail to receive those qualifications, clearances or approvals, or if we fail to comply with other foreign regulatory requirements, we and our distributors may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets effectively, or at all. Additionally, the imposition of new requirements may significantly affect our business and our products. We may not be able to adjust to such new requirements, which may adversely affect our business.\nFederal regulatory reforms may adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of a device. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. For example, the FDA proposed changing its standards for determining when a medical device modification must receive premarket clearance or approval. Although Congress objected to these revised standards, it is possible that the FDA will seek to implement these or similar changes in the future.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes reporting and disclosure requirements, commonly referred to as the \u201cSunshine Act\u201d, for \u201capplicable manufacturers\u201d of drugs, biological, medical devices and\nmedical supplies with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain physicians and teaching hospitals. The final rules implementing the Sunshine Act are complex, ambiguous, and broad in scope. Sales related to the Ellman surgical product line are subject to the reporting requirements under the Sunshine Act. We believe that sales related to our aesthetic product lines fall under a reporting exception under this law and, accordingly, reporting related to those sales is not required. With the new U.S. presidential administration and Congress, there will likely be additional legislative changes, including the possible repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the Sunshine Act, but it is unclear if and when such legislation would be enacted, what it would provide and what impact it would have on, among other things, reporting and disclosure requirements.\nThere are a number of federal and state laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services promulgated patient privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. These privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most use and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. If we or any of our service providers are found to be in violation of the promulgated patient privacy rules under HIPAA, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Similarly, failure to comply with the European Union\u2019s requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nOur compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements is, and will continue to be, costly and time consuming. It is impossible to predict whether other legislative changes will be enacted or government regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. If we are found to be in violation of any of this or any other law, we may be subject to penalties, including fines.\nIn addition, most of the products and systems that we sell became subject in 2013 to an excise tax on sales of certain medical devices in the United States after December 31, 2012 by the manufacturer, producer or importer in an amount equal to 2.3% of the sale price. Under the law, additional charges, including warranties, may be deemed to be included in the sale price for purposes of determining the amount of the excise tax. Although this excise tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017, we cannot predict whether it will be reinstated, and if it is, we believe it could harm our future sales and profitability.\nRisks Related to Litigation\nIf our past fax practices are shown to have violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, that could have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn the past, we have used faxes to disseminate information about our clinical workshops to large numbers of customers and potential customers. Under the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, recipients of noncompliant fax advertisements are entitled to $500 per violation, and that amount may be increased up to $1,500 for knowing or willful violations.\nIn July 2016, we were sued in federal court by ARcare, Inc., or ARcare, individually and as putative representative of a purported class under the TCPA. The plaintiff alleges that we violated the TCPA by sending fax advertisements that did not comply with statutory and Federal Communications Commission requirements that senders provide recipients with certain information about how to opt out from receiving faxed advertisements in the future, and by sending unsolicited fax advertisements.\nWe answered the complaint and denied liability, and in January 2017, we entered into an agreement to settle the lawsuit. The settlement agreement was subject to court approval and, if approved, would have given\nCynosure a full release from the settlement class concerning the conduct alleged in the complaint. However, the court overseeing the matter subsequently expressed concern about aspects of the settlement agreement, and in February 2017, we and ARcare agreed in principle to new terms to be incorporated into a new settlement agreement. The new settlement agreement will be subject to further negotiation, and thereafter the settlement agreement will be subject to court approval. As with the initial settlement, if approved, we would receive a full release from the settlement class concerning the conduct alleged in the complaint.\nLitigation is subject to numerous uncertainties and we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter. Even if we prevail in or are able to settle this lawsuit, other claims may be brought against us alleging past violations of the TCPA. Moreover, the amount of any potential liability in connection with other possible lawsuits will depend, to a large extent, on whether a settlement class is certified in the ARcare matter, which we cannot predict at this time. We have tendered a claim with respect to the ARcare lawsuit to our general liability insurance carrier and the carrier has indicated that coverage is unlikely for this claim.\nWe may be required to pay damages in respect of this lawsuit or other possible future lawsuits arising out of our past fax transmissions, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Regardless of the outcome, this lawsuit or other possible future lawsuits may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nProduct liability and business liability suits could be brought against us due to defective design, material or workmanship or due to misuse of our products. These lawsuits could be expensive and time consuming and result in substantial damages to us and increases in our insurance rates.\nIf our products are defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation by our customers or their patients or clients. Misusing our products or failing to adhere to operating guidelines for our products can cause severe burns or other significant damage to the eyes, skin or other tissue. If our products fail to function properly, we may be required to conduct product recalls and our customers may lose the ability to treat their patients or clients resulting in a loss of business for our customers. We are routinely involved in claims related to the use of our products. Product liability and business liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us. Our current insurance coverage may not apply or may not be sufficient to cover these claims, and the coverage we have is subject to deductibles for which we are responsible. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to obtain insurance in amount or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Any product liability or other claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, could harm our reputation in the industry and reduce product sales. We would need to pay any losses in excess of our insurance coverage out of cash reserves, harming our financial condition and adversely affecting our operating results.\nEmployment related lawsuits could be brought against us for improper termination of employment, sexual harassment, hostile work environment and other claims. These lawsuits could be expensive and time consuming and result in substantial damages to us and increases in our insurance rates.\nIf we terminate employment for improper reasons or fail to provide an appropriate work environment or it is alleged that we did so, we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation by our former and current employees. We are routinely involved in claims related to improper termination and other claims. Such claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us. Our current insurance coverage may not apply or may not be sufficient to cover these claims, and the coverage we have is subject to deductibles for which we are responsible. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to obtain insurance in amount or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Any employment related claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our\nemployment law insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, could harm our reputation in the industry and reduce product sales. We would need to pay any losses in excess of our insurance coverage out of cash reserves, harming our financial condition and adversely affecting our operating results.", "PERMNO": 91020, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "CYNO"}
