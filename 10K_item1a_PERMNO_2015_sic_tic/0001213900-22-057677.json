{"cik": "1158780", "company": "Pluri Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-09-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following information about these risks, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report before making an investment decision. Our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected as a result of any of the following risks. The value of our securities could decline as a result of any of these risks. You could lose all or part of your investment in our securities. Some of the statements in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d are forward-looking statements. The following risk factors are not the only risk factors facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\n\u25cf the COVID-19 pandemic has caused interruptions and delays of our business plan and may have a adverse effect on our business;\n\u25cf we have a history of losses and have not generated significant revenues to date. We expect to experience future losses and do not foresee generating significant or steady revenues in the immediate future;\n\u25cf we may need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future, and such capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and could dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership interests, and such offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of our common shares may cause the price of our publicly traded shares to decline;\n\u25cf we may become subject to claims by much larger and better funded competitors enforcing their intellectual property rights against us or seeking to invalidate our intellectual property or our rights thereto;\n\u25cf there are inherent risks in the manufacturing of our product candidates, including meeting relevant high regulatory standards, the failure of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our business;\n\u25cf if we are unable to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection covering our products and technology, others may be able to utilize our intellectual property, which would adversely affect our business;\n\u25cf we are an international business, and we are exposed to various global and local risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u25cf the market prices of our common shares are subject to fluctuation and have been and may continue to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors;\n\u25cf we anticipate being subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States and we are exposed to currency exchange fluctuations in other currencies such as the New Israeli Shekel, or NIS, and the Euro;\n\u25cf restrictions and covenants contained in the EIB Finance Agreement may restrict our ability to conduct certain strategic initiatives;\n\u25cf limitations we may face relating to the grants we have received from the IIA may impact our plans and future decisions;\n\u25cf if there are significant shifts in the political, economic and military conditions in Israel and its neighboring countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business relationships and profitability;\n\u25cf it may be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce any judgments obtained against us or some of our directors or officers;\n\u25cf cybersecurity incidents may have an adverse impact on our business and operations;\n\u25cf recent increasing global inflation could affect our ability to purchase materials needed for manufacturing and could increase the costs of our future product;\n\u25cf we have a limited operating history in the field of food-tech to date and our prospects will be dependent on our ability to meet a number of challenges;\n\u25cf our business and market potential in the field of food-tech are unproven, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business; and\n\u25cf the research and development associated with technologies for cultivated meat manufacturing, is a lengthy and complex process.\nRisk Related to Our Business\nWe may need to raise additional financing to support the research, development and manufacturing of our cell based products in the future, but we cannot be sure we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us when needed. If we are unable to obtain additional financing to meet our needs, our operations may be adversely affected or terminated.\nIt is highly likely that we will need to raise significant additional capital in the future. Although we were successful in raising capital in the past, our current financial resources are limited, and may not be sufficient to finance our operations until we become profitable, if that ever happens.\nIt is likely that we will need to raise additional funds in the future in order to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. Therefore, we are dependent on our ability to sell our common shares for funds, receive grants, enter into collaborations and licensing deals or to otherwise raise capital. Any sale of our common shares in the future could result in dilution to existing shareholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nAlso, we may not be able to raise additional capital in the future to support the development and commercialization of our products, which could result in the loss of some or all of one\u2019s investment in our common shares.\nOur likelihood of profitability depends on our ability to license and/or develop and commercialize our products based on our technology, which is currently in the development stage. If we are unable to complete the development and commercialization of our cell-based products successfully, or are unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, our likelihood of profitability will be limited severely.\nWe are engaged in the business of developing cell-based products. We have not realized a profit from our operations to date and there is little likelihood that we will realize any profits in the short or medium term. Any profitability in the future from our business will be dependent upon successful commercialization of our cell-based products and/or licensing of our products, which will require additional research and development.\nIf our cell therapy product candidates do not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials, we will not obtain the required regulatory approvals. If we fail to obtain such approvals, we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations.\nEven after granting regulatory approval, the FDA, the EMA, and regulatory agencies in other countries continue to regulate marketed products, manufacturers and manufacturing facilities, which may create additional regulatory barriers and burdens. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility, may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer, including a withdrawal of the product from the market.\nWe have not generated significant or consistent revenues to date, which raises doubts with respect to our ability to generate revenues in the future.\nWe have a limited operating history in our business of commercializing cell production technology and we have not generate any material revenues to date. It is not clear when we will generate revenues or whether we will generate revenues in the future. We cannot give assurances that we will be able to generate any significant revenues or income in the future. There is no assurance that we will ever be profitable.\nBecause most of our officers and directors are located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, you may have no effective recourse against the management for misconduct and may not be able to enforce judgment and civil liabilities against our officers, directors, experts and agents.\nMost of our directors and officers are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States.\nAs a result, it may be difficult to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against our officers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any U.S. state.\nWhile we may seek partners for licensing deals, joint ventures, partnerships, and direct sale of our products in various industries, there is no guarantee we will be successful in doing so.\nTo date, we have focused our efforts primarily in the regenerative medicine field, but we may seek partners for licensing deals, joint ventures, partnerships, and direct sale of our products or use of our technology in various industries. Licensing deals, joint ventures and partnerships in new fields involve numerous risks, including the potential integration of our technology and products in various new ways, which may or may not be successful. Such projects may require significant funds, time and attention of management and other key personnel. In addition, as we do not have experience in areas outside of the regenerative medicine field, we may lack the personnel to properly lead such initiatives. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in finding the relevant partners to fund and market the cell based products.\nRisks Related to Development, Clinical studies, and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nIf we are not able to conduct our clinical trials properly and on schedule, marketing approval by FDA, EMA, MOH and other regulatory authorities may be delayed or denied.\nThe completion of our future clinical trials may be delayed or terminated for many reasons, such as:\n\u25cf The FDA, the EMA or the MOH does not grant permission to proceed or places trials on clinical hold;\n\u25cf Subjects do not enroll in our trials at the rate we expect.\n\u25cf Government actions, such as those enacted during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which limit the general populations movement;\n\u25cf The regulators may ask to increase subject\u2019s population in the clinical trials;\n\u25cf Subjects experience an unacceptable rate or severity of adverse side effects;\n\u25cf Third party clinical investigators and other related vendors may not perform the clinical trials under the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, GCP and regulatory requirements.\n\u25cf Third party clinical investigators and other related vendors may declare bankruptcy or terminate their business unexpectedly, which most likely will result in further delays in our clinical trials\u2019 anticipated schedule and cause additional expenditures;\n\u25cf Inspections of clinical trial sites by the FDA, EMA, MOH and other regulatory authorities find regulatory violations that require us to undertake corrective action, suspend or terminate one or more sites, or prohibit us from using some or all of the data in support of our marketing applications; or\n\u25cf One or more IRBs suspends or terminates the trial at an investigational site, precludes enrollment of additional subjects, or withdraws its approval of the trial.\nOur development costs may increase if we have material delays in a clinical trials, or if we are required to modify, suspend, terminate or repeat a clinical trial. If we are unable to conduct our clinical trials properly and on schedule, marketing approval may be delayed or denied by the FDA, EMA, MOH and other regulatory authorities.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidates\u2019 claims or any additional claims we may seek for our product candidates and our clinical trials may result in the discovery of adverse side effects.\nEven if any clinical trial that we need to undertake is completed as planned, or if interim results from existing clinical trials are released, we cannot be certain that such results will support our product candidates claims or any new indications that we may seek for our products or that the FDA or foreign authorities will agree with our conclusions regarding the results of those trials. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our products or a product candidate is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use, which could cause us to stop seeking additional clearances or approvals for our product candidates. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of our regulatory submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize a product candidate. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate\u2019s profile.\nFavorable results from compassionate use treatment or initial interim results from a clinical trial do not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful and success in early-stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later-stage clinical trials.\nPLX cells have been administered as part of compassionate use treatments, which permit the administration of the PLX cells outside of clinical trials. No assurance can be given that any positive results are attributable to the PLX cells, or that administration of PLX cells to other patients will have positive results. Compassionate use is a term that is used to refer to the use of an investigational drug outside of a clinical trial to treat a patient with a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition who has no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. Regulators often allow compassionate use on a case-by-case basis for an individual patient or for defined groups of patients with similar treatment needs.\nSuccess in early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and initial results from a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. While results from treating patients through compassionate use have in certain cases been successful, we cannot be assured that further trials will ultimately be successful. Results of further clinical trials may be disappointing.\nEven if early-stage clinical trials are successful, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials for product candidates with patients receiving the drug for longer periods before we are able to seek approvals to market and sell these product candidates from the FDA and regulatory authorities outside the United States. Even if we are able to obtain approval for our product candidates through an accelerated approval review program, we may still be required to conduct clinical trials after such an approval. If we are not successful in commercializing any of our lead product candidates, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur product development programs are based on novel technologies and are inherently risky.\nWe are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on new technologies. The novel nature of our therapeutics creates significant challenges in regard to product development and optimization, manufacturing, government regulation, third party reimbursement and market acceptance. For example, the FDA, the EMA and other countries\u2019 regulatory authorities have relatively limited experience with cell therapies. Very few cell therapy products have been approved by regulatory authorities to date for commercial sale, and the pathway to regulatory approval for our cell therapy product candidates may accordingly be more complex and lengthier. As a result, the development and commercialization pathway for our therapies may be subject to increased uncertainty, as compared to the pathway for new conventional drugs.\nOur cell therapy drug candidates represent new classes of therapy that the marketplace may not understand or accept.\nEven if we successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our cell therapy candidates, the market may not understand or accept them. We are developing cell therapy product candidates that represent novel treatments and will compete with a number of more conventional products and therapies manufactured and marketed by others, including major pharmaceutical companies. The degree of market acceptance of any of our developed and potential products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the clinical safety and effectiveness of our cell therapy drug candidates and their perceived advantage over alternative treatment methods, if any;\n\u25cf adverse events involving our cell therapy product candidates or the products or product candidates of others that are cell-based; and\n\u25cf the cost of our products and the reimbursement policies of government and private third-party payers.\nIf the health care community does not accept our potential products for any of the foregoing reasons, or for any other reason, it could affect our sales, having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nInterim, \u201ctop-line,\u201d and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available or as additional analyses are conducted, and as the data are subject to audit and verification procedures, which could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publish interim, \u201ctop-line,\u201d or preliminary data from our clinical studies. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Preliminary or \u201ctop-line\u201d data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Material adverse changes between preliminary, \u201ctop-line,\u201d or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Food-Tech Business\nPlurinuva has a limited operating history in the field of cultivated meat to date and its prospects will be dependent on its ability to meet a number of challenges.\nPlurinuva\u2019s business prospects are difficult to predict due to its lack of operational history in the new and emerging food tech field, and its success will be dependent on its ability to meet a number of challenges. Because it has a limited operating history in the field of cultivated meat and it is in the early stages of development, Plurinuva may not be able to evaluate its future prospects accurately. Plurinuva's prospects will be primarily dependent on its ability to successfully develop industrial scale cultivated meat technologies and processes, and market these to its potential customers. If Plurinuva is not able to successfully meet these challenges, its prospects, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, Plurinuva will be subject to changing laws, rules and regulations in the Israeli, United States, Asia Pacific, the European Union and other jurisdictions relating to the food tech industry. Such laws and regulations may negatively impact its ability to expand its business and pursue business opportunities. Plurinuva may also incur significant expenses to comply with the laws, regulations and other obligations that will apply to it.\nPlurinuva is primarily focused on utilizing its technology for the development of cultivated meat , and it has limited data on the performance of our and its technologies in the field of cultivated meat to date.\nPlurinuva does not currently have any products or technologies approved for sale and it is still in the early stages of development. To date, Plurinuva has limited data on the ability of our and its technologies to successfully manufacture cultivated meat, towards which they have devoted substantial resources to date. Plurinuva\u2019s current technologies are, in large part, based on our technologies and intellectual property. We may not be successful in developing its technologies in a manner sufficient to support its expected scale-ups and future growth, or at all. Plurinuva expects that a substantial portion of its efforts and expenditures over the next few years will be devoted to the development of technologies designed to enable Plurinuva to market industrial-scale cultivated meat manufacturing processes. Plurinuva cannot guarantee that it will be successful in developing these technologies, based on its current roadmap , or at all. If Plurinuva is able to successfully develop its cultivated meat technologies, it cannot ensure that it will obtain regulatory approval or that, following approval, upon commercialization its technologies will achieve market acceptance. Any such delay or failure could materially and adversely affect Plurinuva's financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisk Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe may not successfully establish new collaborations, joint ventures or licensing arrangements, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nOne of the elements of our business strategy is to license our technology to other companies. Our business strategy includes development and in-house manufacturing of innovative new cell- based products and solutions powered by our 3D cell expansion technology platforms and establishing joint ventures and partnerships that leverage our cell expansion technology and cell-based product portfolio to expand product pipelines and meet cell-based manufacturing needs for a variety of industries. To date, we have a strategic partnership with Tnuva to use our technology to establish a cultivated food platform ,with CHA for both the IC and CLI indications in Korea and with Chart for the thawing device. Notwithstanding, we may not be able to further establish or maintain such licensing and collaboration arrangements necessary to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nEven if we are able to maintain or establish licensing or collaboration arrangements, these arrangements may not be on favorable terms and may contain provisions that will restrict our ability to develop, test and market our product candidates. Any failure to maintain or establish licensing or collaboration arrangements on favorable terms could adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition, or ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nOur agreements with our collaborators and licensees may have provisions that give rise to disputes regarding the rights and obligations of the parties. These and other possible disagreements could lead to termination of the agreement or delays in collaborative research, development, supply, or commercialization of certain product candidates, or could require or result in litigation or arbitration. Moreover, disagreements could arise with our collaborators over rights to intellectual property or our rights to share in any of the future revenues of products developed by our collaborators. These kinds of disagreements could result in costly and time-consuming litigation. Any such conflicts with our collaborators could reduce our ability to obtain future collaboration agreements and could have a negative impact on our relationship with existing collaborators.\nThe market for our cell therapy products will be heavily dependent on third party reimbursement policies.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our cell therapy product candidates will depend on the extent to which government healthcare programs, as well as private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payers will pay for our products and related treatments.\nReimbursement by third party payers depends on a number of factors, including the payer\u2019s determination that use of the product is safe and effective, not experimental, or investigational, medically necessary, appropriate for the specific patient and cost-effective. Reimbursement in the United States or foreign countries may not be available or maintained for any of our product candidates. If we do not obtain approvals for adequate third-party reimbursements, we may not be able to establish or maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Any limits on reimbursement from third party payers may reduce the demand for, or negatively affect the price of, our products. The lack of reimbursement for these procedures by insurance payers has negatively affected the market for our products in this indication in the past.\nManaging and reducing health care costs has been a general concern of federal and state governments in the United States and of foreign governments. In addition, third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, and many limit reimbursement for newly approved health care products. In particular, third-party payers may limit the indications for which they will reimburse patients who use any products that we may develop. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price for products that we may develop, which would result in lower product revenues to us.\nRisk Related to Intellectual Property\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to develop and protect our technology and our cell therapy products. If our patents and proprietary rights agreements do not provide sufficient protection for our technology and our cell therapy products, our business and competitive position will suffer.\nOur success will also depend in part on our ability to develop our technology and commercialize cell therapy products without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We have not conducted full freedom of use patent searches and no assurance can be given that patents do not exist or could not be filed which would have an adverse effect on our ability to develop our technology or maintain our competitive position with respect to our potential cell therapy products. If our technology components, devices, designs, products, processes or other subject matter are claimed under other existing United States or foreign patents or are otherwise protected by third party proprietary rights, we may be subject to infringement actions. In such event, we may challenge the validity of such patents or other proprietary rights, or we may be required to obtain licenses from such companies in order to develop, manufacture or market our technology or products. There can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain such licenses or that such licenses, if available, could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, the failure to either develop a commercially viable alternative or obtain such licenses could result in delays in marketing our proposed products or the inability to proceed with the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are required to defend ourselves against charges of patent infringement or to protect our proprietary rights against third parties, substantial costs will be incurred regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings are typically protracted with no certainty of success. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and force us to curtail or cease our development of our technology and the commercialization our potential cell therapy products.\nWe have built the ability to manufacture clinical grade adherent stromal cells in-house. Through our experience with adherent stromal cell-based product development, we have developed expertise and know-how in this field. To protect these expertise and know-how, our policies require confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers and advisors. These agreements generally provide for protection of confidential information, restrictions on the use of materials and assignment of inventions conceived during the course of performance for us. These agreements might not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We have yet to conduct comprehensive freedom-to-operate searches to determine whether our proposed business activities or use of certain of the patent rights owned by us would infringe patents issued to third parties. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nEven if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. For example, we are aware of issued third party patents directed to placental stem cells and their use for therapy and in treating various diseases. We may need to seek a license for one or more of these patents. No assurances can be given that such a license will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common shares. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors are able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nThe patent approval process is complex, and we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications or future patent applications will be approved.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and any future licensors\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and we may not be able to obtain meaningful patent protection for any of our commercial products either in or outside the United States.\nNo assurance can be given that the scope of any patent protection granted will exclude competitors or provide us with competitive advantages, that any of the patents that have been or may be issued to us will be held valid if subsequently challenged, or that other parties will not claim rights to or ownership of our patents or other proprietary rights that we hold. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others have not developed or will not develop similar products, duplicate any of our technology or products or design around any patents that have been or may be issued to us or any future licensors. Since patent applications in the United States and in Europe are not publicly disclosed until patents are issued, there can be no assurance that others did not first file applications for products covered by our pending patent applications, nor can we be certain that we will not infringe any patents that may be issued to others.\nRisk Related to Our Common Shares\nThe price of our common shares may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market for our common shares may fluctuate significantly. A number of events and factors may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common shares, such as:\n\u25cf results of our clinical trials or adverse events associated with our products;\n\u25cf the amount of our cash resources and our ability to obtain additional funding;\n\u25cf changes in our revenues, expense levels or operating results;\n\u25cf entering into or terminating strategic relationships;\n\u25cf announcements of technical or product developments by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology shares in particular;\n\u25cf changes in laws and governmental regulations, including changes in tax, healthcare, competition and patent laws;\n\u25cf disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights;\n\u25cf new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings;\n\u25cf public announcements regarding medical advances in the treatment of the disease states that we are targeting;\n\u25cf patent or proprietary rights developments;\n\u25cf regulatory actions that may impact our products;\n\u25cf future sales of our common shares, or the perception of such sales;\n\u25cf disruptions in our manufacturing processes; and\n\u25cf competition.\nIn addition, a global pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and a market downturn in general and/or in the biopharmaceutical sector in particular, may adversely affect the market price of our securities, which may not necessarily reflect the actual or perceived value of our Company.\nWe could fail to maintain the listing of our common shares on Nasdaq, which could seriously harm the liquidity of our shares and our ability to raise capital or complete a strategic transaction.\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market has established continued listing requirements, including a requirement to maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share. If a company trades for 30 consecutive business days below such minimum closing bid price, it will receive a deficiency notice from Nasdaq. Assuming it is in compliance with the other continued listing requirements, Nasdaq would provide such company a period of 180 calendar days in which to regain compliance by maintaining a closing bid price at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. If we are not able to regain compliance, there is a risk that our common shares may be delisted from Nasdaq.\nAs of the date of this filing, our common shares are trading below $1.00 per share. If the closing bid price of our common shares continues trading below $1.00 per share for an aggregate of 30 consecutive business days, we will receive a deficiency notice from Nasdaq. If, in such circumstance, we are not able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement within 180 days, our common shares will be subject to a delisting action by Nasdaq.\nA delisting from Nasdaq would likely result in a reduction in some or all of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on shareholders:\n\u25cf the liquidity of our common shares;\n\u25cf the market price of our common shares;\n\u25cf the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common shares;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain financing or complete a strategic transaction;\n\u25cf the number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in our common shares; and\n\u25cf the number of market markers or broker-dealers for our common shares.\nFuture sales of our common shares may cause dilution.\nFuture sales of our common shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause immediate dilution and adversely affect the market price of our common shares. If we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders may be reduced, and accordingly these shareholders may experience substantial dilution. We may also issue equity securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common shares. Given our need for cash and that equity raising is the most common type of fundraising for companies like ours, the risk of dilution is particularly significant for shareholders of our company.\nRisks Related to Foreign Exchange Rates\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nA significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States. Therefore, we are exposed to currency exchange fluctuations in other currencies such as the NIS and the Euro. A significant portion of our expenses in Israel are paid in NIS, and we have also received \u20ac20 million pursuant to the EIB Finance Agreement, that bears 4% annual interest. All of these factors subject us to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations. Our primary expenses paid in NIS are employee salaries, and lease payments on our facilities. From time to time, we may apply a hedging strategy by using options and forward contracts to protect ourselves against some of the risks of currency exchange fluctuations and we are actively monitoring the exchange rate differences of the NIS, Euro and U.S. Dollar; however, we are still exposed to potential losses from currency exchange fluctuation.\nOur cash may be subject to a risk of loss, and we may be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.\nOur assets include a significant component of cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits. We adhere to an investment policy set by our investment committee which aims to preserve our financial assets, maintain adequate liquidity and maximize returns. We believe that our cash is held in institutions whose credit risk is minimal and that the value and liquidity of our deposits are accurately reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2022. Currently, we hold most of our cash assets in bank deposits. However, nearly all of our cash and bank deposits are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC, or similar governmental deposit insurance outside the United States. Therefore, our cash and any bank deposits that we now hold or may acquire in the future may be subject to risks, including the risk of loss or of reduced value or liquidity, particularly in light of the increased volatility and worldwide pressures in the financial and banking sectors.\nOther Risks\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, may materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nCOVID-19 has had and continues to have a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. We are actively monitoring any developments regarding the pandemic, and we are taking any necessary measures to respond to the situation in cooperation with the various stakeholders.\nCOVID-19 infection of our workforce could result in a temporary disruption in our business activities, including manufacturing and other functions. Based on guidelines provided by the Israeli Government, we have increased as much as possible the capacity and arrangement for employees to work remotely, and although the vast majority of our employees have been vaccinated and we have adopted hybrid working models to minimize exposure, we cannot guaranty that there will be no infection and spread of the virus among our employees and staff.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is also affecting the United States, Israel and global economies and has affected, and may continue to affect, the conduct of our clinical trials and may in the future affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely, including by causing disruptions in our raw material supply. In that regard, to date we have experienced delays in enrolling patients in our various studies due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the operations of the FDA and other health authorities, which could result in delays of reviews and approvals, including with respect to our Phase III clinical trial related to muscle recovery following surgery for hip fracture. The evolving COVID-19 pandemic has already impacted, and may continue to, directly or indirectly impact the pace of enrollment in our clinical trials as patients may avoid or may not be able to travel to healthcare facilities and physicians\u2019 offices unless due to a health emergency and clinical trial staff may not be able to physically arrive to the clinical sites. Additionally, such facilities and offices have been and may continue to be required to focus limited resources on non-clinical trial matters, including treatment of COVID-19 patients, thereby decreasing availability, in whole or in part, for clinical trial services. Additionally, the stock market has been unusually volatile during the COVID-19 outbreak and such volatility may continue. To date, during certain periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, our share price fluctuated significantly, and such fluctuation may continue to occur.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, financing or clinical trial activities, or on healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole if the pandemic continues for an extended period of time or significantly worsens. However, these effects could have a material impact on our liquidity, capital resources, operations and business and those of the third parties on which we rely.\nSince we received grants from the IIA, we are subject to on-going restrictions.\nWe have received royalty-bearing grants from the IIA, for research and development programs that meet specified criteria. The terms of the IIA\u2019s grants limit our ability to transfer know-how developed under an approved research and development program outside of Israel, regardless of whether the royalties are fully paid. Any non-Israeli citizen, resident or entity that, among other things, becomes a holder of 5% or more of our share capital or voting rights, is entitled to appoint one or more of our directors or our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, serves as a director of our Company or as our CEO is generally required to notify the same to the IIA and to undertake to observe the law governing the grant programs of the IIA, the principal restrictions of which are the transferability limits described above. For more information, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nRecent increasing global inflation may adversely affect our business results.\nThe increasing inflation could affect our ability to purchase materials needed to support our research and operational activities, which in turn could result in higher burn rate and a higher end price of our future products. As a result, we may not be able to effectively develop our product candidates or cultivated meat products. If we are not able to successfully manage any increases in inflation, our prospects, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nSince we have signed the EIB Finance Agreement, we agreed to guaranty the loan as well as agreed to limitations that require us to notify the EIB, and in some cases obtain their approval, before we engage with other banks for additional sources of funding or with potential partners for certain strategic activities.\nThe EIB Finance Agreement contains certain limitations that we must adhere to such as the use of proceeds received from the EIB, the disposal of assets, substantive changes in the nature of our business, our potential execution of mergers and acquisitions, changes in our holding structure, distributions of future potential dividends and our engaging with other banks and financing entities for other loans.\nOur principal research and development and manufacturing facilities are located in Israel and the unstable military and political conditions of Israel may cause interruption or suspension of our business operations without warning.\nOur principal research and development and manufacturing facilities are located in Israel. As a result, we are directly influenced by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. During June 2021, July and August 2014 and November 2012, Israel was engaged in an armed conflict with a militia group and political party which controls the Gaza Strip, and during the summer of 2006, Israel was engaged in an armed conflict with Hezbollah, a Lebanese Islamist Shiite militia group and political party. These conflicts involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, including areas in which our employees and some of our consultants are located, and negatively affected business conditions in Israel. We cannot predict if or when armed conflict will take place and the duration of each conflict.\nFurthermore, certain of our employees may be obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called up for active military duty at any time. All Israeli male citizens who have served in the army are required to perform reserve duty until they are between 40 and 49 years old, depending upon the nature of their military service.\nIn addition, Israeli-based companies and companies doing business with Israel, have been the subject of an economic boycott by members of the Arab League and certain other predominantly Muslim countries since Israel\u2019s establishment. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with certain Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority, and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the Middle East, we cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved. Wars and acts of terrorism have resulted in significant damage to the Israeli economy, including reducing the level of foreign and local investment.\nRisk Related to Our Industry\nThe trend towards consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may adversely affect us.\nThere is a trend towards consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. This consolidation trend may result in the remaining companies having greater financial resources and technical discovery capabilities, thus intensifying competition in these industries. This trend may also result in fewer potential collaborators or licensees for our therapeutic product candidates. Also, if a consolidating company is already doing business with our competitors, we may lose existing licensees or collaborators as a result of such consolidation. This trend may adversely affect our ability to enter into license agreements or agreements for the development and commercialization of our product candidates, and as a result may materially harm our business.\nIf we do not keep pace with our competitors and with technological and market changes, our technology and products may become obsolete, and our business may suffer.\nThe cellular therapeutics industry, of which we are a part, is very competitive and is subject to technological changes that can be rapid and intense. We have faced, and will continue to face, intense competition from biotechnology, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, academic and research institutions and governmental agencies engaged in cellular therapeutic and drug discovery activities or funding, both in the United States and internationally. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of cellular therapeutics, drugs and other therapies that target the same diseases and conditions that we target in our clinical and pre-clinical programs.\nSome of our competitors have greater resources, more product candidates and have developed product candidates and processes that directly compete with our products. Our competitors may have developed, or could develop in the future, new products that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete.\nPotential product liability claims could adversely affect our future earnings and financial condition.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in adverse effects. We may not be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance for these liabilities at reasonable cost and/or reasonable terms. Excessive insurance costs or uninsured claims would add to our future operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition.\nRisk Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe are dependent upon third party suppliers for raw materials needed to manufacture PLX; if any of these third parties fails or is unable to perform in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture and deliver will be compromised.\nIn addition to the placenta used in the clinical manufacturing process of PLX, we require certain raw materials. These items must be manufactured and supplied to us in sufficient quantities and in compliance with current GMP. To meet these requirements, we have entered into supply agreements with firms that manufacture these raw materials to current GMP standards. Our requirements for these items are expected to increase if and when we transition to the manufacture of commercial quantities of our cell-based drug candidates.\nIn addition, as we proceed with our clinical trial efforts, we must be able to continuously demonstrate to the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities that we can manufacture our cell therapy product candidates with consistent characteristics. Accordingly, we are materially dependent on these suppliers for supply of current GMP-grade materials of consistent quality. Our ability to complete ongoing clinical trials may be negatively affected in the event that we are forced to seek and validate a replacement source for any of these critical materials.\nWe intend to decrease our dependency in third party suppliers for raw materials. To that effect we have developed a serum-free formulation which is expected to support the manufacturing of cell therapy products. This serum-free formulation was developed using our deep understanding in cell therapy industrial scale production standards, and the quality methods designed to support implementation in Phase III development and marketing. Achieving this significant technological challenge is expected to provide us with large-scale, highly consistent production with operational independency from third party suppliers for standard serum, an expensive and quantity limited product. There can be no guarantee that we will successfully implement the use of our serum-free formulation to support the manufacturing of cell therapy products or any other future product candidates, if any, that we seek to produce using such formulation, or that such implementation of the serum-free formulation will decrease our dependency on third party suppliers for raw materials.\nWe rely and will continue to rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe depend and will depend upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities, medical institutions, CROs, vendors and strategic partners to conduct our pre-clinical and clinical trials under agreements with us. We negotiate budgets and contracts with CROs, vendors and study sites which may result in delays to our development timelines and increased costs. We rely heavily on these third parties over the course of our clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and these third parties are required to comply with current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development.\nRegulatory authorities enforce these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable cGCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the cGCP regulations. In addition, any Phase III clinical trials which we may conduct must be conducted with biologic product produced under cGMP and may require a large number of test patients. Biologic products for commercial purposes must also be produced under cGMP. Our failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws and regulations.\nAny third parties conducting our clinical trials are not and will not be our employees and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, which in some instances may be limited, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing pre-clinical, clinical and nonclinical programs. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other drug development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they declare bankruptcy or if they need to be replaced for whatever reason or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed. Switching or adding third parties to conduct our clinical trials involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new third party commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines.\nA cybersecurity incident, other technology disruptions or failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy and the protection of data relating to individuals could negatively impact our business and our reputation.\nWe rely on and utilize services provided by third parties in connection with our clinical trials, which services involve the collection, use, storage and analysis of personal health information. While we receive assurances from these vendors that their services are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and other applicable privacy laws, there can be no assurance that such third parties will comply with applicable laws or regulations. Non-compliance by such vendors may result in liability for us which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nDuring November 2021, we experienced a cybersecurity incident in which one or more third parties were able to impersonate one of our vendors by using a falsified email domain account and asked to make a payment to a false bank account. As a result of this incident, the third parties managed to extract a sum of approximately $616,000 from us. Following the incident, we hired the services of a cybersecurity investigation firm to fully access the incident and notified the appropriate government authorities, including the banks involved in the transaction. During February 2022, with the assistance of local and global law enforcement agencies, we were able to recover an amount of approximately $412,000 from the false bank account. Together with the reimbursement received from our insurance company, we were able to recover the full amount lost.\nThe cybersecurity incident has not had any material effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations, including our ability to carry out our operations and business activities, and our investigation has confirmed that, other than the funds referenced above, none of our information or data was stolen or damaged. Nonetheless, despite the implementation of security measures, including the steps we have taken following the November 2021 cybersecurity incident, our internal computer systems and those of our current and future CROs and other contractors and consultants may not prevent future incidents of a similar nature or other cyber-attacks. We are constantly exploring new and advanced security protection measures to prevent future cybersecurity incidents.\nFuture security breaches or any material system failure events could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nIn addition, we are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the Israeli, United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions relating to the collection, use and security of personal information and data. Such data privacy laws, regulations and other obligations may require us to change our business practices and may negatively impact our ability to expand our business and pursue business opportunities. We may incur significant expenses to comply with the laws, regulations and other obligations that apply to us. Additionally, the privacy- and data protection-related laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to significant change. Several jurisdictions have passed new laws and regulations in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. Privacy- and data protection-related laws and regulations also may be interpreted and enforced inconsistently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Any actual or perceived inability to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations, or other obligations could result in significant cost and liability, litigation or governmental investigations, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business.\nUnsuccessful compliance with certain European privacy regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nThe collection and use of personal health data in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The GPDR also extends the geographical scope of European Union data protection law to non-European Union entities under certain conditions, tightens existing European Union data protection principles and creates new obligations for companies and new rights for individuals. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. There may be circumstances under which a failure to comply with GDPR, or the exercise of individual rights under the GDPR, would limit our ability to utilize clinical trial data collected on certain subjects. The GDPR regulations impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we intend to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with these and/or new data protection rules.\nChanges to these European privacy regulations and unsuccessful compliance may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and reputation.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or FCPA, and other laws that prohibit U.S. companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official or political party for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage. We have operations and agreements with third parties. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized and illegal payments or offers of payments by our employees or consultants, even though they may not always be subject to our control. We discourage these practices by our employees and consultants. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees or consultants, may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible for Any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures and ensure that our employees and consultants comply with the FCPA and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nViolations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.", "PERMNO": 92468, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PSTI"}
