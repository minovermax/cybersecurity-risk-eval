{"cik": "1166003", "company": "XPO Logistics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the SEC or in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public. You should carefully consider the following factors in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8.\nEconomic recessions and other factors that reduce freight volumes, both in North America and Europe, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe transportation industry in North America and Europe historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recessions, downturns in the business cycles of our customers, increases in the prices charged by third-party carriers, interest rate fluctuations, changes in international trade policies and other U.S. and global economic factors beyond our control. During economic downturns, a reduction in overall demand for transportation services will likely reduce demand for our services and exert downward pressures on our rates and margins. In addition, in periods of strong economic growth, overall demand may exceed the available supply of transportation resources, resulting in increased network congestion and operating inefficiencies. Additional changes in international trade policies and relations could significantly reduce the volume of goods transported globally and adversely affect our business and results of operations. These factors subject our business to various risks that may have a material impact on our operating results and future prospects. These risks may include the following:\n\u2022\nA reduction in overall freight volume reduces our opportunities for growth. In addition, if a downturn in our customers\u2019 business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, our operating results could be adversely affected;\n\u2022\nSome of our customers may experience financial distress, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their business and may be unable to pay us. In addition, some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past, causing our working capital needs to increase;\n\u2022\nThe U.S. government has made significant changes in U.S. trade policy and has taken certain actions that have negatively impacted U.S. trade, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the U.S. To date, several governments, including the EU, have imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from the U.S. These actions contributed to weakness in the global economy that could adversely affect our results of operations, and such weakness could continue in 2020. Any further changes in U.S. or international trade policy could trigger additional retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \u201ctrade wars\u201d and further increased costs for goods transported globally, which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay those tariffs increase their prices, or in trading partners limiting their trade with countries that impose anti-trade measures. Such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nA significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment capacity or services to meet our commitments to our customers; and\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to rapid changes in market demand. In order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels when market demand changes. In periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business\nneeds. In addition, we have other expenses that are primarily variable but are fixed for a period of time, as well as certain significant fixed expenses; we may be unable to adequately adjust these expenses to match a rapid change in demand.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and, if we are unable to adequately address factors that may adversely affect our revenue and costs, our business could suffer.\nCompetition in the transportation services industry is intense. Increased competition may lead to a reduction in revenues, reduced profit margins, or a loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business. There are many factors that could impair our profitability, including the following:\n\u2022\nCompetition from other transportation services companies, some of which offer different services or have a broader coverage network, more fully developed information technology systems and greater capital resources than we do;\n\u2022\nA reduction in the rates charged by our competitors to gain business, especially during times of declining economic growth, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase our rates, maintain our operating margins or achieve significant growth in our business;\n\u2022\nShippers soliciting bids from multiple transportation providers for their shipping needs, which may result in the depression of freight rates or loss of business to competitors;\n\u2022\nThe establishment by our competitors of cooperative relationships to increase their ability to address shipper needs;\n\u2022\nDecisions by our current or prospective customers to develop or expand internal capabilities for some of the services we provide; and\n\u2022\nThe development of new technologies or business models that could result in our disintermediation in certain services we provide.\nOur profitability may be materially adversely impacted if our investments in equipment, service centers and warehouses do not match customer demand for these resources or if there is a decline in the availability of funding sources for these investments.\nOur LTL and full truckload operations require significant investments in equipment and freight service centers. The amount and timing of our capital investments depend on various factors, including anticipated freight volume levels and the price and availability of appropriate property for service centers and newly manufactured tractors. If our anticipated requirements for service centers or fleet differ materially from actual usage, our capital-intensive operations, specifically LTL and full truckload, may have more or less capacity than is optimal.\nOur contract logistics operations can require a significant commitment of capital in the form of shelving, racking and other warehousing systems that may be required to implement warehouse-management services for our customers. To the extent that a customer defaults on its obligations under its agreement with us, we could be forced to take a significant loss on the unrecovered portion of this capital cost.\nOur investments in equipment and service centers depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and our access to credit, debt and equity capital markets. A decline in the availability of these funding sources could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur exploration of strategic alternatives is subject to various risks and uncertainties, may not result in any completed transactions and will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.\nOn January 15, 2020, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a review of strategic alternatives, including the possible sale or spin-off of one or more of our business units. Whether or not any such transaction or transactions are completed, our business may face significant risks, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nThe diversion of management\u2019s attention from operating our ongoing businesses and the overall impact on our businesses because of management\u2019s attention to the review of strategic alternatives;\n\u2022\nPotential difficulty in maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;\n\u2022\nPotential difficulty in separating assets related to such businesses from the businesses we retain;\n\u2022\nThe need to obtain regulatory approvals and other third-party consents, which could potentially disrupt customer and supplier relationships;\n\u2022\nForeseen and unforeseen dis-synergy costs, costs of restructuring transactions (including taxes) and other significant costs and expenses; and\n\u2022\nPotential negative reactions from the financial markets if we do not complete one or more transactions.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or the price of our common stock.\nIf one or more business units is sold or spun off, we will be a smaller, less diversified company than we are today.\nA sale or spin-off of one or more of our business units will result in us being a smaller, less diversified company with a more concentrated area of focus. Following a potential sale or spin-off, we will be reliant on our remaining business units. As a result, we may become more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The diversification of our revenues, costs and cash flows will diminish as a result of a sale or spin-off, such that our results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and our ability to fund capital expenditures, investments and service our debt may be diminished. We may also incur ongoing costs and retain certain liabilities that were previously allocated to entities that were sold or spun off. Those costs may exceed our estimates or could diminish the benefits we expect to realize.\nOur past acquisitions, as well as any acquisitions that we may complete in the future, may be unsuccessful or result in other risks or developments that adversely affect our financial condition and results.\nWhile we intend for our acquisitions to improve our competitiveness and profitability, we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our operational or strategic expectations. Special risks, including accounting, regulatory, compliance, information technology or human resources issues, may arise in connection with, or as a result of, the acquisition of an existing company, including the assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, possible management distractions, or the inability of the acquired business to achieve the levels of revenue, profit, productivity or synergies we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect on the timeline contemplated. We are unable to predict all of the risks that could arise as a result of our acquisitions.\nIf the performance of our reporting segments or an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions, or if estimates about the future profitability of our reporting segments or an acquired business change, our revenues, earnings or other aspects of our financial condition could be adversely affected. We may also experience difficulties in connection with integrating any acquired companies into our existing businesses and operations, including our existing infrastructure and information technology systems. The infrastructure and information technology systems of acquired companies could present issues that we were unable to identify prior to the acquisition and that could adversely affect our financial condition and results; we have experienced challenges of this nature relating to the infrastructure and systems of certain past companies that we acquired. Also, we may not realize all of the synergies we anticipate from past and potential future acquisitions. Among the synergies that we currently expect to realize are cross-selling opportunities to our existing customers, network synergies and other operational synergies. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not successfully manage our growth.\nWe have grown rapidly and substantially over prior years, including by expanding our internal resources, making acquisitions and entering into new markets, and we intend to continue to focus on rapid growth, including organic growth and additional acquisitions. We may experience difficulties and higher-than-expected expenses in executing this strategy as a result of unfamiliarity with new markets, changes in revenue and business models, entry into new geographic areas and increased pressure on our existing infrastructure and information technology systems.\nOur growth will place a significant strain on our management, operational, financial and information technology resources. We will need to continually improve existing procedures and controls, as well as implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, and procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our employee base. Our working capital needs will continue to increase as our operations grow. Failure to manage our growth effectively, or obtain necessary working capital, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur business will be seriously harmed if we fail to develop, implement, maintain, upgrade, enhance, protect and integrate our information technology systems, including those systems of any businesses that we acquire.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems in managing our business; they are a key component of our customer-facing services and internal growth strategy. In general, we expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated, fully integrated technology from their transportation and logistics providers. To keep pace with changing technologies and customer demands, we must correctly address market trends and enhance the features and functionality of our proprietary technology platform in response to these trends. This process of continuous enhancement may lead to significant ongoing software development costs, which will continue to increase if we pursue new acquisitions of companies and their current systems. In addition, we may fail to accurately determine the needs of our customers or trends in the transportation and logistics industries, or we may fail to respond appropriately by implementing functionality for our technology platform in a timely or cost-effective manner. Any such failures could result in decreased demand for our services and a corresponding decrease in our revenues.\nWe must ensure that our information technology systems remain competitive. If our information technology systems are unable to manage high volumes with reliability, accuracy and speed as we grow, or if such systems are not suited to manage the various services we offer, our service levels and operating efficiency could decline. In addition, if we fail to hire and retain qualified personnel to implement, protect and maintain our information technology systems, or if we fail to enhance our systems to meet our customers\u2019 needs, our results of operations could be seriously harmed. This could result in a loss of customers or a decline in the volume of freight we receive from customers.\nWe are developing proprietary information technology for both of our business segments. Our technology may not be successful or may not achieve the desired results and we may require additional training or different personnel to successfully implement this technology. Our technology development process may be subject to cost overruns or delays in obtaining the expected results, which may result in disruptions to our operations.\nA failure of our information technology infrastructure or a breach of our information security systems, networks or processes may materially adversely affect our business.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our sales and marketing, financial, legal and compliance functions, engineering and product development tasks, research and development data, communications, logistics order entry and fulfillment and other business processes. We also rely on third parties and virtualized infrastructure to operate our information technology systems. Despite significant testing for risk management, external and internal risks, such as malware, insecure coding, \u201cActs of God,\u201d data leakage and human error, pose a direct threat to the stability or effectiveness of our information technology systems and operations. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate has in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect our business through transaction errors, billing and invoicing errors, internal recordkeeping and reporting errors, processing inefficiencies and loss of sales, receivables collection or customers. Any such failure could result in harm to our reputation and have an ongoing adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including after the underlying failures have been remedied.\nWe may also be subject to cybersecurity attacks and other intentional hacking. Any failure to identify and address such defects or errors or prevent a cyber-attack could result in service interruptions, operational difficulties, loss of revenues or market share, liability to our customers or others, the diversion of corporate resources, injury to our reputation or increased service and maintenance costs. Addressing such issues could prove to be impossible or very costly and responding to the resulting claims or liability could similarly involve substantial cost. In addition, recently, regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection has heightened in the U.S. and abroad, particularly in the EU, and failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection\nstandards may expose us to litigation, fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could harm our business, its reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have substantial outstanding indebtedness, which could:\n\u2022\nNegatively affect our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt or dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nIncrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nLimit our ability to fund future capital expenditures and working capital, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of interest and principal or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt;\n\u2022\nLimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nImpair our ability to obtain additional financing or to refinance our indebtedness in the future; and\n\u2022\nPlace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with the covenants under our indebtedness may have a material adverse impact on our operations. If we fail to comply with any of the covenants under our indebtedness, and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, such failure may result in an event of default under our indebtedness. We may not have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance our indebtedness if such indebtedness were accelerated upon an event of default.\nUnder the terms of our outstanding indebtedness, we may not be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nThe execution of our strategy could depend on our ability to raise capital in the future, and our inability to do so could prevent us from achieving our growth objectives.\nWe may in the future be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements in order to pursue our growth strategy or operate our businesses. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business or our ability to execute our strategy. Further debt financing may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\nFailure to successfully implement our cost and revenue initiatives could cause our future financial results to suffer.\nWe are implementing various cost and revenue initiatives to further improve our profitability. We estimate that 40% of the potential opportunity is related to revenue initiatives: advanced pricing analytics and revenue management tools, our digital freight platform, our shared distribution network and cross-selling to strategic accounts in Europe. The other 60% is related to cost initiatives: LTL process improvements, contract logistics automation, workforce productivity, European margin expansion, global procurement and further back-office optimization. If we are not able to successfully implement these cost and revenue initiatives, our future financial results may suffer.\nWe depend on third parties in the operation of our business.\nIn our global forwarding, last mile and freight brokerage operations, we do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers\u2019 freight, and we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering this freight. In addition, in our freight brokerage businesses (particularly our over-the-road expedite operations and intermodal drayage operations) and in our last mile business, we engage independent contractors who own and\noperate their own equipment. Accordingly, we are dependent on third parties to provide truck, rail, ocean, air and other transportation services and to report certain events to us, including delivery information and cargo claims. This reliance on third parties could cause delays in reporting certain events, impacting our ability to recognize revenue and claims in a timely manner.\nOur inability to maintain positive relationships with independent transportation providers could significantly limit our ability to serve our customers on competitive terms. If we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers or provide our services on competitive terms, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected, and our customers could shift their business to our competitors temporarily or permanently. Our ability to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to customers or provide our services on competitive terms is subject to inherent risks, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nEquipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers and railroads;\n\u2022\nInterruptions or stoppages in transportation services as a result of labor disputes, seaport strikes, network congestion, weather-related issues, \u201cActs of God\u201d or acts of terrorism;\n\u2022\nChanges in regulations impacting transportation;\n\u2022\nIncreases in operating expenses for carriers, such as fuel costs, insurance premiums and licensing expenses, that result in a reduction in available carriers; and\n\u2022\nChanges in transportation rates.\nIncreases in driver compensation and difficulties with attracting and retaining drivers could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur LTL services in North America and Europe and our full truckload services in Europe are conducted primarily with employee drivers. Our industry has periodically experienced and may, in future, experience intense competition for qualified drivers in the transportation industry due to a shortage of drivers. The availability of qualified drivers may be affected from time to time by changing workforce demographics, competition from other transportation companies and industries for employees, the availability and affordability of driver training schools, changing industry regulations, and the demand for drivers in the labor market. If the current industry-wide shortage of qualified drivers continues, our global LTL operations and our European truckload operation will likely experience difficulty in attracting and retaining enough qualified drivers to fully satisfy customer demand. During periods of increased competition in the labor market for drivers, our LTL and full truckload operations may be required to increase driver compensation and benefits in the future or face difficulty meeting customer demand, all of which could adversely affect our profitability. Additionally, a shortage of drivers could result in the underutilization of our truck fleet, lost revenue, increased costs for purchased transportation or increased costs for driver recruitment.\nIncreases in independent contractor driver rates or other necessities in attracting and retaining qualified independent contractor drivers could adversely affect our profitability and ability to replenish or grow our independent contractor driver networks.\nOur freight brokerage and intermodal operations rely on fleets of vehicles that are owned and operated by independent contractors. Our last mile service is also performed by independent contract carriers who supply their own vehicles, drivers and helpers. These independent contractors are responsible for maintaining and operating their own equipment and paying their own fuel, insurance, licenses and other operating costs. Turnover and bankruptcy among independent contractor drivers often limit the pool of qualified independent contractor drivers and increase competition for their services. In addition, regulations such as the FMCSA Compliance Safety Accountability program may further reduce the pool of qualified independent contractor drivers. Thus, our continued reliance on independent contractor drivers could limit our ability to grow our ground transportation networks.\nWe are currently experiencing difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified independent contractor drivers, and we expect to continue to experience this difficulty from time to time in the future. Additionally, our agreements with independent contractor drivers are terminable by either party without penalty and upon short notice. Consequently, we need to regularly recruit new, qualified independent contractor drivers to\nreplace those who have left our networks. If we are unable to retain our existing independent contractor drivers or recruit new independent contractor drivers, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe rates we offer our independent contractor drivers are subject to market conditions and we may find it necessary to continue to increase independent contractor drivers\u2019 rates in future periods. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of independent contractor drivers, we could be required to increase our mileage rates and accessorial pay or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting shipper demands, all of which would adversely affect our profitability and scale, or our ability to pursue our growth strategy.\nOur business may be materially adversely affected by labor disputes.\nOur business in the past has been, and in the future could be, adversely affected by strikes and labor negotiations at seaports, labor disputes between railroads and their union employees, or by a work stoppage at one or more railroads or local trucking companies servicing rail or port terminals, including work disruptions involving owner-operators under contract with our local trucking operations. Port shutdowns and similar disruptions to major points in national or international transportation networks, most of which are beyond our control, could result in terminal embargoes, disrupt equipment and freight flows, depress volumes and revenues, increase costs and have other negative effects on our operations and financial results.\nLabor disputes involving our customers could affect our operations. If our customers experience plant slowdowns or closures because they are unable to negotiate labor contracts, our revenue and profitability could be negatively impacted. In particular, our Logistics segment derives a substantial portion of its revenue from the operation and management of facilities that are often located in close proximity to a customer\u2019s manufacturing plant and are integrated into the customer\u2019s production line process. If any of our customers are affected by labor disputes and consequently cease or significantly modify their operations at a plant served by our Logistics segment, we may experience significant revenue loss and shutdown costs, including costs related to early termination of leases, causing our business to suffer.\nXPO Logistics Europe\u2019s business activities require a large amount of labor, which represents one of its most significant costs. It is essential that we maintain good relations with employees, trade unions and other staff representative institutions. A deteriorating economic environment may result in tensions in industrial relations, which may lead to industrial action within our European operations; this could have a direct impact on our business operations. Generally, any deterioration in industrial relations in our European operations, such as general strike activities or other material labor disputes, could have an adverse effect on our revenues, earnings, financial position and outlook.\nEfforts by labor organizations to organize employees at certain locations in North America, if successful, may result in increased costs and decreased efficiencies at those locations.\nSince 2014, in the U.S., the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\u201cTeamsters\u201d) has attempted to organize employees at several of our LTL and logistics locations, and the International Association of Machinists (\u201cMachinists\u201d) has attempted to organize a small number of mechanics at three LTL maintenance shops. In 2018, the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (\u201cUAW\u201d) attempted to organize warehouse workers at one logistics location. The majority of our employees involved in these organizing efforts rejected union representation. As of January 1, 2020, our employees had voted in favor of union representation in 10 of the 25 union elections held since 2014, with approximately 545 employees voting in favor and 602 employees voting against representation. In October 2017, a majority of employees at our North Haven, Connecticut logistics location, which had previously voted for Teamsters representation, petitioned us to withdraw recognition of the Teamsters as the employees\u2019 representative and we withdrew this recognition. Similarly, in 2019, a majority of employees at our LTL locations in Laredo, Texas and Aurora, Illinois, voted to decertify the Teamsters as the employees\u2019 representative. In addition, we continue to challenge the results of one election held in 2014 for an LTL location in Los Angeles, California pursuant to a petition that had been filed by the Teamsters, while seven locations where employees had voted in favor of union representation are in negotiations for an initial collective bargaining agreement. Since 2014, the Teamsters have withdrawn six petitions seeking elections on behalf of approximately 230 LTL employees prior to the election being held, and the Machinists withdrew one petition for an LTL election on behalf of six individuals. We cannot predict with certainty whether further organizing efforts may result in the unionization of any additional locations in the U.S. If successful, these efforts may result in increased costs and\ndecreased efficiencies at the specific locations where representation is elected. We do not expect the impact, if any, to extend to our larger organization or the services provided to our customer base.\nCertain of our businesses rely on owner-operators and contract carriers to conduct their operations, and the status of these parties as independent contractors, rather than employees, is being challenged.\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including putative class action lawsuits, multi-plaintiff and individual lawsuits, and state tax and other administrative proceedings that claim that our contract carriers or owner-operators or their drivers should be treated as our employees, rather than independent contractors, or that certain of our drivers were not paid for all compensable time or were not provided with required meal or rest breaks. These lawsuits and proceedings may seek substantial monetary damages (including claims for unpaid wages, overtime, failure to provide meal and rest periods, unreimbursed business expenses and other items), injunctive relief, or both. In addition, we incur certain costs, including legal fees, in defending the status of these parties as independent contractors.\nWhile we believe that our contract carriers and owner-operators and their drivers are properly classified as independent contractors rather than as employees, adverse decisions have been rendered recently in certain cases pending against us, including with respect to determinations that certain of our contract carriers and owner-operators are improperly classified. Such adverse final outcomes in these matters could, among other things, entitle certain of our contract carriers and owner-operators and their drivers to reimbursement with respect to certain expenses and to the benefit of wage-and-hour laws and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for us, and could result in changes to the independent contractor status of our contract carriers and owner-operators. Changes to state laws governing the definition of independent contractors could also impact the status of our contract carriers and owner-operators. Adverse final outcomes in these matters or changes to state laws could cause us to change our business model, which could have a material adverse effect on our business strategies, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These claims involve potentially significant classes that could involve thousands of claimants and, accordingly, significant potential damages and litigation costs, and could lead others to bring similar claims.\nThe results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur overseas operations are subject to various operational and financial risks that could adversely affect our business.\nThe services we provide outside the U.S. are subject to risks resulting from changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements, tax policies, difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents, different liability standards, issues related to compliance with anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, data protection, trade compliance, and intellectual property laws of countries that do not protect our rights relating to our intellectual property, including our proprietary information systems, to the same extent as do U.S. laws. The occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region. In addition, as we expand our business in foreign countries, we will be exposed to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls.\nOur European business heavily relies on subcontracting and we use a large number of temporary employees in these operations. Any failure to properly manage our subcontractors or temporary employees in Europe could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, earnings, financial position and outlook.\nSubcontracting plays a key role in our European business, which we operate through our majority-owned subsidiary, XPO Logistics Europe SA. As of December 31, 2019, we subcontracted approximately 53% of our Transportation segment operations in the region. As a result, we are exposed to various risks related to managing our subcontractors, such as the risk that they do not fulfill their assignments in a satisfactory manner or within the specified deadlines. Such failures could compromise our ability to fulfill our commitments to our customers, comply with applicable regulations or otherwise meet our customers\u2019 expectations. In some situations, the poor execution of services by our subcontractors could result in a customer terminating a contract. Such failures by our subcontractors could harm our reputation and ability to win new business and could lead to our being liable for contractual\ndamages. Furthermore, in the event of a failure by our subcontractors to fulfill their assignments in a satisfactory manner, we could be required to perform unplanned work or additional services in line with the contracted service, without receiving any additional compensation. Lastly, some of our subcontractors in Europe may not be insured or may not have sufficient resources available to handle any claims from customers resulting from potential damage and losses relating to their performance of services on our behalf. As a result, any non-compliance by our subcontractors with their contractual or legal obligations may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nXPO Logistics Europe also makes significant use of temporary staff. We cannot guarantee that temporary employees are as well-trained as our other employees. Specifically, we may be exposed to the risk that temporary employees may not perform their assignments in a satisfactory manner or may not comply with our safety rules in an appropriate manner, whether as a result of their lack of experience or otherwise. If such risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe are involved in multiple lawsuits and are subject to various claims that could result in significant expenditures and impact our operations.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various types of claims and litigation. In addition to the matters described in the risk factor \u201cCertain of our businesses rely on owner-operators and contract carriers to conduct their operations, and the status of these parties as independent contractors, rather than employees, is being challenged,\u201d we are subject to claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, vehicular accidents, cargo and other property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters, including with respect to claims asserted under various other theories of agency or employer liability. Claims against us may exceed the amount of insurance coverage that we have or may not be covered by insurance at all. Businesses that we acquire also increase our exposure to litigation. Material increases in the frequency or severity of vehicular accidents, liability claims or workers\u2019 compensation claims, or the unfavorable resolution of claims, or our failure to recover, in full or in part, under indemnity provisions with transportation providers, could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Our involvement in the transportation of certain goods, including but not limited to hazardous materials, could also increase our exposure in the event that we or one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injury or contamination. In addition, significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability.\nAn increase in the number or severity of self-insured claims or an increase in insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe use a combination of self-insurance programs and large-deductible purchased insurance to provide for the costs of employee medical, vehicular collision and accident, cargo and workers\u2019 compensation claims. Our estimated liability for self-retained insurance claims reflects certain actuarial assumptions and judgments, which are subject to a degree of variability. We reserve for anticipated losses and expenses and periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult. This inherent difficulty, along with legal expenses, incurred but not reported claims, and other uncertainties can cause unfavorable differences between actual self-insurance costs and our reserve estimates. Accordingly, our ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. We periodically evaluate our level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on targeted risk tolerance and premium expense. An increase in the number or severity of self-insured claims or an increase in insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on us, while higher self-insured retention levels may increase the impact of loss occurrences on our results of operations.\nIn addition, the cost of providing benefits under our medical plans is dependent on a variety of factors, including governmental laws and regulations, healthcare cost trends, claims experience and healthcare decisions by plan participants. As a result, we are unable to predict how the cost of providing benefits under medical plans will affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are currently subject to securities class action litigation and may be subject to similar litigation in the future. Such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are currently subject to securities class action litigation alleging violations of securities laws, which could harm our business and require us to incur significant costs. In December 2018, two purported class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our officers; these lawsuits alleged that we made false and misleading statements, purported to assert claims for violations of federal securities laws and sought unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. One class action lawsuit has since been voluntarily dismissed. While we believe that we have a number of valid defenses to the claims described above and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the remaining class action lawsuit, the matter is in the early stages of litigation and no assessment can be made as to the likely outcome of the matter or whether it will be material to us. Also, we may be subject to additional proceedings of this type in the future, which could require significant attention from management or result in significant legal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards, any of which could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks associated with defined benefit plans for our current and former employees, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial position.\nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans and a postretirement medical plan. Our defined benefit pension plans include funded and unfunded plans in the U.S. and the U.K. A decline in interest rates or lower returns on funded plan assets may cause increases in the expense and funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans and for our postretirement medical plan. Despite past amendments that froze our defined benefit pension plans to new participants and curtailed benefits, these pension plans remain subject to volatility associated with interest rates, inflation, returns on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions and statutory funding requirements. In addition to being subject to volatility associated with interest rates, our postretirement medical plan remains subject to volatility associated with actuarial assumptions and trends in healthcare costs. Any of the aforementioned factors could lead to a significant increase in the expense of these plans and a deterioration in the solvency of these plans, which could significantly increase our contribution requirements. As a result, we are unable to predict the effect on our financial statements associated with our defined benefit pension plans and our postretirement medical plan.\nWe may be adversely affected by interest rate changes because of our floating rate credit facilities.\nThe Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, as amended (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d), the senior secured term loan credit agreement, as amended (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d), provide for an interest rate based on London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) or a Base Rate, as defined in the agreements, plus an applicable margin. Our European trade receivables securitization program (the \u201cReceivables Securitization Program\u201d) provides for an interest rate at lenders\u2019 cost of funds plus an applicable margin. Our financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates since the ABL Facility, Term Loan Facility and Receivables Securitization Program are subject to floating interest rates. Refer to Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d for the impact on interest expense of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the interest rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Additionally, the interest rates on some of our debt is tied to LIBOR. In July 2017, the head of the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR, as well as the transition from LIBOR to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on our outstanding debt that currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark rate, and ultimately, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because a significant proportion of our assets, liabilities and earnings are denominated in foreign currencies.\nWe present our financial statements in U.S. dollars, but we have a significant proportion of our net assets and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the euro and British pound sterling. Consequently, a depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have an adverse impact on our financial results as further discussed in Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\u201d\nThe economic uncertainties relating to eurozone monetary policies may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate against other currencies. Currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. For example, in the event that one or more European countries were to replace the euro with another currency, our sales into such countries, or in Europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established. Accordingly, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our business and financial condition in Europe and the business of the combined company.\nThe decision of the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our operations.\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. voted in favor of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU (\u201cBrexit\u201d) in a national referendum. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the EU and entered into a transition period to, among other things, negotiate an agreement with the EU governing the future relationship between the EU and the U.K. The referendum and subsequent withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU and will have uncertain impacts on our transportation and logistics operations in Europe. In 2019, we derived approximately 12% of our revenue from the U.K. and an aggregate 26% from the rest of the European countries where we operate. In addition, the implementation of Brexit has caused, and may continue to cause, uncertainty in the global markets.\nThe effects of Brexit on our transportation and logistics operations in Europe will depend on any agreements the U.K. ultimately reaches to retain access to EU markets either during the transitional period or more permanently. The laws and regulations that will apply to the U.K. domestic economy will depend, in large part, on the content of any agreements the U.K. is able to negotiate with the EU and current laws and regulations may either be replaced or replicated after withdrawal, including those governing manufacturing, labor, environmental, data protection/privacy, competition and other matters either applicable to the transportation and logistics industry directly or with potential impact on the demand for our services in the U.K. or in Europe more generally.\nIf the U.K. cannot reach an agreement with the EU, it will likely have an adverse impact on access to labor in the U.K. and trade between the U.K. and EU and may create further short-term currency volatility. In the absence of a future trade deal, the U.K.\u2019s trade with the EU and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the World Trade Organization, which could result in uncertain demand for our services in the U.K. and its trading partners. In addition, the movement of goods between the U.K. and the remaining member states of the EU will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure, which may have unexpected impacts on our ability to efficiently provide our transportation and logistics services. Moreover, currency volatility could drive a weaker U.K. pound which could result in a decrease in our reported consolidated financial results for the U.K., which are reported in US dollars.\nAny adverse consequences of Brexit, such as a deterioration in the U.K.\u2019s or the EU\u2019s economic condition, currency exchange rates, bilateral trade agreements or regulatory trade environment, including the potential imposition of tariffs, could reduce demand for our services in the U.K. or the EU, negatively impact the value of our defined benefit pension plans in the U.K., or otherwise have a negative impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nSales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may fund any future acquisitions or our capital requirements from time to time, in whole or part, through sales or issuances of our common stock or equity-based securities, subject to prevailing market conditions and our financing needs. Future equity financing will dilute the interests of our then-existing stockholders, and future sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not own, and may not acquire, all of the outstanding shares of XPO Logistics Europe SA, the majority-owned subsidiary through which we conduct our European operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we owned 95.4% of the outstanding shares of XPO Logistics Europe SA, the majority-owned subsidiary through which we conduct our European operations. We may or may not acquire the remaining shares of XPO Logistics Europe, or we may choose to enact a \u201csqueeze out\u201d merger, which is permitted under\nFrench law when a holder owns more than 95% of outstanding shares. As long as we do not wholly own XPO Logistics Europe, we do not have access to all of its cash flow to service our debt, as we will receive a prorated portion of any dividend based on our ownership percentage. In addition, we will be subject to limitations on our ability to enter into transactions with XPO Logistics Europe that are not on arms-length terms, which could limit synergies that we could otherwise achieve between our North American and European operations. Moreover, XPO Logistics Europe would be forced to continue as a listed public company in France, thereby incurring certain recurring costs.\nVolatility in fuel prices impacts our fuel surcharge revenue and may impact our profitability.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the availability and price of fuel, all of which are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside of our control.\nFuel expense constitutes one of the greatest costs to our LTL and full truckload carrier operations, as well as to the independent contractor drivers and third-party transportation providers who transport freight arranged by our other operations. Accordingly, we may be adversely affected by the timing and degree of fuel price fluctuations. As is customary in our industry, most of our customer contracts include fuel surcharge programs or other cost-recovery mechanisms to mitigate the effect of any fuel price increases over base amounts established in the contract. However, these mechanisms may not fully capture an increase in fuel price, as there is a lag between payment for fuel and collection of the surcharge revenue. Furthermore, market pressures may limit our ability to assess fuel surcharges in the future. The extent to which we are able to recover increases in fuel costs may be impacted by the amount of empty or out-of-route truck miles or engine idling time.\nDecreases in fuel prices reduce the cost of transportation services and accordingly, will reduce our revenues and may reduce margins for certain lines of business. Significant changes in the price or availability of fuel in future periods, or significant changes in our ability to mitigate fuel price increases through the use of fuel surcharges, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, fleet capacity and ability to generate both revenues and profits.\nExtreme or unusual weather conditions whether due to climate change or otherwise, can disrupt our operations, impact freight volumes, and increase our costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results.\nOur business depends, in part, on predictable temperate weather patterns. Certain seasonal weather conditions and isolated weather events can disrupt our operations. We frequently incur costs related to snow and ice removal, towing and other maintenance activities during winter months. At least some of our operations are constantly at risk of extreme adverse weather conditions. Any unusual or prolonged adverse weather patterns in our areas of operations or markets, whether due to climate change or otherwise, can temporarily impact freight volumes and increase our costs.\nIssues related to the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, whether related to our failure to enforce our own rights or infringement claims brought by others, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use both internally developed and purchased technologies in conducting our business. Whether internally developed or purchased, it is possible that users of these technologies could be claimed to infringe upon or violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. In the event that a claim is made against us by a third party for the infringement of intellectual property rights, a settlement or adverse judgment against us could result in increased costs to license the technology or a legal prohibition against our using the technology. Thus, our failure to obtain, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights, to protect our intellectual property and technology. Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated; our trade secrets and other confidential information could be disclosed in an unauthorized manner to third parties; or we may fail to secure the rights to intellectual property developed by our employees, contractors and others. Efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be time-consuming and costly, distract management\u2019s attention and our resources, and ultimately be unsuccessful. Moreover, should we fail\nto develop and properly manage future intellectual property, this could adversely affect our market positions and business opportunities.\nWe are subject to regulation, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies in the U.S. and in foreign countries where we operate. These regulatory agencies have authority and oversight of domestic and international transportation services and related activities, licensure, motor carrier operations, safety and security and other matters. We must comply with various insurance and surety bond requirements to act in the capacities for which we are licensed. Our subsidiaries and independent contractors must also comply with applicable regulations and requirements of various agencies. Through our subsidiaries and operations, we hold various licenses required to carry out our domestic and international services. These licenses permit us to provide services as a motor carrier, property broker, indirect air carrier, OTI, NVOCC, freight forwarder, air freight forwarder, and ocean freight forwarder. In addition, we are subject to regulations and requirements promulgated by the DOT, FMCSA, DHS, CBP, TSA, FMC, IATA, Canada Border Services Agency and various other international, domestic, state and local agencies and port authorities.\nCertain of our businesses engage in the transportation of hazardous materials, the movement, handling and accidental discharge of which are highly regulated. Our failure to maintain the required licenses, or to comply with applicable regulations, could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See the \u201cRegulation\u201d section under Item 1 for more information.\nFuture laws and regulations may be more stringent and may require changes to our operating practices that influence the demand for our services or require us to incur significant additional costs. We are unable to predict the impact that recently enacted and future regulations may have on our business. In particular, it is difficult to predict which, and in what form, FMCSA regulations may be modified or enforced, and what impact these regulations may have on motor carrier operations or on the aggregate number of trucks that provide hauling capacity to XPO. If higher costs are incurred by us as a result of future changes in regulations, or by the independent contractors or third-party transportation providers who pass increased costs on to us, this could adversely affect our results of operations to the extent we are unable to obtain a corresponding increase in price from our customers.\nChanges in income tax regulations for U.S. and multinational companies may increase our tax liability.\nThe U.S. Congress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d), the EU, and other government agencies in jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates do business have maintained a focus on the taxation of multinational companies. The OECD has recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project. These and other tax laws and related regulations changes, to the extent adopted, may increase tax uncertainty, result in higher compliance cost and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flow.\nFailure to comply with trade compliance laws and regulations applicable to our operations may subject us to liability and result in mandatory or voluntary disclosures to government agencies of transactions or dealings involving sanctioned countries, entities or individuals.\nAs a result of our acquisition activities, we acquired companies with business operations outside the U.S., some of which were not previously subject to certain U.S. laws and regulations, including trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In the course of implementing our compliance processes with respect to the operations of these acquired companies, we have identified a number of transactions or dealings involving countries and entities that are subject to U.S. economic sanctions. As disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC, we filed initial voluntary disclosure of such matters with OFAC in August 2016. In August 2018, OFAC addressed these matters by responding with a cautionary letter to us. To our knowledge, OFAC is considering no further action in response to the voluntary disclosure filed by us in August 2016. We may, in the future, identify additional transactions or dealings involving sanctioned countries, entities or individuals. The transactions or dealings that we have identified to date, or other transactions or dealings that we may identify in the future, could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm.\nOur chairman and chief executive officer controls a large portion of our stock and has substantial control over us, which could limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including changes of control.\nUnder applicable SEC rules, our chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Bradley S. Jacobs, beneficially owns approximately 18% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2019. This concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated stockholders. Our preferred stock votes together with our common stock on an \u201cas-converted\u201d basis on all matters, except as otherwise required by law, and separately as a class with respect to certain matters implicating the rights of holders of shares of the preferred stock. Accordingly, Mr. Jacobs can exert substantial influence over our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation, or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders. Additionally, significant fluctuations in the levels of ownership of our largest stockholders, including shares beneficially owned by Mr. Jacobs, could impact the volume of trading, liquidity and market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90175, "SIC": 4731, "TIC": "XPO"}
