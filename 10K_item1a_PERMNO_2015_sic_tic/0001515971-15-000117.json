{"cik": "1096339", "company": "SARATOGA RESOURCES INC /TX", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nOur business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. If any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe nature of our business involves numerous uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses.\nWe engage in exploration and development drilling activities, which are inherently risky. These activities may be unsuccessful for many reasons. In addition to a failure to find oil or natural gas, drilling efforts can be affected by adverse weather conditions (such as hurricanes and tropical storms in the U.S. Gulf Coast region), cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Therefore, the successful drilling of an oil or gas well does not ensure we will realize a profit on our investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, could cause a well to become uneconomic or only marginally economic. In addition to their costs, unsuccessful wells could impede our efforts to replace reserves.\nOur business involves a variety of operating risks, which include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nfires;\n\u2022\nexplosions;\n\u2022\nblow-outs and surface cratering;\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of gas, oil and formation water;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\npipe, cement, subsea well or pipeline failures;\n\u2022\ncasing collapses;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, such as lost or stuck oil field drilling and service tools;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures and discharge of toxic gases.\nIf we experience any of these problems, well bores, platforms, gathering systems and processing facilities could be affected, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations. We could also incur substantial losses due to costs and/or liability incurred as a result of:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\nsevere damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nclean-up responsibilities;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u2022\nrepairs to resume operations.\nOur production, revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a single geographic area, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area.\nUnlike other entities that are geographically diversified, all of our assets and operations are located in , and offshore of, South Louisiana and we do not have the resources to effectively diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. Our lack of diversification may:\n\u2022\nsubject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have an adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nresult in our dependency upon a single or limited number of hydrocarbon basins.\nIn addition, the geographic concentration of our properties in the Gulf Coast region means that some or all of the properties could be affected should the region experience:\n\u2022\nsevere weather, such as hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ndelays or decreases in production, the availability of equipment, facilities or services;\n\u2022\ndelays or decreases in the availability of capacity to transport, gather or process production; and/or\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment.\nFor example, our oil and gas properties were damaged, prior to our acquisition of those properties, by both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and, since our acquisition of the properties, by Hurricanes Gustav, Ike and Isaac. This damage required us, and the prior owners, to spend time and capital on inspections, repairs and debris removal. In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. For additional information, please read \u201c-Our insurance may not protect us against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.\u201d\nBecause all or a number of the properties could experience many of the same conditions at the same time, these conditions could have a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other producers who have properties over a wider geographic area.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile, and a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices would adversely affect our financial results and impede our growth.\nOur financial condition, revenues, profitability and carrying value of our properties depend upon the prevailing prices and demand for oil and natural gas. Commodity prices also affect our cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to access funds through the capital markets. The markets for these commodities are volatile and even relatively modest drops in prices can affect our financial results and impede our growth.\nNatural gas and oil prices historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitical and economic conditions. Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nprice and quantity of foreign imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nactions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil and natural gas price and production controls;\n\u2022\nlevel of consumer product demand, including as a result of competition from alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\nlevel of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in South America and Russia;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;\n\u2022\noverall U.S. and global economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nprice and availability of alternative fuels.\nFurther, oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other. Lower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease our expected future revenues on a per unit basis but also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. This may result in us having to make downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the second half of 2014 and continuing into 2015, commodity prices, particularly oil prices, dropped sharply attributable to a number of factors, including growing supplies attributable to U.S. shale and other development and foreign supplies coming on line in the face of a projected slowing global economy and expected lower demand. As a result, we have seen our average price realized from the sale of oil decline from $97.45 per barrel of crude oil in December 2013 to $58.26 per barrel in December 2014. The sharp decline in prices has resulted in lower sales revenues and operating cash flow and downward adjustments to our estimated reserves and has resulted in the curtailment of numerous planned operations as well as the implementation of severe cost cutting measures. If prices do not recover sufficiently, or quickly enough, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably and to meet our financial obligations.\nOur actual recovery of reserves may differ from our proved reserve estimates.\nThis Form 10-K contains estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves. Estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves is complex and inherently imprecise. It requires interpretation of the available technical data and making many assumptions about future conditions, including price and other economic conditions. In preparing such estimates, projection of production rates, timing of development expenditures and available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data are analyzed. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. This process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. If our interpretations or assumptions used in arriving at our reserve estimates prove to be inaccurate, the amount of oil and gas that will ultimately be recovered may differ materially from the estimated quantities and net present value of reserves owned by us. Any inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could also materially affect the estimated quantities of reserves shown in the reserve reports summarized in this Form 10-K. Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, decommissioning liabilities and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves most likely will vary from estimates. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe may be limited in our ability to maintain or book additional proved undeveloped reserves under the SEC\u2019s rules.\nWe have included in this Form 10-K certain estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2014 prepared in a manner consistent with our and our independent petroleum consultant\u2019s interpretation of the SEC rules relating to modernizing reserve estimation and disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas companies. Included within these SEC reserve rules is a general requirement that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be classified as such if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. This rule may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Further, if we postpone drilling of proved undeveloped reserves beyond this five-year development horizon, we may have to write off reserves previously recognized as proved undeveloped. During 2014 and 2013, we reclassified 7,755 MBoe and 2,439 MBoe, respectively, of reserves previously classified as proved undeveloped reserves as a result of the failure to develop those reserves within five years of their being recorded as proved undeveloped. We may incur similar reclassifications and charges in the future if we are unable to develop some or all of our proved undeveloped reserves within five years of booking.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 63% of our total proved reserves were undeveloped and approximately 18% of our total proved reserves were developed non-producing. There can be no assurance that all of those reserves will ultimately be developed or produced.\nWhile we have plans or are in the process of developing plans for exploiting and producing a majority of our proved reserves, there can be no assurance that we will have the resources to fully develop those reserves or that all of those reserves will ultimately be developed or produced. While we presently act as operator on substantially all of our properties, to the extent that we are not the operator with respect to our proved undeveloped reserves, we may not be in a position to control the timing of all development activities. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that all of our undeveloped and developed non-producing reserves will ultimately be produced during the time periods we have planned, at the costs we have budgeted, or at all, which could result in the write-off of previously recognized reserves.\nUnless we replace crude oil and natural gas reserves, our future reserves and production will decline.\nIn general, production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Our total proved reserves decline as reserves are produced unless we conduct other successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of crude oil and natural gas reserves would be impaired to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. As a result of declining cash flow from operations during 2013 and 2014, we have limited ability to fund exploration and development activities in the absence of outside funding. At December 31, 2014, we lacked a revolving credit facility and had limited funds on hand to support our drilling and development budget. In the absence of additional external financing, our ability to make planned capital investments to maintain and expand our reserves is limited and would be further impaired to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced due to natural declines in production, declines in commodity prices or otherwise. Even if we have sufficient financing to support our optimum development plan, we may not be successful in exploring for, developing or acquiring additional reserves.\nThe nature and age of our wells may result in fluctuations in our production resulting from mechanical failures and other factors.\nThe majority of our wells have been in operation and have produced for many years. As a result of the age of those wells and their location in bay environments, those wells typically experience higher maintenance requirements than newer wells and wells located onshore. As a result, some of our wells may periodically be shut-in to perform maintenance or to restore optimal production levels or as a result of maintenance by third parties that operate facilities that serve our wells. Due to the periodic need to shut-in wells, we experience routine fluctuations in production levels with production declining below normal operating capacity during periods of maintenance. During 2014, deferred maintenance and needed facilities modernizations associated with aging facilities contributed to a marked decline in production early in the year and required substantial investments and devotion of resources to address the same over the course of the year. Further, because of their location in a bay environment, we sometimes experience delays in identifying and addressing production declines.\nOur offshore operations involve special risks that could affect our operations adversely.\nOffshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or leasehold acquisitions, or result in loss of equipment and properties. In particular, we are not intending to put in place business interruption insurance due to its high cost. We therefore may not be able to rely on insurance coverage in the event of such natural phenomena.\nOur participation in, and realization of value from, shallow water ultra-deep shelf wells is subject to certain financing and operating risks that may prevent us from realizing the value of our deep reserve potential and expose us to delays, unexpected costs and other adverse financial consequences.\nWe have identified potential ultra-deep prospects underlying our transition zone acreage. The cost of exploration of such prospects, even when limited to our proportionate interest in such costs, is likely beyond that which we could fund from our current financial resources. Accordingly, we intend to seek partners to absorb a substantial portion of our share of such exploration costs. To that end, we have conducted discussions with various parties with respect to the potential formation of a joint venture to explore one or more ultra-deep prospects. We have not, as of December 31, 2014, entered into a definitive agreement with any prospective partner to fund or participate in the exploration of our ultra-deep prospects and, in light of the weak commodity price environment at December 31, 2014, we do not anticipate finalizing any such arrangements until a recovery in commodity prices has occurred. In the event that we enter into such a joint venture arrangement but are unable to make satisfactory arrangements to fund our portion of exploration costs, our interests in some of our ultra-deep prospects may be substantially reduced or lost with little or no benefit from such interests accruing to our benefit. Further, the shallow water ultra-deep wells are subject to very high pressures and temperatures. The drilling, logging and completion techniques associated with such wells may near the limits of existing technologies. As a result, new technologies and techniques are being developed to deal with these challenges. The use of advanced drilling technologies involves a higher risk of technological failure and potentially higher costs. In addition, there can be delays in completion due to necessary equipment that is specially ordered to handle the challenges of ultra-deep wells. Even if we are able to participate in drilling ultra-deep wells there is no assurance that such wells will be commercially viable. Such wells are presently expected to be natural gas wells and, based on the current low price of natural gas, there is no assurance that the wells can be operated in an economically feasible manner even if successfully completed.\nOur participation in, and realization of value from, Gulf of Mexico shelf prospects is subject to participation of partners in the financing and development of those prospects and subjects us to risk associated with operating under rules of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (\u201cBOEM\u201d).\nDuring 2013, we acquired four leases totaling 19,814 acres in the shallow Gulf of Mexico outer continental shelf (\u201cOCS\u201d). The leases are located in the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and are subject to rules and regulations of the BOEM. We have no history of developing and operating properties subject to BOEM regulation or in the deeper waters that characterize those leases and lack the financial resources to develop those prospects. Accordingly, we intend to seek partners in the development of such prospects which may entail farm-outs, promoted deals or other similar arrangements with partners having greater experience and financial resources to carry out such development and operating activities. If we are unable to secure partners to participate in such activities we may realize no value from the prospects and may lose our investment in those prospects. Even if we are able to secure necessary partners to fund, develop and operate those prospects, there is no guaranty that such activities will result in commercially viable wells.\nTo cover the various obligations of lessees on the OCS, such as the cost to plug and abandon wells and decommission and remove platforms and pipelines at the end of production, the BOEM generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met. As a result of the recent bankruptcy of ATP Oil and Gas, the BOEM has indicated that it may review the estimated cost of future plugging, abandonment, decommissioning and removal obligations of other OCS operators and may increase the amount of financial assurance required with respect to these obligations. While we believe that we are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements of the BOEM, the BOEM could increase bonding requirements associated with planned development of our OCS properties. The cost of these bonds or other surety could be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other surety could be obtained in all cases. In addition, we may be required to provide letters of credit to support the issuance of these bonds or other surety. The cost of compliance with these supplemental bonding requirements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur insurance may not protect us against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.\nWe maintain insurance for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. Due to market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance policies are economically unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Consistent with industry practice, we are not fully insured against all risks, including high-cost business interruption insurance and drilling and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Due to a number of catastrophic events in recent years, including Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike and Isaac and the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident, insurance underwriters increased insurance premiums for many of the coverages historically maintained and issued general notices of cancellation and significant changes for a wide variety of insurance coverages. The oil and natural gas industry suffered damage from Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike and Isaac. As a result, insurance costs for many operators in the Gulf Coast region have increased significantly from the costs that similarly situated participants in this industry have historically incurred. Insurers are requiring higher retention levels and limit the amount of insurance proceeds that are available after a major wind storm in the event that damages are incurred. If storm activity in the future is as severe, insurance underwriters may no longer insure assets in the Gulf Coast region against weather-related damage. In addition, we do not intend to put in place business interruption insurance due to its high cost. This insurance may not be economically available in the future, which could adversely impact business prospects in the Gulf Coast region and adversely impact our operations. If an accident or other event resulting in damage to our operations, including severe weather, terrorist acts, war, civil disturbances, pollution or environmental damage, occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or a recoverable indemnity from a vendor, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or be able to obtain insurance against certain risks.\nCompetition for oil and gas properties and prospects is intense and some of our competitors have larger financial, technical and personnel resources that could give them an advantage in evaluating and obtaining properties and prospects.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for reviewing prospects, acquiring properties, marketing oil and gas and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors are major or independent oil and gas companies that possess and employ financial resources that allow them to obtain substantially greater technical and personnel resources than ours. We actively compete with other companies when acquiring new leases or oil and gas properties. For example, new leases may be acquired through a \u201csealed bid\u201d process and are generally awarded to the highest bidder. These additional resources can be particularly important in reviewing prospects and purchasing properties. Competitors may be able to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Competitors may also be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects than we are able or willing to pay. Further, our competitors may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will impact attaining success in the industry. If we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future, our future revenues and growth may be diminished or restricted.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated reserves.\nThis Form 10-K contains estimates of our future net cash flows from our proved reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on average prices for the preceding twelve-month period and costs in effect on the day of the estimate. However, actual future net cash flows from our natural gas and oil properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nthe volume, pricing and duration of our natural gas and oil hedging contracts;\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for natural gas and oil;\n\u2022\nactual prices we receive for natural gas and oil;\n\u2022\nour actual operating costs in producing natural gas and oil;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of our capital expenditures and decommissioning costs;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations and taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute exploration and exploitation plans on a timely basis and within budget, and consequently could adversely affect our anticipated cash flow.\nWe utilize third-party services to maximize the efficiency of our organization. The cost of oil field services may increase or decrease depending on the demand for services by other oil and gas companies. There is no assurance that we will be able to contract for such services on a timely basis or that the cost of such services will remain at a satisfactory or affordable level. Shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or personnel could delay or adversely affect our exploitation and exploration operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMarket conditions or transportation impediments may hinder access to oil and gas markets, delay production or increase our costs.\nMarket conditions, the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation or the remote location of our drilling operations may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay production. The availability of a ready market for oil and gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines or trucking and terminal facilities. In offshore operations, market access depends on the proximity of and our ability to tie into existing production platforms and, where those facilities are owned or operated by third parties, the ability to negotiate commercially satisfactory arrangements with the owners or operators. We may be required to shut in wells or delay initial production for lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of pipeline or gathering system capacity. Restrictions on our ability to sell our oil and natural gas may have several other adverse effects, including higher transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price) or, in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time, possible loss of a lease due to lack of production. In the event that we encounter restrictions in our ability to tie our production to a gathering system, we may face considerable delays from the initial discovery of a reservoir to the actual production of the oil and gas and realization of revenues. In some cases, our wells may be tied back to platforms owned by parties with no economic interests in these wells. There can be no assurance that owners of such platforms will continue to operate the platforms. If the owners cease to operate the platforms or their processing equipment, we may be required to shut in the associated wells, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be the operator on all of our properties and therefore are not in a position to control the timing of development efforts, the associated costs, or the rate of production of the reserves on such properties.\nAs we carry out our planned drilling program, we may not serve as operator of all planned wells. We currently operate over 99% of our proved reserves, but do not expect to operate any wells that may be drilled on ultra-deep prospects or the Gulf of Mexico shelf prospects acquired during 2013. As a result, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of some non-operated properties or their associated costs. Dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects, and limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities. The success and timing of development and exploitation activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel;\n\u2022\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u2022\napproval of other participants in drilling wells;\n\u2022\nselection of technology; and\n\u2022\nthe rate of production of the reserves.\nEach of these factors, and others, could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs.\nWe are exposed to trade credit risk in the ordinary course of our business activities.\nWe are exposed to risks of loss in the event of nonperformance by our vendors, customers and by counterparties to our price risk management arrangements. Some of our vendors, customers and counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. Many of our vendors, customers and counterparties finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. Declines in the credit markets and the availability of credit or declines in equity values of our vendors, customers and counterparties, as well as declines in cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, may result in a significant reduction in our vendors, customers and counterparties liquidity and ability to make payments or perform on their obligations to us. Even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, we may experience financial losses in our dealings with other parties. Any increase in the nonpayment or nonperformance by our vendors, customers and/or counterparties could reduce our cash flows.\nWe sell the majority of our production to a small number of customers.\nTwo customers accounted for approximately 87% of our total oil and natural gas revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014. Our inability to continue to sell our production to those customers, if not offset by sales with new or other existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nUnanticipated decommissioning costs could materially adversely affect our future financial position and results of operations.\nWe may become responsible for unanticipated costs associated with abandoning and reclaiming wells, facilities and pipelines. Abandonment and reclamation of facilities and the costs associated therewith is often referred to as \u201cdecommissioning.\u201d Should decommissioning be required that is not presently anticipated or the decommissioning be accelerated, such as can happen after a hurricane, such costs may exceed the value of reserves remaining at any particular time. We may have to draw on funds from other sources to satisfy such costs. The use of other funds to satisfy such decommissioning costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. During 2012 and 2013, we incurred decommissioning costs in excess of our estimates and established reserve and we may incur costs in excess of our reserves in the future.\nLower oil and gas prices and other factors may result in impairments of our asset carrying values.\nUnder the successful efforts method of accounting, whenever circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired, we are required to compare the expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, an impairment charge is realized to reduce the capitalized cost to fair value. In computing future undiscounted cash flows of assets, we take into account estimates of future crude oil and natural gas prices as well as operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data. Accordingly, a decline in oil and natural gas prices could cause a future write-down of capitalized costs and a non-cash impairment charge against future earnings.\nOur success depends on dedicated and skillful management and staff, whose departure could disrupt our business operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced engineers, geoscientists and other professional staff. We depend to a large extent on the efforts, technical expertise and continued employment of these personnel and members of our management team. If a significant number of them resign or become unable to continue in their present role and if they are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Risk Management Activities\nIf we place hedges on future production and encounter difficulties meeting that production, we may not realize the originally anticipated cash flows.\nOur assets consist of a mix of reserves, with some being developed while others are undeveloped. To the extent that we sell the production of these reserves on a forward-looking basis but do not realize that anticipated level of production, our cash flow may be adversely affected if energy prices rise above the prices for the forward-looking sales. In this case, we would be required to make payments to the purchaser of the forward-looking sale equal to the difference between the current commodity price and that in the sales contract multiplied by the physical volume of the shortfall. There is the risk that production estimates could be inaccurate or that storms or other unanticipated problems could cause the production to be less than the amount anticipated, causing us to make payments to the purchasers pursuant to the terms of the hedging contracts.\nOur price risk management activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income, which may adversely affect our cash flows.\nWe enter into derivative contracts to reduce the impact of natural gas and oil price volatility on our cash flow from operations. Currently, we use a combination of natural gas and crude oil swap and physical arrangements to mitigate the volatility of future natural gas and oil prices received on our production.\nOur actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into derivative contracts for such period. If the actual amount of production is higher than we estimate, we will have greater commodity price exposure than we intended. If the actual amount of production is lower than the notional amount that is subject to our derivative financial instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial decrease in our liquidity. As a result of these factors, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows. In addition, our price risk management activities are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\na counterparty may not perform its obligations under the applicable derivative instrument;\n\u2022\nproduction is less than expected;\n\u2022\nthere may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying commodity price in the derivative instrument and the actual price received; and\n\u2022\nthe steps we take to monitor our derivative financial instruments may not detect and prevent violations of our risk management policies and procedures.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage the commodity price risk of our production if energy prices fall, we may not realize the anticipated cash flows from our assets.\nDuring the third quarter of 2012, we instituted a hedging program in an effort to manage our commodity price risk. If we fail to effectively manage the commodity price risk of our production and energy prices fall, we may not be able to realize the cash flows from our assets that are currently anticipated even if we are successful in increasing the production and ultimate recovery of reserves. Compared to some other participants in the oil and gas industry, we are a relatively small company with modest resources. Moreover, our lack of a revolving credit facility may limit the scope and nature of commodity price risk management tools available to us. There is the possibility that we may be unable to find counterparties willing to enter into derivative arrangements with us or be required to either purchase relatively expensive put options, or commit to deliver future production, to manage the commodity price risk of our future production. To the extent that we commit to deliver future production, we may be forced to make cash deposits available to counterparties as they mark to market these financial hedges. Proposed changes in regulations affecting derivatives may further limit or raise the cost, or increase the credit support required to hedge. This funding requirement may limit the level of commodity price risk management that we are prudently able to complete. In addition, we are unlikely to hedge undeveloped reserves to the same extent that we hedge the anticipated production from proved developed reserves.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisition Strategy\nOur acquisitions may be stretching our existing resources.\nWe acquired our principal properties in 2008 and may make acquisitions in the future. Future transactions may prove to stretch our internal resources and infrastructure. As a result, we may need to invest in additional resources, which will increase our costs. Any further acquisitions we make over the short term would likely intensify these risks.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of the properties we acquire.\nIntegration of the operations of the properties we acquire with our existing business is a complex, time-consuming and costly process. Failure to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and operations in a timely manner may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The difficulties of combining the acquired operations include, among other things:\n\u2022\noperating a larger organization;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities;\n\u2022\nintegrating corporate, technological and administrative functions;\n\u2022\ndiverting management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\ndiverting financial resources away from existing operations;\n\u2022\nan increase in our indebtedness; and\n\u2022\npotential environmental or regulatory liabilities and title problems.\nThe process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nIn addition, we face the risk of identifying, competing for and pursuing other acquisitions, which takes time and expense and diverts management\u2019s attention from other activities.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from our future acquisitions, such as increased earnings, cost savings and revenue enhancements, for various reasons, including difficulties integrating operations and personnel, higher than expected acquisition and operating costs or other difficulties, unknown liabilities, inaccurate reserve estimates and fluctuations in market prices.\nThe properties we acquire may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the acquired properties or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities.\nOur business strategy includes acquisitions, which may include acquisitions of exploration and production companies, producing properties and undeveloped leasehold interests. The successful acquisition of oil and natural gas properties requires assessments of many factors that are inherently inexact and may be inaccurate, including the following:\n\u2022\nacceptable prices for available properties;\n\u2022\namounts of recoverable reserves;\n\u2022\nestimates of future oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nestimates of future exploratory, development and operating costs;\n\u2022\nestimates of the costs and timing of plugging and abandonment; and\n\u2022\nestimates of potential environmental and other liabilities.\nOur assessment of acquired properties will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become familiar enough with the properties to fully assess their capabilities and deficiencies. In the course of our due diligence, we may not physically inspect every well, platform or pipeline. Even if we physically inspect each of these, our inspections may not reveal structural and environmental problems, such as pipeline corrosion or groundwater contamination. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities associated with such risks. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations. If an acquired property does not perform as originally estimated, we may have an impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on or financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Access to Capital and Financing\nOur level of indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds or capitalize on acquisition or other business opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had total indebtedness of $179.8 million. Our leverage and the current and future restrictions contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness may reduce our ability to incur additional indebtedness, engage in certain transactions or capitalize on acquisition or other business opportunities. Our indebtedness and other financial obligations and restrictions could have financial consequences. For example, they could:\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, general business activities or other purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nresult in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates to the extent that our debt is at a variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nhave a material adverse effect if we fail to comply with financial and restrictive covenants in any of our debt agreements, including an event of default if such event is not cured or waived;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of future cash flow to payments of our indebtedness and other financial obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to those who have proportionately less debt.\nIf we are unable to meet future debt service obligations and other financial obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness and other financial transactions, seek additional equity or sell assets. We may then be unable to obtain such financing or capital or sell assets on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and development and exploration efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our future operating performance and financial results will be subject, in part, to factors beyond our control, including interest rates and general economic, financial and business conditions. We cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings or other facilities will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt, we may be required to:\n\u2022\nrefinance all or a portion of our debt;\n\u2022\nobtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nsell some of our assets or operations;\n\u2022\nreduce or delay capital expenditures, research and development efforts and acquisitions; or\n\u2022\nrevise or delay our strategic plans.\nIf we are required to take any of these actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of the our various debt instruments.\nThe covenants in the indenture governing our senior notes impose restrictions that may limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to take certain actions. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness.\nThe indentures governing our senior notes contain various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur dividend or other payment obligations;\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness and issue preferred stock; or\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries.\nIf we breach any of these covenants, a default could occur. A default, if not waived, would entitle certain of our debt holders to declare all amounts borrowed under the breached indenture to become immediately due and payable, which could also cause the acceleration of obligations under certain other agreements and the termination of our credit facility. In the event of acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness, we cannot assure that we would be able to repay our debt or obtain new financing to refinance our debt. Even if new financing was made available to us, it may not be on terms acceptable to us.\nIn early 2015, we entered into short term forbearance agreements with the principal holders of our outstanding indebtedness. Pursuant to the forbearance agreements, we paid interest accrued and owing as of December 31, 2014 on our most senior debt but did not pay interest accrued and owing as of January 1, 2015 on other debt. Additionally, we agreed to provide information to our debt holders, to retain financial advisors acceptable to our debt holders and undertook additional obligations with a view to recapitalizing or restructuring our company. The forbearance agreements were entered into in light of the steep drop in commodity prices that resulted in reduced revenues and operating cash flows. If we are unable to substantially improve operating cash flows, secure additional funding or reach a longer term accommodation from our debt holders, we may be required to sell assets or take other measures to address upcoming payment obligations, which measures may include seeking protection in bankruptcy.\nWe expect to have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms.\nWe expect to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, development, production, exploration and abandonment of oil and gas properties. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors and we cannot predict accurately the timing and amount of our capital requirements. We have historically financed our capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and cash on hand, including cash received through multiple equity and debt offerings undertaken during 2011, 2012 and 2013. However, if our capital requirements vary materially from those provided for in our current projections, we may require additional financing to support future capital expenditures. At December 31, 2014, we lacked a revolving credit facility, had inadequate resources on hand to fully fund our planned development operations and had no existing commitments to provide financing to support future capital requirements. A decrease in expected revenues or an adverse change in market conditions could make obtaining this financing economically unattractive or impossible.\nThe cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets may increase substantially while the availability of funds from those markets may diminish significantly. Also, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets may increase as lenders and institutional investors could increase interest rates, impose tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity at all or on terms similar to our current debt and, in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers.\nAn increase in our indebtedness, as well as the credit market and debt and equity capital market conditions discussed above could negatively impact our ability to secure, and remain in compliance with the financial covenants under, any revolving credit facility which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to finance our growth as expected, we could be required to seek alternative financing, the terms of which may be less favorable to us, or not pursue growth opportunities.\nWithout additional capital resources, we may be forced to limit or defer our planned natural gas and oil exploration and development program and this will adversely affect the recoverability and ultimate value of our natural gas and oil properties, in turn negatively affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be unable to obtain sufficient credit capacity with counterparties to finance the hedging of our future crude oil and natural gas production which may limit our ability to manage price risk. As a result, we may lack the capital necessary to complete potential acquisitions, obtain credit necessary to enter into derivative contracts to hedge our future crude oil and natural gas production or to capitalize on other business opportunities.\nAny future financial crisis may impact our business and financial condition. We may not be able to obtain funding in the capital markets on terms we find acceptable because of the decline in commodity prices.\nThe recent turmoil in energy markets reflected in a steep drop in oil prices has had an impact on our business and our financial condition, and we may face challenges if market conditions do not improve or deteriorate in the future. Historically, we have used our cash flow from operations and funds provided by debt and equity offerings to fund our capital expenditures. The drop in commodity prices has decreased cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures and debt service.\nThe drop in energy prices has also made it more difficult to obtain funding in the public and private capital markets. In particular, the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets generally diminished significantly.\nRisks Related to Environmental and Other Regulations\nOur operations are subject to environmental and other government laws and regulations that are costly and could potentially subject us to substantial liabilities.\nOur oil and gas exploration, production, and related operations are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state, and local agencies. Failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws.\nAll of the jurisdictions in which we operate generally require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and gas. Such jurisdictions also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. The statutes and regulations of certain jurisdictions also limit the rate at which oil and gas can be produced from our properties.\nOur sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not presently regulated and are made at market prices. The price we receive from the sale of those products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. FERC regulations establish an indexing system for transportation rates for oil pipelines, which, generally, index such rate to inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. We are not able to predict with any certainty what effect, if any, these regulations will have on us, but, other factors being equal, the regulations may, over time, tend to increase transportation costs which may have the effect of reducing wellhead prices for oil and natural gas liquids.\nFERC has civil penalty authority to impose penalties for current violations. While our operations have not been regulated by FERC, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional entities to FERC annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC from time to time. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.\nOur oil and gas operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations:\n\u2022\nrequire the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences;\n\u2022\nrestrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities;\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and\n\u2022\nimpose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in:\n\u2022\nthe imposition of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nincurring investigatory or remedial obligations; and\n\u2022\nthe imposition of injunctive relief, which could limit or restrict our operations.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general and on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Although we intend to be in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, we cannot assure shareholders that we will be able to comply with existing or new regulations. In addition, the risk of accidental spills, leakages or other circumstances could expose us to extensive liability.\nUnder certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination, or if current or prior operations were conducted consistent with accepted standards of practice. Such liabilities can be significant, and if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are unable to predict the effect of additional environmental laws and regulations that may be adopted in the future, including whether any such laws or regulations would materially adversely increase our cost of doing business or affect operations in any area.\nOur sales of oil and natural gas, and any hedging activities related to such energy commodities, expose us to potential regulatory risks.\nFERC holds statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets relevant to our business. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. With regard to our physical sales of oil and natural gas, and any hedging activities related to these energy commodities, we are required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies, which hold enforcement authority. Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce.\nIn December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). Among the EPA\u2019s rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the CAA, one requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and another regulates emissions of greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, including petroleum refineries and certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities.\nIn addition, the United States Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and a number of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produced. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe adoption of financial reform legislation by Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), signed into law in 2010, requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d), the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations relating to, among other things, the over-the-counter derivatives market. In its rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has issued final regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions would be exempt from these position limits. The financial reform legislation may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our derivative activities, although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time. The financial reform legislation may also require certain counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty. The final rules will be phased in over time according to a specified schedule which is dependent on the finalization of certain other rules to be promulgated jointly by the CFTC and the SEC. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the legislation was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to acquire or renew permits and approvals required for operations, we may be forced to suspend or cease operations altogether.\nThe construction and operation of energy projects require numerous permits and approvals from governmental agencies. We may not be able to obtain all necessary permits and approvals, and as a result our operations may be adversely affected. In addition, obtaining all necessary permits and approvals may necessitate cash expenditures and may create a risk of expensive delays or loss of value if a project is unable to proceed as planned due to changing requirements or local opposition.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nPresident Obama and members of Congress have, on multiple occasions, advocated and proposed legislation that, if enacted, would eliminate certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include (1) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (2) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (3) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (4) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Several bills have been introduced in Congress that would implement these proposals. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur By-laws contain provisions that discourage corporate takeovers and could prevent shareholders from realizing a premium on their investment.\nOur by-laws contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in our management or a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable. For example, they may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. For example, provisions in our by-laws that could delay or prevent a change in management or change in control include:\n\u2022\nthe board is permitted to issue preferred shares and to fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders;\n\u2022\nshareholders have limited ability to remove directors; and\n\u2022\nin order to nominate directors, shareholders must provide advance notice and furnish certain information with respect to the nominee and any other information as may be reasonably required by the Company.\nThese provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to stockholders for their common shares.", "PERMNO": 12903, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "SARA"}
