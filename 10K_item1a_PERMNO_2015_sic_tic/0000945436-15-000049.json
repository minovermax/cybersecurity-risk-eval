This recent turmoil demonstrates how uncertain future economic conditions are and those conditions could negatively impact our ability to obtain debt or equity project financing required for the construction and sale of solar power plants. Additionally, access to capital markets continues to be challenging, especially in Europe. If the slow improvement in market and economic conditions does not continue or turmoil and volatility significantly increase, we may be further limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity and operational and capital expenditure requirements. We may not have sufficient resources to support our business plan, and there can be no assurance that liquidity will be adequate over time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, find other sources of capital or access capital markets, and if adequate funds and alternative resources are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, develop and construct solar power plants, maintain our research and development efforts, provide collateral for our projects or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly impaired. Our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe make significant investments in building our solar energy projects, and the delayed sale of our projects or the inability to sell our projects would adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations.\nThe development and construction of solar power plants can require long periods of time and substantial initial capital investments, and there are significant risks related to the development of solar power plants, including high initial capital expenditure costs to develop and construct functional power plant facilities and the related need for construction capital, the availability of favorable government tax and other incentives, the high cost and potential regulatory and technical difficulties in integrating into new markets, an often limited or unstable marketplace, competition from other sources of electric power, regulatory difficulties including obtaining necessary permits, difficulties in negotiating power purchase agreements with potential customers, educating the market regarding the reliability and benefits of solar energy products and services, costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance and competing with larger, more established solar energy companies and utilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to overcome these risks as we develop our solar power projects and energy services business. There can also be no assurance that a potential project sale can be completed on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our potential inability to obtain regulatory clearance, project financing or enter into sales contracts with customers could adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations. Our liquidity could also be adversely impacted if project sales are delayed.\nWe anticipate that the Solar Energy business will continue to require significant amounts of working capital and other capital. In addition, we plan to make continued investment in the Solar Energy business to expand this business in the near future. Historically, the Solar Energy business has generated U.S. GAAP operating losses as we have ramped up its operations. There can be no assurance that the Solar Energy business will produce sufficient margins in the future to support the capital required for its operations.\nIf we are unable to enter into new financing agreements when needed, or upon desirable terms, for the construction and installation of our solar energy systems, or if any of our current financing partners discontinue or materially change the financing terms for our systems, we may be unable to finance our projects or our borrowing costs could increase, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe typically rely on working capital and credit facilities to fund the up-front costs associated with the design, construction and installation of our solar energy systems and the purchase of components, such as solar modules and inverters, for our systems. In addition, we secure long-term financing upon completion of our solar energy systems for those systems we retain and use the proceeds to refinance the debt incurred for the design, construction and installation of the solar energy systems, as well as to generate profits and cash flow for our business. Without access to sufficient and appropriate financing, or if that financing is not available at desirable rates or on terms we deem appropriate, we would be unable to grow our Solar Energy business by increasing the number of solar energy systems we are simultaneously developing. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future depends on banks' and other financing sources' continued confidence in our business model and the renewable energy industry as a whole. Solar energy has yet to reach widespread market penetration and is dependent on continued support in the form of performance-based incentives, rebates, tax credits, feed-in tariffs and other incentives from federal, state and foreign governments. If this support were to dissipate, our ability to obtain external financing on acceptable terms, or at all, could be materially adversely affected. While we have solar project financing available to us through existing relationships and facilities, our current cash and financing sources may be inadequate to support the anticipated growth in our business plans. In addition, we do not currently have any dedicated financing in some of our emerging and international markets, and obtaining financing in these new markets will present challenges. Our failure to obtain necessary financing to fund our operations would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo date, we have obtained financing for our Solar Energy business from a limited number of financial institutions. If any of these financial institutions decided not to continue financing our solar energy systems or materially changed the terms under which they are willing to provide financing, we could be required to identify new financial institutions and negotiate new financing documentation. The process of identifying new financing partners and agreeing on all relevant business and legal terms could be lengthy and could require us to reduce the rate of the growth of our business until such new financing arrangements were in place. In addition, there can be no assurance that the terms of the financing provided by a new financial institution would compare favorably with the terms available from our current financing partners. Our inability to secure financing could lead to canceled projects, or reduced deal flow, or we could be forced to finance the construction and installation of solar energy systems ourselves. In any such case, our borrowing costs could increase, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain favorable financing from our vendors and suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have historically utilized financing from our vendors and suppliers through customary trade payables or account payables. At times, we have also increased the number of days' payables outstanding. There can be no assurance that our vendors and suppliers will continue to allow us to maintain existing or planned payables balances, and if we were forced to reduce our payables balances below our planned levels, without obtaining alternative financing, our inability to fund our operations would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur solar wafer business experienced a substantial and sustained decline in prices which has had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAccording to independent sources, industry-wide solar wafer pricing fell approximately 40% during the second quarter of 2011. During the third and fourth quarters of 2011, solar wafer pricing continued to decline due to the market downturn. In 2012, solar wafer pricing fell approximately 35% due to excess capacity in the industry. In 2013, solar wafer pricing has been relatively flat compared to the 2012 price. For 2014, mono wafer pricing was essentially unchanged from 2013 whereas multi wafer pricing experienced an increase in the first and second quarters of 2014 as compared to 2013 but then decreased in the third and fourth quarters to levels consistent with 2013. Solar wafer pricing has also been affected by the unfair trade complaints as discussed in depth in the risk factor below. These price decreases had a significant unfavorable impact on our revenue and gross margins during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, and, though we have largely eliminated external solar wafer sales in comparison to historical periods, solar wafer pricing may unfavorably impact future operating results in our Solar Energy business. When selling prices decline, our net sales and gross profit also decline unless we are able to sell more products or reduce the cost to manufacture our products. If the selling prices for our products continue to decline, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Failure to successfully address the challenges facing this business may hinder or prevent our ability to achieve our business objectives in a timely manner, and\nmay also result in less than full recovery of our remaining Solar Energy long-lived assets, which could require further significant asset write-downs.\nHistorically we have made significant investments in our solar energy project pipeline, including both organically developing and acquiring projects from third-parties, and if a number of projects in our pipeline fail to proceed to construction or are not completed, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe solar project development process is long and includes many steps involving site selection and development, commercial contracting and regulatory approval, among other factors. As of December 31, 2014, we had 5.1GW in pipeline, of which 467 MW was under construction at that time. There can be no assurance that pipeline will be converted into completed projects or generate revenues or that we can obtain the necessary financing to construct these projects. As we develop pipeline organically or through acquisitions, some of the projects in our pipeline may not be completed or proceed to construction as a result of various factors. These factors may include changes in applicable laws and regulations, including government incentives, environmental concerns regarding a project or changes in the economics or ability to finance a particular project. If a number of projects are not completed, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur Solar Energy business depends on the solar industry, which is driven largely by the availability and size of government and economic incentives which could be reduced or eliminated, which could have significant negative effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSolar industry demand continues to be mainly driven by the availability and size of government and economic incentives related to the use of solar power because, currently, the cost of solar power exceeds the cost of power furnished by the electric utility grid in most locations. As a result, government bodies in many countries have historically provided incentives in the form of feed-in-tariffs to solar project developers to promote the use of solar energy in on-grid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy. In addition, we rely upon income tax credits and other state incentives in the United States for solar energy systems. Most countries have continued to regularly reduce the rates paid to solar power system owners for generating electricity under their respective feed-in-tariff programs, and these scheduled reductions in feed-in tariff rates are expected to continue. Moreover, the value and pricing of PBIs and RECs, as well as the state PUC approved PPA rates for utilities (which are frequently higher than electricity rates for electricity generated from other energy sources), are likely to continue to decrease, further reducing the U.S. revenue stream from solar projects. These government economic incentives could be further reduced or eliminated altogether, especially in light of ongoing worldwide economic troubles and slow recovery. In addition, some of these solar program incentives expire, decline over time, are limited in total funding or require renewal of authority. Finally, some countries could and certain countries have altered their programs retroactively which would impact our systems currently in place. Reductions in, or eliminations or expirations of, governmental incentives could result in decreased demand for our wafers, our customers\u2019 products and our solar energy systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Semiconductor Materials business depends on the semiconductor device industry, and when that industry experiences a downturn, our sales could decrease, and we could be forced to further reduce our prices while maintaining fixed costs, all of which could have significant negative effects on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur Semiconductor Materials business depends in large part upon the market demand for our customers\u2019 semiconductor devices that are utilized in electronics applications. The semiconductor device industry experiences:\n\u2022\nrapid technological change;\n\u2022\nproduct obsolescence;\n\u2022\nchanges in product mix;\n\u2022\nprice erosion; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in product supply and demand, some of which fluctuations can be severe.\nFrom time to time, the semiconductor device industry has experienced significant downturns. These downturns often occur in connection with declines in general economic conditions. In the second half of 2011, demand for wafers for semiconductor applications started to slow down and dropped by approximately 15% in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the third quarter according to SEMI (the industry association serving the manufacturing supply chains for the microelectronic and photovoltaic industries), and although demand increased during the first quarter of 2012, it dropped again during the second half of 2012. In 2013 and 2014, our unit volumes increased primarily driven by increased demand of larger diameter wafers, however revenues were pressured due to industry overcapacity and other competitive factors. If\nthe semiconductor device industry experiences future downturns, or if the current downturn lingers, we will face pressure to further reduce prices, and we may need to further rationalize capacity and reduce fixed costs. If we are unable to reduce our expenses sufficiently to offset reductions in price and volume, our operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nThe timing of completion of projects in our Solar Energy business fluctuates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations or the market price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly results of operations fluctuate significantly based on the timing of Solar Energy projects, with a significant portion of revenues and megawatts completed recognized during the fourth quarter of each year. There are various reasons for these fluctuations, mostly related to economic incentives and weather patterns. For example, in Canada and in European countries with feed-in tariffs, the construction of solar power systems may be concentrated during the second half of the calendar year, largely due to periodic reductions of the applicable minimum feed-in tariff and the fact that the coldest winter months are January through March, which impacts the amount of construction that occurs. In the United States, customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for other budgetary reasons. If we fail to adequately manage the fluctuations in the timing of our Solar Energy projects, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected.\nExisting regulations and policies governing the electric utility industry, as well as changes to these regulations and policies, may adversely affect demand for our Solar Energy products and services and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for electricity generation is heavily influenced by federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies promulgated by public utility commissions and electric utilities. These regulations and policies govern, among other matters, electricity pricing and the technical interconnection of distributed electricity generation to the grid. The regulations and policies also regulate net metering, which relates to the ability to offset utility-generated electricity consumption by feeding electricity produced by renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, back into the grid. Utility customer purchases of alternative energy, including solar energy, could be deterred by these regulations and policies, which could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our solar energy systems and solar wafers. Changes in consumer electricity tariffs or peak hour pricing policies of utilities, including the introduction of fixed price policies, could also reduce or eliminate the cost savings derived from solar energy systems and, as a result, reduce our customer demand for our systems.\nCertain power purchase agreements signed in connection with our utility-scale business are subject to public utility commission approval, and such approval may not be obtained or may be delayed.\nAs a solar energy provider in the U.S., the power purchase agreements executed by us and/or our subsidiaries in connection with the development of utility-scale projects are generally subject to approval by the applicable state PUC. It cannot be assured that such PUC approval will be obtained, and in certain markets, including California and Nevada, the PUCs have recently demonstrated a heightened level of scrutiny on solar power purchase agreements that have come before the PUC for approval. If the required PUC approval is not obtained for any particular solar power purchase agreement, the utility counterparty may exercise its right to terminate such power purchase agreement, and we may lose its invested development capital.\nIf we fail to meet changing customer demands, we may lose customers and our sales could suffer.\nThe industries in which we operate change rapidly. Changes in our customers' requirements result in new and more demanding technologies, product specifications and sizes, and manufacturing processes. Our ability to remain competitive will depend upon our ability to develop technologically advanced products and processes. We must continue to meet the increasingly demanding requirements of our customers on a cost-effective basis. As a result, we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully introduce, market and cost-effectively manufacture any new products, or that we will be able to develop new or enhanced products and processes that satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance.\nRisks Related to Our Supply Chain and Supply Channels\nSignificant payments required from us under take-or-pay contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have long-term annual take-or-pay contracts with certain suppliers of precursor raw materials and solar wafers. If we fail to take the required minimum annual amounts under those contracts, we would be required to make payments to the relevant suppliers and those payments could be significant. In previous years, we have made significant payments to such suppliers because we did not take the required minimum volumes under those agreements, and we could have to make significant payments in the future if we do not take the required minimum annual amounts under those contracts.\nIn addition, the 2011 Global Plan necessitated termination of certain take-or-pay contracts with some of our suppliers of raw materials and solar wafers, which gave rise to disputes with those parties. In 2012, we entered into a settlement with one party, Evonik, resulting in our forfeiture of a $10.2 million deposit and an agreement by us to pay Evonik a total of 70 million euro. We may be required to make additional material payments in connection with the termination of other such contracts, including payments larger than management's current estimates of such obligations. On December 20, 2012, Wacker Chemie AG (\u201cWacker\u201d) filed a notice of arbitration with the Swiss Chambers\u2019 Arbitration Institution (the \u201cSCAI\u201d) against the company, requesting the resolution of a dispute arising from two agreements and a subsequent settlement agreement entered into between Wacker and the company. We estimate the range of reasonably possible losses for these take-or-pay contracts to be up to approximately $139.8 million, inclusive of the Wacker claim. These additional payments, if required in future years, could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. See Note 16, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in our 2014 Annual Reports.\nOur dependence on single and limited source suppliers and subcontractors in our Solar Energy and Semiconductor Materials businesses could harm our production output and adversely affect our manufacturing throughput and yield, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe obtain several raw materials, equipment, parts and supplies from sole suppliers. Likewise, we obtain all of our requirements for granular polysilicon from our facility in Pasadena, Texas. This dependence could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In the case of granular polysilicon, although we believe that we could substitute chunk polysilicon for granular polysilicon, we cannot predict whether this substitution would be successful or how long the related customer qualification process would take. In addition, with any material, unplanned change to increased use of chunk polysilicon as a substitute for granular polysilicon, our manufacturing process would be interrupted and our manufacturing throughput and yields would be adversely affected. A failure to obtain a new qualification or a decrease in our manufacturing throughput or yields could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced limited supplies of certain raw materials, equipment, parts and supplies. We may experience shortages of our key raw materials, equipment, parts and supplies in the future. A prolonged inability to manufacture or obtain raw materials, equipment, parts or supplies, or increases in prices resulting from shortages of these critical materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we often contract with subcontractors that convert our polysilicon into solar wafers which we, in turn, sell to our customers or provide for our own solar energy system projects. If module pricing increases and/or when capacity tightens, as it has in the past, we are forced to accept higher prices and less advantageous payment terms than we would accept in a more normalized supply-demand environment. These factors, which are often outside our control, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are currently dependent on a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain components for our solar energy systems. We also rely on third-party subcontractors to construct and install our solar energy systems, which could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, liquidated damages and loss of market share for our Solar Energy business.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain components for our solar power systems, such as inverters. If we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with these suppliers or if one of these suppliers goes out of business, we may be unable to install our solar power systems on time, or only at a higher cost or after a long delay, which could prevent us from delivering our solar power systems to our customers within required timeframes. Additionally if one of these suppliers goes out of business, the warranty and other services offered by such supplier may be reduced or eliminated, and we may be required to provide such warranty and services, which could increase our costs. To the extent the processes that our suppliers use to manufacture components are proprietary, we may be unable to obtain comparable components from alternative suppliers. The failure of a supplier to supply components in a timely manner, or at all, or to\nsupply components that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements, could impair our ability to install solar power systems or may increase our costs.\nWe utilize and rely on third party subcontractors to construct and install our solar energy systems throughout the world. If our subcontractors do not satisfy their obligations or do not perform work that meets our quality standards or if there is a shortage of third-party subcontractors or labor strikes that interfere with our subcontractors\u2019 ability to complete their work on time and/or on budget, we could experience significant delays in our construction operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and/or our ability to grow our Solar Energy project development business.\nCompliance with rules of the SEC relating to \"conflict minerals\u201d may require us and our suppliers to incur substantial expense and may result in disclosure by us that certain minerals used in products we manufacture or contract to manufacture are not \"DRC conflict free.\"\nSection 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act required the SEC to promulgate rules requiring disclosure by a public company of any \"conflict minerals\" (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by the public company. The SEC adopted final rules in 2012 which took effect at the end of January 2013. Because we manufacture or contract to manufacture products which may contain tin, tungsten, tantalum or gold, each year we are required under these rules to determine whether those minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of our products and, if so, conduct a country of origin inquiry with respect to all such minerals. If any such minerals may have originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or any of its adjoining countries (collectively referred to as \"covered countries\"), then we must conduct diligence on the source and chain of custody of those conflict minerals to determine if they did originate in one of the covered countries and, if so, whether they financed or benefited armed groups in the covered countries. Disclosures relating to the products which may contain conflict minerals, and the country of origin of those minerals and, possibly whether they are \u201cDRC conflict free\u201d must be provided in a Form SD (and accompanying conflict minerals report if one is required to disclose the diligence undertaken by us in sourcing the minerals and its conclusions relating to such diligence). If we are required to submit a conflict minerals report, after 2015 that report must be audited by an independent auditor pursuant to existing government auditing standards. Compliance with this new disclosure rule may be very time consuming for management and our supply chain personnel (as well as time consuming for our suppliers) and could involve the expenditure of significant amounts of money by us and them. Disclosures by us mandated by the new rules which are perceived by the market to be \u201cnegative\u201d may cause customers to refuse to purchase our products. There can be no assurance that the cost of compliance with the rule, including such market response to our disclosure will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nTwo of our subsidiaries are publicly traded corporations, SSL and TerraForm, which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic operations.\nSSL and TerraForm are publicly traded corporations. Our controlling interest in TerraForm and our continuing interest in SSL and the position of certain of our executive officers on the board of TerraForm and SSL may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to TerraForm and SSL. Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may fail to realize the benefits of our announced closings and restructurings.\nIn connection with the 2011 Global Plan, we reduced our total workforce by approximately 20%, shuttered the Company's, previously idled Merano, Italy polysilicon facility, reduced production capacity at the Company's Portland, Oregon crystal facility and slowed the ramp of the Kuching, Malaysia facility. We also previously committed to similar cost reduction actions in June 2011 and significant workforce reductions and facility realignment in 2009. We may be unable to achieve the total annualized cost savings and productivity improvements we currently anticipate from these activities. The timing of facility closings and related cost savings may be delayed due to the demand requirements and customer commitments in the semiconductor and solar industries. Failure to achieve expected savings, or delays in realizing the cost savings, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. See Note 13, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in our 2014 Annual Report.\nOur relocation of certain U.S. manufacturing operations to our Ipoh, Malaysia facility and expansion and construction of other manufacturing capacity presents business risks which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have invested significantly in expanding our polysilicon production capacity and our 300 millimeter production capacity; ramping our own solar wafer (156 millimeter) manufacturing facility in Kuching, Malaysia; forming SMP to produce high purity polysilicon; and relocating certain Semiconductor Materials manufacturing capacity to Ipoh, Malaysia. Expansion of 300 millimeter and 156 millimeter wafer manufacturing production capacity, ramping of our Ipoh, Malaysia semiconductor manufacturing facility, ramping our own solar wafering facility and startup of SMP are all subject to risks such as availability of capital equipment; delays in construction or installation and related technical difficulties in ramping such new capacity to significant production levels; availability of additional precursor raw materials; timing of production ramp; and qualification of new facilities for new and existing customers. The expansion of our 156 millimeter solar wafer manufacturing in Kuching, Malaysia is also subject to additional risks, including refining and adapting our manufacturing technologies to customer requirements, and establishing and maintaining sufficient internal research and development, marketing, sales, production and customer service infrastructure to support this effort.\nIn order to succeed in these expansions and relocations, we will need to devote the investment of management time and related resources to successfully execute these expansions and relocations. This could disrupt our existing business, affect our operating results and distract our management team. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully reach our production, timing and cost goals for our expansions and relocations as customer specifications and demand evolve. Use of capital and management resources that otherwise would have been made available to expand other parts of our business could have material adverse consequences on our results of operations if we fail to manage these expansions and relocations successfully.\nIf we do not continue to reduce our manufacturing costs and operating expenses, we may not be able to compete effectively in the semiconductor and solar wafer industries.\nThe success of our Semiconductor Materials and Solar Energy businesses depends, in part, on our continuous reduction of manufacturing costs and leveraging of operating expenses. If we are not able to reduce our manufacturing costs and leverage our operating expenses sufficiently to offset future price erosion, our operating results will be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce our manufacturing costs and leverage our operating expenses. Moreover, any future reduction of headcount or closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities may adversely affect our operational capabilities and our ability to manufacture wafers in required volumes to meet customer demand and may result in other production disruptions, or could require us to take an excess capacity or impairment charges, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. In our Solar Energy business, cost reductions on balance-of-system costs are also critical to our success in the downstream solar market.\nUnfair trade complaints filed by the U.S. against imports of solar cells from China and Taiwan and solar modules or panels manufactured or assembled in China using components from other countries, as well as unfair trade complaints filed by China against exports of solar-grade polysilicon from the U.S. and South Korea into China, could have significant negative effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn October 2011, a coalition of several U.S. solar companies filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Commerce (\"DOC\") and International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") charging that Chinese solar cell manufacturers have engaged in, and benefited from, various unfair trade practices. In June 2012, the DOC imposed duties on the import value of all modules using solar cells manufactured in China.\nIn September 2012, a similar trade case was filed by a coalition of several European solar companies in Europe. In December 2013, the Chinese exporters and association reached an agreement on a price undertaking arrangement with the European Commission, which imposed minimum export price and quantity restrictions on China\u2019s solar exports to European Union. (\u201cEU\u201d)\nIn July 2012, the China Ministry of Commerce (\"MOFCOM\") announced that it would investigate unfair trade practices related to solar-grade polysilicon imported into China from the U.S. and South Korea. SunEdison, through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, was one of the companies named in the MOFCOM petition. In January 2014, MOFCOM reached the final determination which imposed 53.7% antidumping duty and zero countervailing duty on solar-grade polysilicon manufactured and imported into China by this subsidiary. In addition to the investigation on imports from U.S. and South Korea, MOFCOM investigated the same product imported from the EU. In January 2014, MOFCOM announced preliminary determinations; but decided not to impose antidumping and countervailing provisional measure, the EU major exporter is negotiating with MOFCOM on a price undertaking arrangement.\nIn January 2014, the DOC initiated a new antidumping duty and countervailing duty investigations of solar cells manufactured in and imported from Taiwan and on modules manufactured in China, including solar modules or panels manufactured or assembled in China which use components from other countries. The DOC announced final countervailing duties and antidumping duties in February 2015.\nFinally, DOC is conducting an Administrative Review of the 2012 tariffs on Chinese cells and released a preliminary determination of lower tariffs in January 2015; the final determination is expected in Summer 2015.\nThese cases could have a significant impact on both the U.S. solar industry generally and our business specifically, which has relied, and is likely to rely in the future, on cells and/or modules imported from China or third countries subject to the above-mentioned cases for some of our SunEdison installations. To the extent that we are determined to be the \"importer of record\" in the United States or Europe of any solar cells or modules originating from China or Taiwan (under relevant rules of origin) the additional cost incurred by us directly in the form of import duties could be substantial. Even if we are not the importer of record, the import duties incurred by our suppliers could significantly increase the cost of cells or modules that we purchase. Similarly, the unfavorable outcome of the MOFCOM investigation could negatively impact the market price of solar-grade polysilicon and restricts our access to the Chinese solar market. The existence and outcome of any of these cases, or potential similar cases or retaliatory trade cases in other countries, could increase the cost of solar components and slow the use of renewable energy throughout the world. The outcome of the cases could also negatively affect specific transactions and negotiations between SunEdison and current and future Chinese and Taiwanese partners, suppliers and customers.\nThere are inherent uncertainties in these cases. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position or results of operations, or limit our ability to engage in certain of our business activities to the extent that we are currently intending to engage in such activities. Regardless of the outcome, we could suffer from disruptions to our normal business operations, and these issues could require significant attention from our management.\nOur expansion into emerging markets may expose us to legal, political, operational and other risks that could negatively affect our operations and profitability.\nWe continue to explore expansion of our international operations in certain markets where we currently operate and in selected new markets, such as Chile. Emerging market operations can present many risks including the actions and decisions of foreign authorities and regulators, the imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies, changes in laws (including tax laws and regulations), their application or interpretation, civil disturbances and political instability, difficulties in protecting intellectual property, changes in applicable currency, restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies, as well as other adverse actions by foreign governmental authorities and regulators, such as the retroactive application of new requirements on our current and prior activities or operations. Additionally, evaluating or entering into an emerging market may require considerable management time, as well as start-up expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated. Operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local political, economic and market conditions. As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. The impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nIf we fail to adequately manage our planned growth in our downstream Solar Energy business, our overall business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe expect the amount of our megawatts installed to continue to grow significantly over the next year. We expect that this growth will place significant stress on our operations, management, employee base and ability to meet capital requirements sufficient to support this growth over the next twelve months. Any failure to address the needs of our growing business successfully could have a negative impact on our chance of success.\nLarge scale solar projects in our Solar Energy business involve concentrated project development risks that may cause significant changes in our financial results.\nWe have been developing large solar projects involving significantly greater megawatt production than previous projects. These larger projects may create new operating and financial risks, as well as concentrate project development risks otherwise described in these risk factors. The effect of recognizing U.S. GAAP revenue and MWs completed on the sale of a larger project, including through percentage of completion accounting for certain projects, or the failure to recognize U.S. GAAP revenue as anticipated in a given reporting period because a project is not yet completed or sold under applicable accounting rules by period end, may materially impact our quarterly or annual financial results. These projects\nmay give rise to significant capital commitments which could materially affect cash flow. In addition, if approval by relevant state public utility commissions is delayed or denied or if construction, module delivery, financing, warranty or operational issues arise on a larger project, such issues could have a material impact on our financial results. Finally, we have built only a few such large scale projects in the past few years, and the management of a greater number of simultaneous projects represents a new test of our internal processes, external construction management, capital commitment process, project finance infrastructure and financing ability. The inability to successfully manage these large scale projects could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may incur unexpected warranty and performance guarantee claims that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with our products and our services, we may provide various product and system warranties and/or performance guarantees. For solar energy systems developed, built, and sold by us, we typically provide limited engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) performance guarantees and other warranties against defects in workmanship, engineering design, and installation services under normal use and service conditions for a period of one to two years, or more in certain circumstances, following the substantial completion of a solar energy system. While we generally are able to pass through manufacturer warranties we receive from our suppliers to our customers, in some circumstances, our warranty period may exceed the manufacturer's warranty period or the manufacturer warranties may not otherwise fully compensate for losses associated with customer claims pursuant to the warranty or performance guarantee we provided. For example, most manufacturer warranties exclude many losses that may result from a system component's failure or defect, such as the cost of de-installation, re-installation, shipping, lost electricity, lost renewable energy credits or other solar incentives, personal injury, property damage, and other losses. In addition, in the event we seek recourse through manufacturer warranties, we will also be dependent on the creditworthiness and continued existence of these suppliers. As a result, warranty or other performance guarantee claims against us could cause us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective products in our solar energy systems. Significant repair and replacement costs could materially and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations, as well as take up a lot of employee time remedying such issues. In addition, quality issues can have various other ramifications, including delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue, loss of future sales opportunities, increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products, and a negative impact on our reputation, all of which could also adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe loss of one or more of our customers, or failure of any of those customers to meet their obligations under agreements with us could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nAlthough only one customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2014, our operating results could materially suffer if we experience a significant reduction in, or loss of, purchases by our top customers.\nWe face competition in the industries in which we operate, which could force us to reduce our prices to retain market share or face losing market share and revenues.\nWe face competition in the renewable energy services provider market from E. On, Enel, NextEra, NRG, SunPower Corporation, First Solar, Inc., JUWI Solar Gmbh and Solar City. We also face competition in the polysilicon solar wafer and module industry from established manufacturers throughout the world, including Shin-Etsu Handotai, SUMCO Corporation, Siltronic AG and LG Siltron. Some of our competitors have substantial financial, technical, engineering and manufacturing resources to develop products that currently, and may, in the future, compete favorably against our products, and some of our competitors in the solar industry may have substantial government-backed financial resources. We expect that our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may need to reduce our prices to respond to aggressive pricing by our competitors to retain or gain market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBecause we cannot easily transfer production of specific products from one of our manufacturing facilities to another, manufacturing delays or lack of capacity or output at a single facility could result in a loss of product volume in our Semiconductor Materials and Solar Energy businesses.\nIt typically takes three to nine months for our customers to qualify a manufacturing facility to produce a specific product, but it can take longer depending upon a customer\u2019s requirements and market conditions. Interruption of operations or lack of available additional capacity at any of our primary wafer manufacturing facilities could result in delays or cancellations of shipments of wafers and a loss of product volume. Likewise, interruption of operations at our polysilicon manufacturing facility in Pasadena, Texas could adversely affect our semiconductor wafer manufacturing throughput and yields and could result in our inability to produce certain qualified wafer products, delays or cancellations of shipments of\nwafers and a loss of product volume. A number of factors could cause interruptions, including extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, which occur in the Pasadena, Texas area, earthquakes, equipment failures, shortages of raw materials or supplies, transportation logistic complications or labor disputes. We have had interruptions of our manufacturing operations for some of these reasons in the past, and could have such interruptions again in the future. Unions represent some of the employees at our wafer facilities in St. Peters, Missouri, Italy and South Korea and our granular polysilicon facility in Pasadena, Texas. A work shortage or slowdown at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in manufacturing. We cannot be certain that alternate qualified capacity would be available on a timely basis or at all.\nOur business may be harmed if we fail to properly protect our intellectual property.\nWe believe that the success of our business depends in part on our proprietary technology, information, processes and know how. We try to protect our intellectual property rights based on trade secrets and patents as part of our ongoing research, development and manufacturing activities. We cannot be certain, however, that we have adequately protected or will be able to adequately protect our technology, that our competitors will not be able to utilize our existing technology or develop similar technology independently, that the claims allowed with respect to any patents held by us will be broad enough to protect our technology, or that foreign intellectual property laws will adequately protect our intellectual property rights. Moreover, we cannot be certain that our patents provide us with a competitive advantage.\nAny litigation in the future to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know how possessed by us or to defend us or to indemnify others against claimed infringement of the rights of others could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we receive notices from other companies that allege we may be infringing certain of their patents or other rights. If we are unable to resolve these matters satisfactorily, or to obtain licenses on acceptable terms, we may face litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We are presently involved in a few cases involving allegations of patent infringement by us or by others. Regardless of the validity or successful outcome of any such intellectual property claims, we may need to expend significant time and expense to protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If we lose any such litigation where we are alleged to infringe the rights of others, we may be required to pay substantial damages, seek licenses from others, or change, or stop manufacturing or selling, some of our products. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in costly and time-consuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which require significant attention from our management.\nIn addition to litigation related to our intellectual property rights, we are named a defendant from time to time in other lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business, some of which may claim significant damages. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position, results of operations or cash flows or limit our ability to engage in certain of our business activities. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are often expensive, lengthy, disruptive to normal business operations and require significant attention from our management. We are currently, and may be subject in the future, to claims, lawsuits or arbitration proceedings related to matters in tort or under contracts, employment matters, securities class action lawsuits, tax authority examinations or other lawsuits, regulatory actions or government inquiries and investigations.\nOur inability to respond to rapid market changes in the solar energy industry, including identification of new technologies and their inclusion in the services that we offer, will adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe solar energy industry is characterized by rapid increases in the diversity and complexity of technologies, products and services. In particular, the ongoing evolution of technological standards requires products with lower costs and improved features, such as more efficiency and higher electricity output. If we fail to identify or obtain access to advances in technologies, we may become less competitive, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, we generally enter into long-term supply contracts and may hold a substantial inventory of solar modules and other related equipment that we utilize to provide our solar energy services. Rapid technological changes could result in components that we are contractually committed to purchase or our inventory becoming partially or entirely obsolete or not cost-effective, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant deterioration in the financial performance of the U.S. retail industry could materially adversely affect our Solar Energy business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial performance of our Solar Energy business in the United States depends in part upon the continued viability and financial stability of its retail customers. If the retail industry is materially and adversely affected by an economic downturn, increase in inflation or other factors, one or more of our largest customers could encounter financial difficulty, and possibly, bankruptcy. If one or more of our largest customers were to encounter financial difficulty or declare bankruptcy, they may reduce their power purchase agreement payments to us or stop them altogether. Any interruption or termination in payments by our customers would result in less cash being paid to the special purpose legal entities we establish to finance our projects, which could adversely affect the entities\u2019 ability to make lease payments to the financing parties which are the legal owners of many of our solar energy systems or to pay our lenders in the case of the solar energy systems that we own. In such a case, the amount of distributable cash held by the entities would decrease, adversely affecting the cash flows we receive from such entities. In addition, our ability to finance additional new projects with power purchase agreements from such customers would be adversely affected, undermining our ability to grow our business. Any reduction or termination of payments by one or more of our principal customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, which could require us to incur environmental liabilities, increase our manufacturing and related compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These environmental laws and regulations include those relating to the use, storage, handling, discharge, emission, disposal and reporting of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous materials used in our manufacturing processes. These materials may have been or could be released into the environment at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us, at other locations during the transport of the materials or at properties to which we send substances for treatment or disposal. If we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations or become non-compliant with permits required at some of our facilities, we could be held financially responsible and incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims. Groundwater and/or soil contamination has been detected at four of our facilities. We believe we are taking all necessary remedial steps at these facilities. In addition, if we should decide to close a facility in the future, we could be subject to additional costs related to cleanup and/or remediation of the facility in connection with closing the facility. We do not expect these known conditions to have a material impact on our business. Environmental issues relating to presently known or unknown matters, however, could require additional investigation, assessment or expenditures. In addition, new laws and regulations or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations could give rise to additional compliance costs and liabilities.\nAlthough we are not currently regulated as a utility under U.S. federal or state law or the laws and regulations of our foreign markets, we could become regulated as a utility company in the future.\nAs the owner of solar energy facilities in the United States, each of which has been certified as either a \"qualifying small power production facility\" or an \"exempt wholesale generator\", we currently are exempt from most federal and state standards, restrictions and regulatory requirements applicable to U.S. utility companies. As our utility-scale business grows, certain facilities may no longer be eligible for exemption from the rate-making provisions of the Federal Power Act, which would require compliance with public utility regulations. Similarly, although we are not currently subject to regulation as an electric utility in the foreign markets in which we provide our solar energy services, our business strategy includes the development of larger solar energy systems in the future which could change our regulatory position. Any local, state, federal or international regulations could place significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business and execute our business plan by prohibiting or otherwise restricting the sale of electricity by us. If we were deemed to be subject to the same state, federal or foreign regulatory authorities as utility companies, such as FERC in the United States, or if new regulatory bodies were established to oversee the solar energy industry in the United States or in our foreign markets, our operating costs could materially increase, adversely affecting our results of operations.\nOur brand and reputation are key assets of our business, and if our brand or reputation is damaged, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend significantly on our reputation for high quality semiconductor materials, solar wafers, solar energy systems and the brand names \"SunEdison\" to retain our current customers and attract new customers and joint venture partners in order to grow our business. If we fail to deliver our products or solar energy systems within the planned timelines, our products and services do not perform as anticipated or if we materially damage any of our clients' properties, or cancel projects, our brand name and reputation could be significantly impaired, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management and cause dilution to our stockholders.\nWe have made several acquisitions in the last several years, and in the future we may acquire additional companies, project pipelines, products, or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and each acquisition has numerous risks. These risks include the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies;\n\u2022difficulty in achieving profitable commercial scale from acquired technologies;\n\u2022difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures, and policies during the transition and integration;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and associates from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues;\n\u2022inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022inability to retain key customers, vendors, and other business partners of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ninability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses, as a result of insufficient capital resources or otherwise;\n\u2022\nincurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;\n\u2022\npotential impairment of our relationships with our associates, customers, partners, distributors, or third party providers of technology or products;\n\u2022\npotential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, legal and financial liabilities, among other things;\n\u2022potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective;\n\u2022\npotential inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions; and\n\u2022potential delay in customer purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings.\nMergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Relationship with TerraForm (\"TERP\")\nThe growth of TERP's business depends on their ability to locate and acquire interests in additional, attractive clean energy power generation facilities from the Company and unaffiliated third parties at favorable prices.\nTERP's primary business strategy is to acquire clean energy power generation facilities that are operational from both\nthe Company and third parties. TERP may also, in limited circumstances, acquire clean energy projects that are pre-operational. The following factors, among others, could affect the availability of attractive power generation facilities to grow TERP's business:\n\u2022\ncompeting bids for a power generating facility, including from companies that may have substantially greater capital and other resources than TERP does;\n\u2022\nfewer third-party acquisition opportunities than TERP expects, which could result from, among other things, available power generation facilities having less desirable economic returns or higher risk profiles than they believe suitable for its business plan and investment strategy;\n\u2022\nour failure to complete the development of the Call Right Projects or any of the other projects in our development pipeline, which could result from, among other things, permitting challenges, failure to procure the requisite financing, equipment or interconnection, or an inability to satisfy the conditions to effectiveness of project agreements such as PPAs, which could limit TERP's acquisition opportunities under the Support Agreement or the Intercompany Agreement; and\n\u2022\nTERP's failure to exercise its rights under the Support Agreement or the Intercompany Agreement to acquire assets from the Company.\nTERP will not be able to achieve its target compound annual growth rate of CAFD per unit unless they are able to acquire additional clean energy power generation facilities at favorable prices.\nWe are the our controlling stockholder over TERP and exercise substantial influence over TERP, and TERP is highly dependent on us.\nWe beneficially own all of TERP's outstanding Class B common stock. Each share of TERP's outstanding Class B\ncommon stock entitles SunEdison 10 votes on all matters presented to TERP's stockholders. As a result of our ownership of TERP's Class B common stock, we possess approximately 91% of the combined voting power of TERP's stockholders even though we only own 50% of total shares outstanding (inclusive of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class B1 common stock). We have expressed our intention to maintain a controlling interest in TERP going forward. As a result of this ownership, we have a substantial influence on TERP's affairs and our voting power will constitute a large percentage of any quorum of TERP's stockholders voting on any matter requiring the approval of its stockholders. Such matters include the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and approval of mergers or sale of all or substantially all of TERP's assets. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares. In addition, we, for so long as we and our controlled affiliates possess a majority of the combined voting power, has the power to appoint all of TERP's directors. We also have a right to specifically designate up to two additional directors to TERP's board of directors until such time as we and our controlled affiliates cease to own shares representing a majority voting power in TERP. We may cause corporate actions to be taken even if our interests conflict with the interests of TERP's other stockholders (including holders of our Class A common stock).\nFurthermore, TERP depends on the management and administration services provided by or under the direction of SunEdison under the Management Services Agreement. Other than personnel designated as dedicated to TERP, our personnel and support staff that provide services to TERP under the Management Services Agreement are not required to, and TERP does not expect that our personnel and support staff will, have as their primary responsibility the management and administration of TERP's business or act exclusively for TERP. Under the Management Services Agreement, we have the discretion to determine which of our employees, other than the designated TerraForm personnel, will perform assignments required to be provided to TERP under the Management Services Agreement. Any failure to effectively manage TERP's operations or to implement their strategy could have a material adverse effect on TERP's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. The Management Services Agreement will continue in perpetuity, until terminated in accordance with its terms. The non-compete provisions of the Management Services Agreement will survive termination indefinitely. In addition, in connection with our financing activities, we have pursued and may pursue various transactions that may impact TERP or the value of its Class A common stock, including pledges of TERP's common stock held by us or our affiliates to secure debt or other obligations. In addition, we may enter into agreements with financing entities for the construction and operation of Class Right Projects that could include obligations by TERP to purchase Call Right Projects in certain limited circumstances.\nThe Support Agreement provides TERP the option to purchase additional solar projects that have Projected FTM CAFD of at least $75.0 million from the completion of our IPO through the end of 2015 and $100.0 million during 2016, representing aggregate additional Projected FTM CAFD of $175.0 million. The Support Agreement also provides TERP a right of first offer with respect to the ROFO Projects. Additionally, TERP depends upon us for the provision of management and administration services at all of our facilities. Any failure by us to perform its requirements under these arrangements or the failure by TERP to identify and contract with replacement service providers, if required, could adversely affect the operation of TERP's facilities and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe may offer certain Call Right Projects to third parties or remove Call Right Projects identified in the Support Agreement and TERP must still agree on a number of additional matters covered by the Support Agreement.\nPursuant to the Support Agreement, we have provided TERP with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase for cash certain solar generation facilities from our project pipeline with aggregate Projected FTM CAFD (as defined below) of at least $175.0 million by the end of 2016. The Support Agreement identifies certain such facilities, which we believe will collectively satisfy a majority of the total Projected FTM CAFD commitment. We may, however, remove a project from the Call Right Project list effective upon notice to TERP, if, in its reasonable discretion, a project is unlikely to be successfully completed. In that case, we will be required to replace such project with one or more additional reasonably equivalent projects that have a similar economic profile. Additionally, in connection with the First Wind acquisition, we entered into the Intercompany Agreement with TERP, under which we granted TERP additional call rights with respect to certain power plants in the First Wind pipeline, which represent an additional 1.6 GW of wind and solar generation assets. These additional Call Right Projects under the Intercompany Agreement do not go towards satisfying our $175.0 million CAFD commitment.\nAs of February 20, 2015, the total nameplate capacity of the power plants to which TERP has call rights under both the Intercompany Agreement and the Support Agreement is over 3.3 GW.\nThe Support Agreement also provides that we are required to offer TERP additional qualifying Call Right Projects from our pipeline on a quarterly basis until TERP has acquired Call Right Projects that are projected to generate the specified minimum amount of Projected FTM CAFD for each of the periods covered by the Support Agreement. These additional Call Right Projects must satisfy certain criteria, include being subject to a fully-executed PPA with a counterparty that, in our reasonable discretion, is creditworthy. The price for each Call Right Project will be the fair market value. The Support Agreement provides that we will work with TERP to mutually agree on the fair market value and Projected FTM CAFD of each Call Right Project within a reasonable time after it is added to the list of identified Call Right Projects. If we are unable to agree on the fair market value or Projected FTM CAFD for a project within 90 calendar days after it is added to the list (or such shorter period as will still allow us to complete the call right exercise process), we or TERP, upon written notice from either party, will engage a third-party advisor to determine the disputed item so that such material economic terms reflect common practice in the relevant market. The other economic terms with respect to our purchase of a Call Right Project will also be determined by mutual agreement or, if we are unable to reach agreement, by a third-party advisor. We may not achieve all of the expected benefits from the Support Agreement if we are unable to mutually agree with TERP with respect to these matters. Until the price for a Call Right Project is agreed or determined, in the event we receive a bona fide offer for a Call Right Project from a third party, TERP has the right to match the price offered by such third party and acquire such Call Right Project on the terms we could obtain from the third party. In addition, TERP's effective remedies under the Support Agreement may also be limited in the event that a material dispute with us arises under the terms of the Support Agreement.\nIn addition, we have agreed to grant TERP a right of first offer on any of the ROFO Projects that we determine to sell or otherwise transfer during the six-year period following the completion of TERP's IPO. Under the terms of the Support Agreement, we agree to negotiate with TERP in good faith, for a period of 30 days, to reach an agreement with respect to any proposed sale of a ROFO Project for which TERP has exercised its right of first offer before we may sell or otherwise transfer such ROFO Project to a third party. However, we will not be obligated to sell any of the ROFO Projects and, as a result, TERP does not know when, if ever, any ROFO Projects will be offered to them. Furthermore, in the event that we elect to sell ROFO Projects, we will not be required to accept any offer TERP makes and may choose to sell the assets to a third party or not sell the assets at all.\nThe IDRs may be transferred to a third party without the consent of TerraForm, holders of Terra LLC\u2019s units, or the TerraForm board of directors (or any committee thereof).\nWe may not sell, transfer, exchange, pledge (other than as collateral under its credit facilities) or otherwise dispose of the IDRs to any third party (other than its controlled affiliates) until after it has satisfied its $175.0 million aggregate Projected FTM CAFD commitment to us in accordance with the Support Agreement. We will pledge the IDRs as collateral under its existing credit agreement concurrently with the consummation of this offering, but the IDRs may not be transferred upon foreclosure until after we have satisfied its Projected FTM CAFD commitment to us. After that period, we may transfer the IDRs to a third party at any time without the consent of the TerraForm, holders of Terra LLC\u2019s units, or the TerraForm board of directors (or any committee thereof). However, our Sponsor has granted us a right of first refusal with respect to any proposed sale of IDRs to a third party (other than its controlled affiliates), which we may exercise to purchase the IDRs proposed to be sold on the same terms offered to such third party at any time within 30 days after we receive written notice of the proposed sale and its terms. If we transfer the IDRs to a third party, we would not have the same incentive to grow our business and increase quarterly distributions to holders of Class A common stock over time. For example, a transfer of IDRs by us could reduce the likelihood of our accepting offers made by us relating to assets owned by our Sponsor, as it would have less of an economic incentive to grow our business, which in turn would impact our ability to grow our portfolio.\nWe may incur additional costs or delays in completing the construction of certain generation facilities, which could materially adversely affect our growth strategy dividend and IDR distributions.\nTERP's growth strategy is dependent to a significant degree on acquiring new solar energy projects from us and third parties. We or such third parties\u2019 failure to complete such projects in a timely manner, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on TERP's growth strategy. The construction of solar energy facilities involves many risks including:\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, necessary permits and licenses;\n\u2022\ndelays and increased costs related to the interconnection of new generation facilities to the transmission system;\n\u2022\nthe inability to acquire or maintain land use and access rights;\n\u2022\nthe failure to receive contracted third party services;\n\u2022\ninterruptions to dispatch at TERP's facilities;\n\u2022\nsupply interruptions;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes;\n\u2022\nweather interferences;\n\u2022\nunforeseen engineering, environmental and geological problems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated cost overruns in excess of budgeted contingencies;\n\u2022\nfailure of contracting parties to perform under contracts, including engineering, procurement and construction contractors; and\n\u2022\noperations and maintenance costs not covered by warranties or that occur following expiration of warranties.\nAny of these risks could cause a delay in the completion of projects under development, which could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy.\nWe and other developers of solar energy projects depend on a limited number of suppliers of solar panels, inverters, modules and other system components. Any shortage, delay or component price change from these suppliers could result in construction or installation delays, which could affect the number of solar projects TERP is able to acquire in the future.\nOur solar projects are constructed with solar panels, inverters, modules and other system components from a limited number of suppliers, making us susceptible to quality issues, shortages and price changes. If we or third parties from whom TERP acquires solar projects or other clean power generation projects in the future fail to develop, maintain and expand relationships with these or other suppliers, or if they fail to identify suitable alternative suppliers in the event of a disruption with existing suppliers, the construction or installation of new solar energy projects or other clean power generation projects may be delayed or abandoned, which would reduce the number of available projects that we may have the opportunity to acquire in the future.\nThere have also been periods of industry-wide shortage of key components, including solar panels, in times of rapid industry growth. The manufacturing infrastructure for some of these components has a long lead time, requires significant capital investment and relies on the continued availability of key commodity materials, potentially resulting in an inability to meet demand for these components. In addition, the United States government has imposed tariffs on solar cells manufactured in China. Based on determinations by the United States government, the applicable anti-dumping tariff rates range from approximately 8% to 239%. To the extent that United States market participants experience harm from Chinese pricing practices, an additional tariff of approximately 15%-16% will be applied. If we or other unaffiliated third parties purchase solar panels containing cells manufactured in China, our purchase price for projects would reflect the tariff penalties mentioned above. A shortage of key commodity materials could also lead to a reduction in the number of projects that we may have the opportunity to acquire in the future, or delay or increase the costs of acquisitions.\nTERP's organizational and ownership structure may create significant conflicts of interest that may be resolved in a manner that is not in their best interests or the best interests of holders of TERP's Class A common stock and that may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nTERP's organizational and ownership structure involves a number of relationships that may give rise to certain conflicts of interest between them and its holders of its Class A common stock, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand. We have entered into the Management Services Agreement with TERP. TERP's executive officers are employees of the Company and certain of them will continue to have equity interests in the Company and, accordingly, the benefit to us from a transaction between us and TERP will proportionately inure to their benefit as holders of equity interests in the Company. We are a related party under the applicable securities laws governing related party transactions and may have interests which differ from TERP's interests or those of holders of TERP's Class A common stock, including with respect to the types of acquisitions made, the timing and amount of dividends by TerraForm, the reinvestment of returns generated by TERP's operations, the use of leverage when making acquisitions and the appointment of outside advisors and service providers. Any material transaction between us and TERP (including the acquisition of the Call Right Projects and any ROFO Projects) are subject to our related party transaction policy, which will require prior approval of such transaction by our Corporate Governance Committee. Those of our executive officers who have economic interests in TERP may be conflicted when advising our Corporate Governance Committee or otherwise participating in the negotiation or approval of such transactions. These executive officers have significant project- and industry-specific expertise that could prove beneficial to our Corporate Governance Committee\u2019s decision-making process and the absence of such strategic guidance could have a material adverse effect on the Corporate Governance Committee\u2019s ability to evaluate any such transaction. Furthermore, the Corporate Governance Committee and our related party transaction approval policy may not insulate us\nfrom derivative claims related to related party transactions and the conflicts of interest described in this risk factor. Regardless of the merits of such claims, we may be required to expend significant management time and financial resources in the defense thereof. Additionally, to the extent we fail to appropriately deal with any such conflicts, it could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur liability is limited under our arrangements with TERP and TERP has agreed to indemnify us against claims that it may face in connection with such arrangements, which may lead us to assume greater risks when making decisions relating to TERP than it otherwise would if acting solely for our own account.\nUnder the Management Services Agreement, we will not assume any responsibility other than to provide or arrange for the provision of the services described in the Management Services Agreement in good faith. In addition, under the Management Services Agreement, the liability of the Company and its affiliates will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law to conduct involving bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence or, in the case of a criminal matter, action that was known to have been unlawful. In addition, TERP has agreed to indemnify us to the fullest extent permitted by law from and against any claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses incurred by an indemnified person or threatened in connection with our operations, investments and activities or in respect of or arising from the Management Services Agreement or the services provided by us, except to the extent that the claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses are determined to have resulted from the conduct in respect of which such persons have liability as described above. These protections may result in SunEdison tolerating greater risks when making decisions than otherwise would be the case, including when determining whether to use leverage in connection with acquisitions. The indemnification arrangements to which we are a party may also give rise to legal claims for indemnification that are adverse to TERP or holders of its Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nIf we fail to comply with covenants under our credit facilities, the lenders could cause outstanding amounts to become immediately due and payable, and we might not have sufficient funds and assets to pay such loans.\nOn February 28, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with the lenders identified therein, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint syndication agents, and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., as joint bookrunners (as amended from time to time the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility provides for a senior secured letter of credit facility in an aggregate principal amount up to $540 million. On January 27, 2015, in connection with the First Wind Acquisition, we issued $460 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due April 15, 2022 (the \"2022 Notes\"). In addition, we previously issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due January 15, 2020 (the \"2020 Notes\"), $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due October 1, 2018 (the \"2018 Notes\") and $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due January 1, 2021 (together with the 2022 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes, the \"Convertible Notes\"), which remain outstanding.\nOn January 29, 2015, in connection with the First Wind Acquisition, our wholly owned subsidiary, SUNE ML 1, LLC (the \u201cMargin Loan SPV\u201d), entered into a Margin Loan Agreement (the \u201cMargin Loan Agreement\u201d) providing for the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $410 million in term loans. We have guaranteed all of the Margin Loan SPV\u2019s obligations under the Margin Loan Agreement. Also on January 29, 2015 in connection with the First Wind Acquisition, our wholly owned subsidiary, Seller Note LLC (\u201cSeller Note SPV\u201d) issued $336.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Guaranteed Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2020 (the \u201cExchangeable Notes\u201d). We have guaranteed all of the Seller Note SPV\u2019s obligations under the Exchangeable Notes.\nWe may request increases in the Credit Facility and enter into additional facilities in the future to support our growth plan. These facilities contain certain restrictive covenants and conditions, including a no-material-adverse-change drawing condition in the Credit Facility, and we expect future facilities will have similar restrictive covenants, including cross-default provisions affecting other instruments of indebtedness. A violation of any of these covenants, which in our industries could occur in a sudden or sustained downturn, would be deemed an event of default under the facilities. In such event, upon election of the lenders, the loan commitments under the credit facilities would terminate and the indebtedness and accrued interest then-outstanding would be due and payable immediately (or, in the case of letters of credit, subject to cash collateralization). We may not have sufficient funds and assets to cover any such required payments and may not be able to obtain replacement financing on a timely basis or at all. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, depending on our outstanding balances at that time. We have also had to negotiate changes to our covenants in the past and may need to do so again in the future, with no assurances that we will be able to do so. As of December 31, 2014, we had\napproximately $519 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under our Solar Energy Facility and $1,800 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Convertible Notes.\nOur long-term indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $3,288.1 million of non-recourse long-term debt related to our solar energy systems. In addition, we are bound by the Credit Facility, the Margin Loan Agreement and the Convertible Notes. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to invest operating cash flow in our operations due to debt service requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital expenditures, product development or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our operational flexibility due to the covenants contained in our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to make required investments in our joint ventures;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dispose of significant assets in order to satisfy our debt service obligations;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or industry, thereby limiting our ability to compete with companies that are not as highly leveraged; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to economic downturns and changing market conditions.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt service obligations will depend on the factors described above, as well as our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in consumer preferences, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell our assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to, at any given time, refinance our debt, sell our assets, borrow more money or raise equity on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to fund our day-to-day operations or to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our Credit Facility and other debt instruments restrict our ability to dispose of certain assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, holders of Convertible Notes and Exchangeable Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our debt facilities could terminate their commitments or foreclose against the assets securing our borrowings or require that all letters of credit be cash collateralized, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, in each case, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictive covenants in our Credit Facility may limit our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies.\nThe terms of certain of our indebtedness, including our Credit Facility, contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions,\nincluding restrictions on our ability to take actions that we believe may be in our interest. In addition, our Credit Facility limits our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments;\n\u2022\nenter into certain agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments; and\n\u2022\nmake certain payments on indebtedness.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under our Credit Facility could result in a default. Such default may allow the creditors to cash collateralize letters of credit and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event our lenders and note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we cannot assure you that we and our subsidiaries would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness.\nThe restrictions contained in the agreements governing our other indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to:\n\u2022\nfinance our operations;\n\u2022\nmake needed capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nmake strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances;\n\u2022\nwithstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general;\n\u2022\nengage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and\n\u2022\nplan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\nOur financial results and our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing.\nIn connection with the First Wind acquisition, we expect to incur significant additional indebtedness and have assumed certain of First Wind's outstanding indebtedness, which could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility, and will increase our interest expense.\nWe will have substantially increased indebtedness as a result of the First Wind acquisition in comparison to our indebtedness on a recent historical basis, which could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing our interest expense. We will also incur various costs and expenses associated with the financing. The amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness following completion of the First Wind acquisition, and thus the demands on our cash resources, will be greater than the amount of cash flow required to service out indebtedness prior to the transaction. The increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the First Wind acquisition could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If we do not achieve the expected benefits from the First Wind acquisition, or if our financial performance after completion of the Fist Wind acquisition does not meet current expectations, then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.\nMoreover, we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. Our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nThe agreements that will govern the new indebtedness in connection with the First Wind acquisition, or any indebtedness of First Wind we may assume, are expected to contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that may affect our ability to operate our business.\nThe agreements that will govern the new indebtedness in connection with the Fist Wind acquisition, or any indebtedness of First Wind we assumed, are expected to contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to, among other things, have liens on our property, change the nature of our business, and/or acquire, merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or\nconvey certain of our assets to any one person. Our and our subsidiaries ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt, including secured debt, in the future.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future. Although our Credit Facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. The additional debt that we and our subsidiaries may obtain in the future could intensify the risk that we may not be able to fulfill our obligations under the Convertible Notes, the Exchangeable Notes, the Credit Facility, the Margin Loan Agreement or other financing arrangements.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, is the subject of complex accounting principles requiring significant judgments that could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as our Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.\nIn addition, if certain criteria are satisfied, convertible debt instruments (such as our Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. If we do not satisfy the criteria required to utilize the treasury stock method, we will be required to determine diluted earnings per share utilizing the \u201cif converted\u201d method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share assuming the conversion of the notes at the beginning of the reporting period if the impact is dilutive.\nAdditionally, under the \u201cif-converted\u201d method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, interest expense associated with the notes is added back to the numerator of calculation. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. Additionally, we cannot be sure that we will satisfy the relevant criteria to utilize the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nCapital and Financial Market Risks\nWe need to obtain additional project financing to implement our current business plan. The failure to obtain such financing may restrict our ability to grow.\nOur current capital and revolving credit facilities are not sufficient to enable us to execute our current business plans, and we will be required to obtain additional project financing for our planned solar energy projects. We may not have funds sufficient for additional investments in our business that we might want to undertake. We will require additional capital in the near term, and we continue to look for opportunities to optimize our capital structure. We plan to pursue sources of such capital through various financing transactions and arrangements, including debt financing, equity financing, joint venturing of projects or other means. We may not be successful in locating suitable financing transactions in the time period required or at all, or on terms we find attractive, and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means. If we do succeed in raising additional capital, the capital received may not be sufficient to fund our operations going forward without obtaining further additional financing. In addition, debt and possible mezzanine financing may involve a pledge of assets and may be senior to equity holders.\nOur ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by conditions in the capital markets (both generally and in our industries in particular). Some of the contractual arrangements governing our operations may require us to maintain minimum capital, and we may lose our contract rights if we do not have the required minimum capital. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities is insufficient, we may be required to curtail our business plans. However, in the event we are unable to find additional financing opportunities, we believe we will be able to adjust our operating plans to execute our business plans for at least the next twelve months.\nBecause we manufacture and sell a substantial portion of our products outside of the United States, we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including periodic foreign economic downturns and political instability, which may adversely affect our sales and cost of doing business in those regions of the world.\nEconomic downturns have affected our operating results in the past and could affect our operating results in the future. Additionally, other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future, including:\n\u2022\nthe imposition of governmental controls or changes in government regulations, including tax regulations;\n\u2022\nexport license requirements;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the export of technology;\n\u2022\nexpropriation;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. and international laws involving international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and export control laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving headcount reductions;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on transfers of funds and assets between jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ngeo-political instability; and\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions and changes in tariffs.\nWe cannot predict whether these economic risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nWe currently operate under tax holidays and/or favorable tax incentives and rates in certain foreign jurisdictions. Such tax holidays and incentives often require us to meet certain minimum employment and investment criteria or thresholds in these jurisdictions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to meet these criteria or thresholds or realize any net tax benefits from these tax holidays or incentives. If any of our tax holidays or incentives are terminated, our results of operations could be materially adversely effected.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks because certain of our operations are located in foreign countries.\nWe generate a portion of our revenues and incur a portion of our costs in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Changes in economic or political conditions in any of the countries in which we operate could result in exchange rate movement, new currency or exchange controls or other restrictions being imposed on our operations or expropriation. Because our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, if we generate revenue or earnings in other currencies, the translation of those results into U.S. dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those revenues or earnings. To the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nCertain of our foreign subsidiaries have debt service requirements denominated in U.S. dollars while corresponding cash flows are generated in other foreign currencies and therefore significant changes in the value of such foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on debts denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, we have intercompany loans denominated in U.S. dollars with certain of our foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other that the U.S. dollar.\nIn addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risks whenever we or one of our subsidiaries enter into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity.\nGiven the volatility of exchange rates, we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction or translation risks. It is possible that volatility in currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We expect to experience economic losses and gains and negative and\npositive impacts on earnings as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We expect that our revenues denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies will continue to increase in future periods.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nConflicts of interest between SSL or TerraForm and us might be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us.\nFollowing completion of the SSL and TerraForm IPOs, various conflicts of interest between SSL and TerraForm and us could arise. One of our officers is a director of SSL and three officers and one director of the Company serve on the board of TerraForm. Furthermore, certain of our officers and directors may own stock in SSL and/or TerraForm. A person\u2019s service as either a director or officer of SunEdison as well as SSL or TerraForm, or ownership interests of our directors or officers in SSL and/or TerraForm shares, could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when those directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for SunEdison, SSL and TerraForm. These decisions could, for example, relate to:\n\u2022\ncorporate opportunities;\n\u2022\nour financing and dividend policy;\n\u2022\ncompensation and benefit programs and other human resources policy decisions;\n\u2022\ntermination of, changes to or determinations under our agreements with SSL and TerraForm entered into in connection with the IPOs; and\n\u2022\ndeterminations with respect to our tax returns.\nPotential conflicts of interest could also arise in connection with any new commercial arrangements with SSL or TerraForm in the future.. Our directors and officers who have interests in SSL or TerraForm and us may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between SSL or TerraForm and us.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the SSL and TerraForm IPOs.\nWe may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the SSL and TerraForm IPOs or such benefits may be delayed. If we are unable to achieve the strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the SSL and TerraForm IPOs our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we continue to consolidate SSL and TerraForm in our consolidated financial statements. Since the respective boards of directors of SSL and TerraForm owe fiduciary duties to the stockholders of SSL and TerraForm, their actions may not always be in our best interests. Accordingly, their actions may lead to outcomes that cause our consolidated financial statements, after consolidating SSL's and TerraForm's financial statements, to make it difficult to obtain needed financing or to do so on unfavorable terms.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we continue to consolidate the financial statements of SSL and TerraForm into our own. This in turn will cause the total assets and liabilities on our balance sheet to appear larger than they would otherwise and our statement of operations to reflect larger revenues and expenses than would be the case absent consolidation. However, since the operations of SSL and TerraForm are also impacted by the respective boards of directors of SSL and TerraForm, who will owe fiduciary duties to the stockholders of SSL and TerraForm, respectively, their actions could lead to outcomes that have a material negative impact on their operations or financial condition. As a result of consolidation, this would impact our results of operations and financial condition, thereby potentially impacting our ability to obtain needed financing for our operations or our ability to do so on favorable terms.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our forward-looking statements and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements.\nFrom time to time, we present, in press releases, furnished reports on Form 8-K, and otherwise, forward-looking statements regarding our future performance and market conditions. These statements represent management\u2019s estimates as of their date and are qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in such presentations. Projections and other forward-looking statements are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Projections and other forward-looking statements are necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the forward-looking\nstatements furnished by us will not prove to be accurate or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our projections and other forward-looking statements are only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the projections and the variations may be material. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is projected. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon, or otherwise consider, our projections or other forward-looking statements, including those set forth in this prospectus supplement or in the investor presentation referred to above, in making an investment decision in respect of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly, especially in recent years, and may continue to do so in the future, which increases the risk of your investment.\nWe are a participant in both the renewable energy industry and the semiconductor industry, two industries that have often experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of an individual company. This market volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock may be affected by various factors, including:\n\u2022\nquarterly fluctuations in our operating results resulting from factors such as timing of orders from and shipments to major customers, product mix, competitive pricing pressures and sales of solar energy systems;\n\u2022\nour ability to convert our pipeline and backlog into completed solar energy systems at historical or anticipated rates;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions experienced by our customers and in the semiconductor industry and solar industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements of operating results that are not aligned with the expectations of investors;\n\u2022\ngeneral worldwide macroeconomic conditions, including availability of project financing and related interest rates, or changes in government policies regarding solar energy;\n\u2022\nchanges in our relationships with our customers;\n\u2022\nseasonality of our Solar Energy business;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products or upgrades to existing products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ninterruption of operations at our manufacturing facilities or the facilities of our suppliers; and\n\u2022\ndevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights by us or by our competitors.\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price fluctuations. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe accounting treatment for many aspects of our Solar Energy business is complex and any changes to the accounting interpretations or accounting rules governing our Solar Energy business could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. GAAP reported results of operations and financial results.\nThe accounting treatment for many aspects of our Solar Energy business is complex, and our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the accounting treatment applicable to our Solar Energy business. In particular, any changes to the accounting rules regarding the following matters may require us to change the manner in which we operate and finance our Solar Energy business:\n\u2022\nthe classification of our sale-leaseback transactions as operating, capital or real estate financing transactions;\n\u2022\nrevenue recognition and related timing;\n\u2022\nintracompany contracts;\n\u2022\noperation and maintenance contracts;\n\u2022\njoint venture accounting, including the consolidation of joint venture entities and the inclusion or exclusion of their assets and liabilities on our balance sheet;\n\u2022\nlong-term vendor agreements; and\n\u2022\nforeign holding company tax treatment.\nWe make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our 2014 Annual Report. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nIntegrating the assets we acquired in the First Wind acquisition may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits of the First Wind acquisition may not be realized.\nThe success of the First Wind acquisition, including anticipated benefits, will depend, in part, on our and our subsidiaries' ability to successfully develop, combine and integrate those assets with our existing operations. In addition, the acquisition of the wind projects represents a substantial change in the nature of our business, and we may not be able to adapt the such change in a timely manner, or at all. It is possible that the First Wind acquisition or the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, higher than expected costs, diversion of management attention and resources, the disruption of either company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company's ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors and employees or the achieve the anticipated benefits of the First Wind acquisition. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the First Wind acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Management continues to refine its integration plan, which may vary from plans previously disclosed. These\nintegration matters could have an adverse effect during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the First Wind acquisition.\nThe First Wind acquisition will involve substantial costs.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring costs associated with the First Wind acquisition. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will be comprised of transaction and regulatory costs related to the First Wind acquisition. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the First Wind acquisition.\nAny future strategic acquisitions we make could have a dilutive effect on your investment, and if the goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-term assets recorded in connection with such acquisitions become impaired, we would be required to record additional impairment charges, which may be significant.\nIn the event of any future acquisitions, we may record a portion of the assets we acquire as goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets. We do not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, but rather review them for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverability of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future earnings and cash flows. Changes in estimates, circumstances or conditions, resulting from both internal and external factors, could have a significant impact on our fair valuation determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge negatively affecting our results of operations.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities if we need to raise capital in connection with a capital raise or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with a capital raise or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock.\nConversion of our outstanding convertible notes and our warrants related to our convertible notes could dilute ownership and earnings per share or cause the market price of our stock to decrease.\nTo the extent we issue common shares upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes, the conversion of some or all of such notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their notes. Any sales in the public market of the common shares issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of our outstanding\nconvertible notes may encourage short selling of our common stock by market participants who expect that the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had issued warrants to affiliates of the underwriters of our convertible notes, which are exercisable for a total of approximately 104.4 million shares of our common stock. The warrants, together with certain convertible hedge transactions, are meant to reduce our exposure upon potential conversion of our convertible notes. If the market price of our common stock exceeds the respective exercise prices of the warrants, such warrants will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, and could dilute the ownership interests for existing stockholders if exercised.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the notes or purchase the notes as required upon a fundamental change, and our existing debt contains, and our future debt may contain, limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the notes.\nFollowing a fundamental change as described under \"Description of the Notes-Purchase of Notes at Your Option upon a fundamental Change, \" holders of notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes for cash. A fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or prepayment under, and result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our then-existing indebtedness. In addition, upon conversion of the notes, unless we are permitted, which will only occur if and when we obtain the stockholder approval described in this offering memorandum, and elect, to settle our conversion obligation in solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being surrendered for conversion as described under \"Description of the Notes-Conversion of Notes-Settlement upon Conversion.\" We may, in certain circumstances, irrevocably elect to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to each subsequent conversion date in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, if any, with a particular \"specified dollar amount\" (as defined in this offering memorandum), in which case we will no longer be permitted to settle the corresponding portion of our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock. However, until we obtain the stockholder approvals described in this offering memorandum, we must settle conversions solely in cash. We may not have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange for purchase upon a fundamental change or make cash payments upon conversions. In addition, restrictions in our then-existing credit facilities or other indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to purchase the notes upon a fundamental change or make cash payments upon conversions. In addition, restrictions in our then-existing credit facilities or other indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to purchase the notes upon a fundamental change or make cash payments upon conversions of the notes. Our failure to purchase the notes upon a fundamental change (when required) or to make cash payments upon conversions thereof for five business days after such payments have become due would result in an event of default with respect to the notes, which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nWe are required to evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any adverse results from such evaluation, or the failure to develop internal controls necessary for our newly acquired businesses to achieve compliance with Section 404, could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to furnish a report by our management assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. The report must also contain a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nIf our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert our internal control over financial reporting is effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective presently or in the future (or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective), we could incur additional costs and expenses to resolve these deficiencies and lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2014, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation (our \u201ccertificate of incorporation\u201d) and amended and restated by-laws (our \u201cby-laws\u201d) contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na board of directors that, until the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, will be divided into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how our stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; and\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our by-laws.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nThe issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of common stock.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our holders of common stock. Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or if we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our common stock or the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have not historically paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain our earnings, if any, to use in our ongoing operations. In addition, the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, our board of directors has the authority to issue one or more series of preferred stock without action of the stockholders. Although we have no present plan to issue any additional series of preferred stock, the issuance of any additional series could also have the effect of limiting dividends on the common stock.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nStatements set forth in this Form 10-K or statements incorporated by reference from documents we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission may contain forward-looking statements.
