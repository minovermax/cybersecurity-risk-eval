{"cik": "776867", "company": "WHITE MOUNTAINS INSURANCE GROUP LTD", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe information contained in this report may contain \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. See \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d on page 97 for specific important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. The Company\u2019s actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties discussed below.\nRisks Related to White Mountains Generally\nIf we are required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total goodwill and other intangible assets of $1,066 million on our consolidated balance sheet, most of which relates to our acquisitions of Ark and NSM and NSM\u2019s subsequent acquisitions of KBK, Embrace, the Renewal Rights from AIG, Kingsbridge and J.C. Taylor. As of December 31, 2021, goodwill and other intangible assets related to Ark and NSM were $1,018 million.\nWe periodically review goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether an impairment has occurred. An impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The evaluation of goodwill or other intangible assets for impairment requires the use of significant judgment in determining fair value, including assumptions about the future performance of the associated business. We may experience unexpected circumstances that cause future results to differ significantly from those assumptions used in our estimation of the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets that could cause us to conclude that goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired. Such an impairment would result in a non-cash charge to income that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Adverse changes in equity markets, interest rates, debt markets or foreign currency exchange rates could result in significant losses to the value of our investment portfolio.\nOur investment portfolio primarily consists of fixed maturity investments, short-term investments, common equity securities, our investment in MediaAlpha and other long-term investments. We invest to maximize long-term after-tax total returns while taking prudent levels of risk and maintaining a diversified portfolio subject to our investment guidelines and various regulatory restrictions. However, investing entails substantial risks. We may not achieve our investment objectives, and our investment performance may vary substantially over time. Losses or volatility in the equity or fixed income markets could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe fair market value of our investment portfolio is affected by general economic and market conditions that are outside of our control, including (i) fluctuations in equity market levels, interest rates, debt market levels and foreign currency exchange rates, (ii) public health crises, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other outside events, and (iii) credit losses sustained by issuers. A significant decline in the equity markets such as that experienced from September 2008 to March 2009 could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition to causing declines in the value of securities that we own in our investment portfolio, public health crises, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other outside events can adversely affect general commercial activity and the economies of many countries, which could materially adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the entities in which we have invested. For example, reductions of travel, including due to travel restrictions and bans imposed by governments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively impact revenues at PassportCard/DavidShield. We are also exposed to changes in debt markets. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. In particular, a significant increase in interest rates could result in significant losses in the value of our investment portfolio and, consequently, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We also hold investments, such as unconsolidated entities, including Kudu\u2019s Participation Contracts, a bank loan fund, private equity funds, hedge funds, Lloyd\u2019s trust deposits, ILS funds and private debt instruments that are not regularly traded in active investment markets and may be illiquid. These investments can experience volatility in their returns or valuation, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to greater volatility from our investment in MediaAlpha, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOn October 30, 2020, MediaAlpha completed the MediaAlpha IPO. Following the MediaAlpha IPO, White Mountains\u2019s investment in MediaAlpha is valued based on the publicly-traded share price of MediaAlpha\u2019s common stock, which at the December 31, 2021 closing price of $15.44 per share was $262 million. As a result, White Mountains\u2019s reported book value per share and adjusted book value per share may be subject to greater volatility in the future, as the valuation of its investment in MediaAlpha based on the publicly-traded share price of MediaAlpha\u2019s common stock could be more volatile than the valuation of its investment in MediaAlpha based on the private discounted cash flow model used in White Mountains\u2019s financial statements in periods prior to the MediaAlpha IPO. Should there be a significant decrease in the publicly-traded share price of MediaAlpha\u2019s common stock, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have successfully created shareholder value through acquisitions and dispositions. We may not be able to continue to create shareholder value through such transactions in the future, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn past years, we have completed numerous acquisitions and dispositions, many of which have contributed significantly to creating shareholder value. Failure to identify and complete future acquisitions and dispositions could limit our ability to create shareholder value. Even if we were to identify and complete future acquisitions and dispositions, there is no assurance that such transactions will ultimately achieve their anticipated benefits, and such transactions could materially adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nOur investment portfolio includes securities that do not have readily observable market prices. We use valuation methodologies that are inherently subjective and uncertain to value these securities. The values of securities established using these methodologies may never be realized, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, White Mountains owned $891 million in securities, including our investments in Kudu\u2019s Participation Contracts and PassportCard/DavidShield, that are not actively traded in public markets, do not have readily observable market prices, and are classified as Level 3 investments in the GAAP fair value hierarchy. On a quarterly basis, we make a good faith determination of the fair value of our Level 3 investments in our GAAP financial statements using valuation techniques that are inherently subjective and uncertain.\nIn determining the GAAP fair value of these securities, we use judgment in selecting the fair value methodology and the significant inputs that are employed by that methodology for each such investment. See \u201cLevel 3 Measurements\u201d under \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES - Fair Value Measurements\u201d on pages 76 - 78 for a description of the methodologies we use to determine GAAP fair value of our investments without a readily observable market price. Given the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in the methodologies we use to determine the fair value of our investments without a readily observable market price, the values of such investments established using these methodologies may never be realized, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to HG Global/BAM\u2019s Business and Industry\nBAM may not maintain a favorable financial strength rating, which could materially adversely affect its ability to conduct business and, consequently, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThird-party rating agencies assess and rate the financial strength of insurers, including claims-paying ability. These ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies and are subject to revision at any time at the sole discretion of the rating agencies. Some of the criteria relate to general economic conditions and other circumstances outside the rated insurer\u2019s control. The financial strength rating of Standard & Poor\u2019s is used by outside parties to assess the suitability of BAM as a business counterparty and is an important factor in establishing BAM\u2019s competitive position.\nStandard & Poor\u2019s periodically evaluates BAM to confirm that it continues to meet the criteria of the rating previously assigned to it. On June 6, 2017, Standard & Poor\u2019s placed BAM on credit watch negative and initiated a detailed review of BAM\u2019s financial strength rating. On June 26, 2017, Standard & Poor\u2019s concluded its review and affirmed BAM\u2019s \u201cAA/stable\u201d financial strength rating. During the time that BAM\u2019s financial strength rating was placed on credit watch negative by Standard & Poor\u2019s, it voluntarily withdrew from the marketplace and did not write any municipal bond insurance policies.\nThe maintenance of an \u201cAA\u201d or better financial strength rating from Standard & Poor\u2019s is particularly important to BAM\u2019s ability to write municipal bond insurance policies and meet its debt service obligations under the BAM Surplus Notes. On July 28, 2021, Standard & Poor\u2019s concluded its most recent review and affirmed BAM\u2019s \u201cAA/stable\u201d financial strength rating. See \u201cRATINGS\u201d on page 25. A downgrade, withdrawal or negative watch/outlook of BAM\u2019s financial strength rating could severely limit or prevent BAM\u2019s ability to write municipal bond insurance policies, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf BAM does not pay some or all of the principal and interest due on the BAM Surplus Notes, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, White Mountains owned $365 million in BAM Surplus Notes and had accrued $158 million of interest thereon. No payment of principal or interest on the BAM Surplus Notes may be made without the approval of the NYDFS. Under its agreements with HG Global, BAM is required to seek regulatory approval to pay principal and interest on the BAM Surplus Notes only to the extent that its capital resources continue to support its outstanding obligations, business plan and rating. It is unlikely that BAM would pay principal and interest on the BAM Surplus Notes if such payments could lead to a rating downgrade. In December 2021, the NYDFS approved a $34 million cash payment of principal and interest on the BAM Surplus Notes. We cannot guarantee that the NYDFS will approve payments on the BAM Surplus Notes in the future.\nIf BAM does not repay some or all of the principal and interest on the BAM Surplus Notes, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. BAM\u2019s ability to repay principal and interest on the BAM Surplus Notes is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are beyond BAM\u2019s control, including primary municipal bond issuance levels, insured penetration rates, interest rate levels, credit spreads, trading value, capture rate and market share. BAM also could incur significant losses from the municipal bonds it insures. In addition, the municipal bond insurance industry is highly competitive. BAM\u2019s primary competitor is Assured. BAM and Assured each seeks to differentiate itself through financial strength ratings, claims paying resources and underwriting strategies. If BAM is unable to compete effectively against Assured, it could result in fewer policies issued, lower premium levels and less favorable policy terms and conditions.\nWe are exposed to losses from municipal bond insurance written by BAM through our reinsurance arrangements between BAM and HG Re, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur reinsurance subsidiary, HG Re, reinsures (i) losses up to the first 15%-of-par outstanding on each municipal bond insured by BAM and (ii) certain municipal bonds insured by BAM on an excess of loss basis. Should the policies underwritten by BAM experience insured losses for any reason, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting the finances of municipalities to varying degrees, and, over time, financial stress could emerge. BAM views consumption-based tax-backed credits (sales, hotel, excise), transportation-related credits (airports, mass transportation, ports and toll roads) and higher education-related credits as those most likely to be affected by pandemic-related impacts on the economy. Combined, these sectors total approximately 16% of BAM\u2019s outstanding insured par.\nRisks Related to Ark\u2019s Business and Industry\nUnpredictable catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nArk writes insurance and reinsurance policies that cover unpredictable catastrophic events. Ark has exposure to losses caused by unpredictable catastrophic events including natural and other disasters such as hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, floods, wildfires, tornadoes, tsunamis, and severe winter weather all over the world. Catastrophes can also include large losses driven by public health crises, terrorist attacks, explosions, infrastructure failures, and cyber-attacks.\nThe extent of a catastrophe loss is a function of both the severity of the event and total amount of insured exposure to the event as well as the coverage provided to customers. Increases in the value and concentration of insured property or insured employees, the effects of inflation, changes in weather patterns and increased terrorism could increase the future frequency and/or severity of claims from catastrophic events. Climate change contributes to higher temperatures, sea level rise and more extreme weather events including droughts, heavy storms, wildfires, and stronger hurricanes, which increases the frequency and severity of major natural catastrophes. There is also a growing threat of cyber catastrophes due to the increasing interconnectivity of global systems. Claims from catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Ark\u2019s ability to write new insurance and reinsurance policies could also be impacted as a result of corresponding reductions in its capital levels.\nArk seeks to manage its exposure to catastrophic losses by limiting and monitoring the aggregate insured value of policies in geographic areas with exposure to catastrophic events and by buying reinsurance. To manage, monitor and analyze insured values and potential losses, Ark utilizes proprietary and third-party catastrophe management software to estimate potential losses for many different catastrophe scenarios. Ark incorporates the physical risk of climate change in its underwriting process through sensitivity and stress testing of its catastrophe models, including increased frequency of U.S. windstorms and the implications of storm surge. Ark\u2019s estimates of potential losses are dependent on many variables, including assumptions about storm intensity, storm surge, and loss amplification, loss adjustment expenses and insurance-to-value in the aftermath of weather-related catastrophes. In addition, Ark has to account for quality of data provided by insureds. Accordingly, if the assumptions are incorrect, the losses Ark might incur from an actual catastrophe could be materially different than the expectation of losses generated from modeled catastrophe scenarios, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nArk and its subsidiaries benefit from favorable financial strength ratings from A.M. Best and Standard & Poor\u2019s, the deterioration of which could materially adversely affect its ability to conduct business and, consequently, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThird-party rating agencies assess and rate the financial strength, including claims-paying ability, of insurers, reinsurers and the Lloyd\u2019s marketplace. These ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies and are subject to revision at any time at the sole discretion of the agencies. Some of the criteria relate to general economic conditions and other circumstances outside the rated company\u2019s control. These financial strength ratings are used by policyholders, agents and brokers to assess the suitability of insurers and reinsurers as business counterparties and are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. Rating agencies periodically evaluate us to confirm that we continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to us.\nThe maintenance of \u201cA-\u201d or better financial strength ratings is particularly important to Ark\u2019s ability to write new or renewal property and casualty insurance and reinsurance business in most markets. Ark writes insurance and reinsurance through Lloyd\u2019s Syndicates 4020 and 3902, each of which benefits from the financial strength rating of \u201cA/stable\u201d by A.M. Best and \u201cA+/stable\u201d by Standard & Poor\u2019s assigned to the Lloyd\u2019s marketplace. Beginning in January 2021, Ark began writing certain classes of its business through GAIL, Ark\u2019s wholly-owned Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance company, which has been assigned an \u201cA/stable\u201d financial strength rating by A.M. Best. See \u201cRATINGS\u201d on page 25.\nA downgrade, withdrawal or negative watch/outlook of these financial strength ratings could severely limit or prevent Ark from writing new policies or renewing existing policies, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A downgrade, withdrawal or negative watch/outlook of these financial strength ratings also could limit our ability to raise new debt or could make new and certain existing debt more costly and/or have more restrictive conditions.\nArk may not successfully alleviate risk through reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nArk attempts to limit its risk of loss through reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements. Retrocessional arrangements refer to reinsurance purchased by a reinsurer to cover its own risks assumed from ceding companies. The availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions, which are outside of our control. In addition, the coverage provided by Ark\u2019s reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements may be inadequate to cover its future liabilities. As a result, Ark may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through these arrangements, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nPurchasing reinsurance does not relieve Ark of its underlying obligations to policyholders or ceding companies, so any inability to collect amounts due from reinsurers could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Inability to collect amounts due from reinsurers can result from a number of scenarios, including: (1) reinsurers choosing to withhold payment due to a dispute or other factors beyond our control; and (2) reinsurers becoming unable to pay amounts owed to us as a result of a deterioration in their financial condition. While we currently believe the condition of Ark\u2019s reinsurers is strong, it is possible that one or more of Ark\u2019s reinsurers will be adversely affected by future significant losses or economic events, causing them to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed.\nIn addition, due to factors such as the price or availability of reinsurance or retrocessional coverage, we sometimes decide to increase the amount of risk we retain by purchasing less reinsurance. Such determinations have the effect of increasing our financial exposure to losses associated with such risks and, in the event of significant losses associated with a given risk, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries are highly competitive and cyclical and we may not be able to compete effectively in the future, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries are highly competitive and have historically been cyclical, experiencing periods of severe price competition and less selective underwriting standards (soft markets) followed by periods of relatively high prices and more selective underwriting standards (hard markets). Ark competes with other Lloyd\u2019s syndicates, the London companies market participants and major U.S., Bermuda and European and other international insurance and reinsurance companies. Many of these competitors have greater resources than Ark does, have established long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the insurance and reinsurance industries and may have higher financial strength ratings, which can be a significant competitive advantage for them.\nSoft primary insurance market conditions could lead to a significant reduction in reinsurance premium rates, less favorable contract terms and fewer submissions for Ark\u2019s reinsurance underwriting capacity. The supply of reinsurance is also related to the level of reinsured losses and the level of industry capital which, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return earned in the reinsurance industry. As a result, the reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted improvements in reinsurance rate levels and terms and conditions. In addition, in recent years the persistent low interest rate environment and ease of entry into the reinsurance sector has led to increased competition from third-party capital in the property catastrophe excess reinsurance line. This alternative capital provides collateralized property catastrophe protection in the form of catastrophe bonds, industry loss warranties, sidecars and other vehicles that facilitate the ability for non-reinsurance entities, such as hedge funds and pension funds, to compete for property catastrophe excess reinsurance business outside of the traditional treaty market.\nWe expect to continue to experience the effects of the insurance and reinsurance industries\u2019 cyclicality. If Ark is unable to maintain its competitive position throughout soft and hard market cycles, its business may be adversely affected and we may not be able to compete effectively in the future, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nArk\u2019s loss and LAE reserves may be inadequate to cover the ultimate liability for losses, and as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nArk must maintain reserves adequate to cover the estimated ultimate liabilities for loss and LAE. Loss and LAE reserves are typically comprised of (1) case reserves for reported claims and (2) incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) reserves for losses that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported and for expected future development on case reserves. Loss and LAE reserves are estimates of what Ark believes the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known to Ark. These estimates involve actuarial and claims assessments, and require Ark to make a number of assumptions about future events that are subject to unexpected changes and are beyond Ark\u2019s control, such as future trends in claim severity, emerging coverage issues, frequency, inflation, legislative and judicial changes and other factors. Because of uncertainties associated with estimating ultimate loss and LAE reserves, we cannot be certain that Ark\u2019s reserves are adequate. In the event that Ark\u2019s reserves become insufficient to cover the actual losses and LAE, Ark may need to add to the reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For further discussion of our loss and LAE reserves, see \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES - Loss and LAE Reserves\u201d on page 79.\nRisks Related to NSM\u2019s Business and Industry\nOur commission revenues are dependent on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the pricing and profitability of certain segments of the property and casualty insurance industry, which is highly competitive and cyclical.\nNSM generates most of its revenues from commissions that are a portion of premiums charged by insurance companies to their insureds. NSM also generates profit commissions from certain of its businesses that are paid by insurance companies based on the profitability of policies placed with them. NSM is an MGA and program administrator with delegated binding authorities, and as such, its carrier partners bear the insurance risk on the programs designed and underwritten by NSM. Should NSM fail to meet the profitability expectations of the carriers that write the business it places, those carriers could choose to stop writing the business, which could materially adversely affect NSM\u2019s commission revenues and, consequently, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive and has historically been cyclical, experiencing periods of severe price competition and less selective underwriting standards (soft markets) followed by periods of relatively high prices and more selective underwriting standards (hard markets). The cyclicality of the property and casualty markets is beyond our control and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition by reducing the commissions we receive for property and casualty insurance we place during soft markets. We expect to continue to experience the effects of cyclicality and may not be able to successfully manage the associated risks.\nOur future commission revenues could also be materially adversely affected by other factors beyond our control, including (i) the increasing availability of capital markets-based products designed to replace traditional insurance and reinsurance products; (ii) growth in the direct-to-consumer sales channel at the expense of insurance intermediaries including agents; and (iii) the percentage of premium insurance carriers will pay for placement services.\nA substantial portion of NSM\u2019s business is placed with one insurance carrier, and most of NSM\u2019s business is placed with a small number of carriers.\nNSM placed approximately 25% of its business with its single largest carrier during the year ended December 31, 2021. NSM placed approximately 65% of its business with its five largest carriers during the year ended December 31, 2021. Should any of these carriers reduce the volume of business accepted from NSM or adversely change the terms and conditions of placement, we cannot guarantee that NSM would be able to find other carriers to assume the business, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Kudu\u2019s Business and Industry\nKudu\u2019s financial performance is dependent upon its clients\u2019 asset and performance-based fees, which are subject to a variety of economic, market and other risks.\nThrough our subsidiary Kudu, we provide capital solutions for asset management firms through non-controlling equity interests in the form of revenue and earnings participation contracts. Kudu\u2019s clients generate their revenues and earnings by charging asset based fees, which are typically a percentage of the value of the assets they manage for their clients, and/or performance based fees, which are typically a portion of actual returns achieved for their clients above a target return. The revenue that Kudu generates from its clients is subject to the same general economic and market risks that may affect our investment portfolio. See \u201cOur investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Adverse changes in equity markets, interest rates, debt markets or foreign currency exchange rates could result in significant losses to the value of our investment portfolio.\u201d on page 26.\nAdditionally, Kudu\u2019s clients participate in a highly competitive, highly regulated industry that subjects their operations to a number of other risks that are out of our control and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including (i) changes in investor preference from the actively-managed investments offered by Kudu\u2019s clients to passively-managed investments; (ii) the ability of Kudu\u2019s clients to successfully attract new clients and retain existing ones; (iii) the ability of Kudu\u2019s clients to avoid fee compression; (iv) the reliance of Kudu\u2019s clients on a small number of key personnel; and (v) future changes to regulations that make Kudu\u2019s clients\u2019 businesses more cumbersome and expensive to operate.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nWe may be treated as a PFIC, in which case a U.S. holder of our common shares could be subject to disadvantageous rules under U.S. federal income tax laws.\nSignificant potential adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences apply to any U.S. person who owns shares in a passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d). In general, a non-U.S. corporation is classified as a PFIC for a taxable year in which, after taking into account the income and assets of the corporation and certain subsidiaries pursuant to certain \u201clook-through\u201d rules, either (i) 75% or more of its gross income is passive income or (ii) 50% or more of the average quarterly value of its gross assets is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income. If a corporation is treated as a PFIC for a taxable year, it is generally treated as a PFIC for all later taxable years. Passive income for PFIC purposes generally includes interest, dividends and other investment income, subject to certain exceptions.\nOn January 15, 2021 new final and proposed PFIC regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury were published in the Federal Register. The final regulations are generally effective for tax years of shareholders beginning on or after their date of publication. The proposed regulations may be selectively adopted by shareholders prior to their finalization. We are carefully studying the final and proposed regulations, including their effective dates and their application to White Mountains to determine their effects on our PFIC status in the future.\nWhile we believe that White Mountains should not currently be treated as a PFIC based upon the income and assets of White Mountains and the income and assets of its subsidiaries (taking into account certain applicable subsidiary \u201clook-through\u201d rules), there is no assurance that White Mountains will not become a PFIC in the future as a result of changes in law or regulations (or their application to White Mountains) or changes in our assets, income or business operations. Nor is there assurance that the Internal Revenue Service will not successfully argue that White Mountains is now, or in the future may become, a PFIC.\nIf we are determined to be a PFIC, a U.S. person may be subject to less advantageous tax consequences upon the sale, exchange or receipt of dividends with respect to our common shares and may be required to pay U.S. federal income tax at ordinary income rates for gains and dividends, as well as an interest charge on certain \u201cexcess distributions.\u201d Certain elections designed to mitigate the adverse consequences of owning shares in a PFIC, including a \u201cProtective QEF Election,\u201d may be available. If you are a U.S. person, we encourage you to consult your own tax advisor concerning the potential tax consequences to you under the PFIC rules.\nThe Company and certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries may become subject to U.S. tax, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company and our non-U.S. subsidiaries without U.S. branches operate in a manner such that none of these companies should be subject to U.S. tax (other than U.S. excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring U.S. risks and U.S. withholding tax on some types of U.S. source investment income) because none of these companies should be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States. However, because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the United States, we cannot be certain that the Internal Revenue Service will not contend successfully that the Company or its non-U.S. subsidiaries without U.S. branches are engaged in a trade or business in the United States. If the Company or any of its non-U.S. subsidiaries without U.S. branches were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States, such entity could be subject to U.S. corporate income and branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such U.S. business, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws or tax treaties could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe income of our U.S. subsidiaries is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax and other taxes. The income of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is generally subject to a lower tax rate than that imposed by the United States. Certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are eligible for the benefits of tax treaties between the United States and other countries. We believe our non-U.S. subsidiaries will continue to be eligible for treaty benefits. However, it is possible that factual changes or changes to U.S. tax laws or changes to tax treaties that presently apply to our non-U.S. subsidiaries could increase income subject to tax, or the tax rate on income, in the United States. Similarly, changes to the applicable tax laws, treaties or regulations of other countries could subject the income of members of our group to higher rates of tax outside the United States. Additionally, the base erosion and profit shifting project currently being undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) and the European Commission\u2019s investigation into illegal state aid may result in changes to long standing tax principles, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur non-U.S. subsidiaries are treated as CFCs and may subject a U.S. 10% shareholder of our common shares to disadvantageous rules under U.S. federal income tax laws.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTCJA\u201d) modified certain U.S. tax rules that apply to controlled foreign corporations (\u201cCFCs\u201d). As a result of these changes, each of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is treated as a CFC. If any of our shareholders is a \u201cU.S. 10% shareholder\u201d (as described below) that directly or indirectly owns stock in White Mountains, that shareholder must include in its taxable income each year its pro rata share of our CFC subsidiaries\u2019 \u201csubpart F income\u201d for that year, even if no distributions are received by the U.S. 10% shareholder.\nDue to changes made by the TCJA, a shareholder is treated as a U.S. 10% shareholder if the shareholder is a U.S. person who owns directly, indirectly or through constructive ownership rules 10% or more of either the voting power or the total value of our shares. As a result, a U.S. person that owns (directly, indirectly or through constructive ownership rules) 10% or more of our shares will generally be treated as a U.S. 10% shareholder of our CFC subsidiaries, notwithstanding the voting power restrictions of our shares. However, a person that is a U.S. 10% shareholder solely as a result of constructive ownership rules (i.e., such person does not directly or indirectly own stock of White Mountains) should not have a subpart F income inclusion with respect to our CFC subsidiaries.\nIf you are a U.S. person who might be a U.S. 10% shareholder, we encourage you to consult your own tax advisor concerning the CFC rules.\nProposed regulations could subject U.S. persons who are shareholders to disadvantageous rules under U.S. federal income tax laws pertaining to \u201crelated person insurance income\u201d\nProposed regulations issued on January 24, 2022, address the subpart F \u201crelated person insurance income\u201d (\u201cRPII\u201d) tax regime. The proposed regulations would expand the scope of relationships giving rise to RPII by treating intra-group reinsurance transactions as generating RPII if a non-U.S. parent entity of the group is majority owned by U.S. persons. If the proposed regulations are finalized as written, U.S. shareholders of the Company could be required to include in their taxable income a proportionate share of White Mountains\u2019s RPII income annually as subpart F income, even if no distributions are received by the U.S. shareholder.\nThe proposed regulations generally would apply to tax years of corporations beginning on or after the date finalized regulations are published in the Federal Register, and to tax years of U.S. persons in which or with which those corporations' tax years end. We encourage shareholders who are U.S. persons to consult their own tax advisors concerning the proposed regulations.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulation\nRegulation may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to supervision and regulation by regulatory authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including state, national and international insurance regulators. Regulatory authorities have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers relating to, among other things, data protection and data privacy, solvency standards, licensing, coverage requirements, policy rates and forms and the form and content of financial reports. Regulatory authorities continue to implement new or enhanced regulatory requirements. Regulatory authorities also may seek to exercise their supervisory or enforcement authority in new or more extensive ways. These actions, if they occur, could affect the competitive market and the way we conduct our business and manage our capital and could result in lower revenues and higher costs. As a result, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nBermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to shareholders.\nWe are organized under the laws of Bermuda, and a portion of our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for our shareholders to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in Bermuda or in countries other than the United States where we will have assets. In addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of Bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by the Bermuda Companies Act. The Companies Act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including the provisions relating to interested directors, amalgamations, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors. Generally, the duties of directors and officers of a Bermuda company are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Bermuda companies generally do not have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances. Class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under Bermuda law. The Bermuda courts, however, would ordinarily be expected to permit a shareholder to commence an action in the name of a company to remedy a wrong to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of the company or illegal, or would result in the violation of the company\u2019s memorandum of association or bye-laws. Furthermore, a Bermuda court would ordinarily be expected to permit a shareholder to commence an action that alleges a fraud against non-controlling shareholders or, for instance, where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of the company\u2019s shareholders than that which actually approved it.\nWhen the affairs of a company are being conducted in a manner that is oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of some part of the shareholders, one or more shareholders may apply to the Supreme Court of Bermuda, which may make such order as it sees fit, including an order regulating the conduct of the company\u2019s affairs in the future or ordering the purchase of the shares of any shareholders by other shareholders or by the company. Additionally, under our bye-laws and as permitted by Bermuda law, each shareholder has waived any claim or right of action against our directors or officers for any action taken by directors or officers in the performance of their duties, except for actions involving fraud or dishonesty. In addition, the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Bermuda law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the United States, particularly the State of Delaware. Therefore, our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction within the United States.\nWe could be materially adversely affected if our controls designed to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies, and legal and regulatory standards are not effective.\nOur business is highly dependent on our ability to successfully execute a large number of transactions, many of which are complex. These processes are often subject to internal guidelines and policies, and government regulation. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. If controls are not effective, it could lead to unanticipated risk exposure, or damage to our reputation and, consequently, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOther Risks Related to Our Businesses\nWe may be unable to adequately maintain our systems and safeguard the security of our data, which could adversely impact our ability to operate our business and cause reputational harm and, consequently, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause our business and operations rely on secure and efficient information technology systems, we depend on our ability, and the ability of certain third parties, including vendors and business partners, to access our computer systems to perform necessary functions such as providing quotes and product pricing, billing and processing transactions, administering claims, and reporting our financial results. The functioning of these systems may be impacted by any number of events, including power outages, natural and manmade catastrophes, and cyber-attacks. In the event we are unable to access any of our systems, or any third-party system that we rely upon, our ability to operate our business effectively may be significantly impaired.\nOur business also depends upon our ability to securely process, store, transmit and safeguard confidential and proprietary information that is in our possession. This information includes confidential information relating to our business, and personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) and protected health information (\u201cPHI\u201d) belonging to our employees, customers, claimants and business partners. Because our systems may be vulnerable to a variety of forms of unauthorized access that could result in a data breach, including hackers, computer viruses, and other cyber-attacks, as well as breaches that result from dishonest employees, errors by employees or lost or stolen computer devices, we may not be able to protect the confidentiality of such information.\nThird parties present an additional risk of cyber-related events. We outsource certain technological and business process functions to third-party providers. We rely on these third parties to maintain and store PII and PHI and other confidential information on their systems. We also routinely transmit such information by e-mail and other electronic means. Although we attempt to establish sufficient controls and secure capabilities to transmit such information and to prevent unauthorized disclosure, these controls may not be sufficient. Furthermore, third-party providers may not have appropriate controls in place to protect such information.\nOur computer systems have been and will continue to be the target of cyber-attacks, although we are not aware that we have experienced a material cybersecurity breach. We are also not aware of any third-party vendor having experienced a material cybersecurity breach that impacted our data. The risk of a cyber-attack may increase, and we may experience more significant attacks in the future.\nThe risks identified above could expose us to data breaches, disruptions of service, financial losses and significant increases in compliance costs and reputational harm. In addition, a data breach could subject us to legal liability or regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and regulations enacted by federal, state and foreign governments, or other regulatory bodies. As a result, our ability to conduct our business and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may suffer losses from unfavorable outcomes from litigation and other legal proceedings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time we are subject to legal proceedings. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more legal matters, our ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts we have reserved and such additional amounts could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, it is possible that these legal proceedings could result in equitable remedies or other unexpected outcomes that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively and they may be difficult to replace, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMuch of our competitive advantage is based on the expertise, experience and know-how of our key personnel. We do not have fixed term employment agreements with any of our key personnel or key man life insurance and the loss of one or more of these key personnel could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our success also depends on the ability to hire and retain additional personnel. Difficulty in hiring or retaining personnel could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 68419, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "WTM"}
