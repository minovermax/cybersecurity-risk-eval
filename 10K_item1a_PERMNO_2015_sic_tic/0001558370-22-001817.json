RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information included in this Form 10-K. The occurrence of any of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. In these circumstances, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could have in the future, certain negative impacts on our business, and such impacts may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken by governments, businesses, including us and our vendors, and the public at large to limit COVID-19's spread have had, and could again have in the future, certain negative impacts on our business including, without limitation, the following:\n\u25cf We have faced, and may continue to face, delays in the delivery of certain products from our vendors as a result of shipping delays due to, among other things, additional safety requirements imposed by governmental authorities and capacity constraints experienced by our transportation contractors.\n\u25cf Some of our vendors have experienced, and may experience in the future, temporary facility closures, production slowdowns and disruption to operations as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their respective businesses, such as Thor Industries, Inc.\u2019s temporary closure of its North American production facilities from late March to early May 2020.\n\u25cf Disruptions in supply chains may place constraints on our ability to source products, which may increase our product costs or lead to shortages. For instance, disruptions in the supply of adhesives may negatively impact our procurement of fiberglass travel trailers.\n\u25cf When governmentally mandated or voluntary stay-at-home guidelines have been put in place, we have experienced a decrease in traffic at our retail locations, which resulted in a decrease in the sales of certain of our products and services at our retail locations. If stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders are reinstated, we may again experience negative impacts on our sales that could be more prolonged and more severe than what we have experienced to date.\n\u25cf National parks and RV parks temporarily closed and may in the future close again in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could cause consumers to use their RVs less frequently and be less inclined to need or renew certain of our services or purchase products through our e-commerce websites.\n\u25cf As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had temporarily closed one and two locations, respectively, as a result of COVID-19 and branding changes. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic intensifies or governmental orders change, we may be forced to temporarily close more locations in the future.\n\u25cf Deteriorating economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased unemployment, financial market uncertainty, increased inflation or decreases in disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions, could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services or impact our borrowing costs.\n\u25cf We have made temporary changes to our operating procedures at our retail locations and offices. We have taken measures to protect our customers, employees and facilities, which include, but are not limited to, social distancing, providing employees with face coverings and/or other protective clothing as required, and implementing additional cleaning and sanitization routines. These measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employees and, therefore, we may face labor shortages including key positions. Additionally, our employees may not be as efficient while operating under such procedures, which could result in additional labor costs.\n\u25cf The financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may cause one or more of our counterparty financial institutions to fail or default on their obligations to us, which could cause us to incur significant losses.\n\u25cf Deteriorations in our financial results and financial condition as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause us to default on one or multiple of our credit agreements, including any of the subjective acceleration clauses in such agreements. If this occurs, our obligations under the relevant agreement may be accelerated which would have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity position and financial position.\n\u25cf We may be required to record significant impairment charges with respect to noncurrent assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets, and other long-lived assets whose fair values may be negatively affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations. Also, we may be required to write off excess or obsolete inventory as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s damaging impacts on our business.\n\u25cf As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental guidance or directives, we have required, at times, most office-based employees to work remotely. We may experience reductions in productivity and disruptions to our business routines and heightened cybersecurity risks while our remote work policy remains in place.\nThe resumption of normal business operations after the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may be delayed or constrained by its lingering effects on our consumers, vendors or third-party service providers.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not successfully execute or achieve the expected benefits of our 2019 Strategic Shift and this program may result in further asset impairment charges and adversely affect the Company's business.\nIn the third fiscal quarter of 2019, we announced the 2019 Strategic Shift. Implementation of the program may be costly and disruptive to our business. We may not be able to realize the benefits initially anticipated and the expected costs may be greater than expected. A variety of factors could cause the Company not to realize some or all of the expected benefits or incur greater costs, including, among others, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to the 2019 Strategic Shift, unexpected costs associated with executing the 2019 Strategic Shift, or the Company's ability to achieve the benefits contemplated by the program. Further, any cost savings that the Company realizes may be offset, in whole or in part, by a reduction in revenues or through increases in other expenses. In addition, the Company may need to incur further impairment charges to its long-lived assets, including its operating lease assets, as a result of the 2019 Strategic Shift.\nOur business is affected by the availability of financing to us and our customers.\nOur business is affected by the availability of financing to us and our customers. Generally, RV dealers, including us, finance their purchases of inventory with financing provided by lending institutions. As of December 31, 2021, we had up to $1.7 billion in maximum borrowing capacity under our Eighth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement for floor plan financing (see Note 4 \u2500 Inventories and Floor Plan Payables to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). A decrease in the availability of\nthis type of wholesale financing or an increase in the cost of such wholesale financing could prevent us from carrying adequate levels of inventory, which may limit product offerings and could lead to reduced sales and revenues.\nFurthermore, many of our customers finance their RV purchases. Consumer credit market conditions continue to influence demand, especially for RVs, and may continue to do so. There continue to be fewer lenders, more stringent underwriting and loan approval criteria, and greater down payment requirements than in the past. If credit conditions or the credit worthiness of our customers worsen, and adversely affect the ability of consumers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in the sales of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuel shortages, or high prices for fuel, could have a negative effect on our business.\nGasoline or diesel fuel is required for the operation of RVs. There can be no assurance that the supply of these petroleum products will continue uninterrupted, that rationing will not be imposed or that the price of or tax on these petroleum products will not significantly increase in the future. Shortages of gasoline and diesel fuel have had a material adverse effect on the RV industry as a whole in the past and any such shortages or substantial increases in the price of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the well-being, as well as the continued popularity and reputation for quality, of our manufacturers, particularly Thor Industries, Inc. and Forest River, Inc.\nThor Industries, Inc. and Forest River, Inc. supplied approximately 72.4% and 24.1%, respectively, of our new RV inventory as of December 31, 2021. We depend on our manufacturers to provide us with products that compare favorably with competing products in terms of quality, performance, safety and advanced features. Any adverse change in the production efficiency, product development efforts, technological advancement, marketplace acceptance, reputation, marketing capabilities or financial condition of our manufacturers, particularly Thor Industries, Inc. and Forest River, Inc., could have a substantial adverse impact on our business. Any difficulties encountered by any of these manufacturers, resulting from economic, financial, or other factors, could adversely affect the quality and amount of products that they are able to supply to us, and the services and support they provide to us.\nThe interruption or discontinuance of the operations of Thor Industries, Inc. and Forest River, Inc. or other manufacturers could cause us to experience shortfalls, disruptions, or delays with respect to needed inventory. Although we believe that adequate alternate sources would be available that could replace any manufacturer as a product source, those alternate sources may not be available at the time of any interruption, and alternative products may not be available at comparable quality and prices.\nOur supply arrangements with manufacturers are typically governed by dealer agreements, which are customary in the RV industry. Our dealer agreements with manufacturers are generally made on a location-by-location basis, and each retail location typically enters into multiple dealer agreements with multiple manufacturers. These dealer agreements may contain affirmative obligations that we must comply with. Our dealer agreements also generally provide for a one-year term, which is typically renewed annually. For more information on our dealer arrangements, see \u201cItem 1. Business \u2500 Vehicle Sourcing and Dealer Arrangements\u201d under Part I of this Form 10-K.\nIn addition, certain of our dealer agreements contain stocking level requirements and certain of our dealer agreements contain contractual provisions concerning minimum advertised product pricing for current model year units. Wholesale pricing is generally established on a model year basis and is subject to change at the manufacturer\u2019s sole discretion. In certain cases, manufacturers have, and may continue to establish a suggested retail price, below which we cannot advertise that manufacturer\u2019s RVs. Any change, non-renewal, unfavorable renegotiation or termination of these arrangements for any reason could adversely affect product availability and cost and our financial performance.\nOur business model is impacted by general economic conditions in our markets, and ongoing economic and financial uncertainties could cause a decline in consumer spending that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a business that relies on consumer discretionary spending, we have in the past and may in the future be adversely affected if our customers reduce, delay or forego their purchases of our services, protection plans, products and resources as a result of:\n\u25cf job losses, lower income levels or other population and employment trends;\n\u25cf bankruptcies;\n\u25cf higher consumer debt and interest rates;\n\u25cf reduced access to credit;\n\u25cf higher energy and fuel costs;\n\u25cf relative or perceived cost, availability and comfort of RV use versus other modes of travel, such as air travel and rail;\n\u25cf falling home prices;\n\u25cf lower consumer confidence or discretional consumer spending;\n\u25cf higher inflation rates;\n\u25cf uncertainty or changes in tax policies and tax rates;\n\u25cf uncertainty due to national or international security concerns; or\n\u25cf other general economic conditions, including deflation and recessions.\nWe also rely on our retail locations to attract and retain customers and to build our customer database. If we close retail locations, are unable to open or acquire new retail locations due to general economic conditions or otherwise, or experience declines in customer transactions in our existing retail locations due to general economic conditions or otherwise, our ability to maintain and grow our customer database and our Active Customers will be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nDecreases in Active Customers, average spend per customer, or retention and renewal rates for our Good Sam services and plans would negatively affect our financial performance, and a prolonged period of depressed consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business. In prior years, promotional activities and decreased demand for consumer products affected our profitability and margins, and this negative impact could return or worsen in future periods. In addition, adverse economic conditions may result in an increase in our operating expenses due to, among other things, higher costs of labor, energy, equipment and facilities, as well as higher tariffs. Due to fluctuations in the U.S. economy, our sales, operating and financial results for a particular period are difficult to predict, making it difficult to forecast results for future periods. Additionally, we are subject to economic fluctuations in local markets that may not reflect the economic conditions of the U.S. economy. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the success of our recurring Good Sam services and plans depends, in part, on our customers\u2019 use of certain RV websites and/or the purchase of services, protection plans, products and resources through participating merchants, as well as the health of the RV industry generally.\nIn addition, we have faced, and may continue to face, increased competition from other businesses with similar product and service offerings during recent periods. For example, our competitors have listed RVs at or below cost and we have had little visibility into our competitors or manufacturers\u2019 inventories. As a result, we have responded and may need to further respond by establishing pricing, marketing and other programs or by seeking out additional strategic alliances or acquisitions that may be less favorable to us than we could otherwise establish or obtain in more favorable economic environments. Such programs have adversely impacted our gross margin, operating margin and selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, declines in the national economy could cause merchants who participate in our programs to go out of business. It is likely that, should the number of merchants entering bankruptcy rise, the number of uncollectible accounts would also rise. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in consumer preferences for our products or our failure to gauge those preferences could lead to reduced sales and increased cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nWe cannot be certain that historical consumer preferences for RVs in general, and any related products, will remain unchanged. RVs are generally used for recreational purposes, and demand for our products may be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers\u2019 leisure time and by changes in consumer lifestyle, usage pattern, or taste. Similarly, an overall decrease in consumer leisure time may reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products. As described above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced significant acceleration in our in-store traffic and revenue trends in May 2020 continuing into the quarter ended June 30, 2021 and demand in new and used vehicles remained elevated through the remainder of 2021 and into the beginning of 2022. The industry has seen an influx of new first-time participants because RVs allow people to travel in a safe and socially distant manner during the COVID-19 crisis. These trends may not continue in the future. Over the past several years, we have seen a shift in our overall sales mix towards new travel trailer vehicles, which has led to declines in our average selling price of a new vehicle unit. From 2015 to 2021, new vehicle travel trailer units as a percent of total new vehicles increased from 62% to 72% of total new vehicle unit sales and from 2015 to 2020 our average selling price of a new vehicle unit had decreased from $39,853 to $36,277. However, over the past twelve months due to lower industry supply of travel trailers and motorhomes, both average cost and average sales price have increased. Should the supply chain correct itself over the next twelve months, average sales price may again decline and impact our same store revenue.\nCompetition in the market for services, protection plans, products and resources targeting the RV lifestyle or RV enthusiast could reduce our revenues and profitability.\nThe markets for services, protection plans, products and resources targeting RV owners and enthusiasts are highly fragmented and competitive. Major competitive factors that drive the RV, outdoor and active sports markets are price, product and service features, technology, performance, reliability, quality, availability, variety, delivery and customer service. We compete directly or indirectly with the following types of companies:\n\u25cf other RV dealers selling new and used RVs;\n\u25cf major national insurance and warranty companies, providers of roadside assistance and providers of extended vehicle service contracts;\n\u25cf multi-channel retailers and mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, discount stores, department stores and other retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Target and Amazon;\n\u25cf distributors of RV furniture and accessories;\n\u25cf online retailers; and\n\u25cf independent, local specialty stores.\nAdditional competitors may enter the businesses in which we currently operate. Moreover, some of our mass merchandising competitors do not currently compete in many of the product categories we offer, but may choose to offer a broader array of competing products in the future. Some of our competitors may build new stores in or near our existing locations and certain RV and accessory manufacturers may choose to expand their direct to consumer offerings. In addition, an increase in the number of aggregator and price comparison sites for insurance products may negatively impact our sales of these products. If any of our competitors successfully provides a broader, more efficient or attractive combination of services, protection plans, products and resources to our target customers, our business results could be materially adversely affected. Our inability to compete effectively with existing or potential competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur expansion into new, unfamiliar markets, businesses, product lines or categories presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new markets, businesses, product lines or categories. Delays in opening or acquiring new retail locations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the past, we have acquired new retail locations in new markets and new businesses, product lines or product categories. As a result of this and any future expansion, we may have less familiarity with local consumer preferences and less business, product or category knowledge with respect to new businesses, product lines or categories, and could encounter difficulties in attracting customers due to a reduced level of consumer familiarity with our brands or reduced product or category knowledge. Other factors that may impact our ability to open or acquire new retail locations in new markets and to operate them profitably or acquire new businesses, product lines or categories, many of which are beyond our control, include:\n\u25cf our ability to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or new locations, including our ability to gather and assess demographic and marketing data to determine consumer demand for our products in the locations we select or accurately assess profitability;\n\u25cf our ability to negotiate favorable lease agreements;\n\u25cf our ability to secure product lines;\n\u25cf delays in the entitlement process, the availability of construction materials and labor for new retail locations and significant construction delays or cost overruns;\n\u25cf our ability to secure required third-party or governmental permits and approvals;\n\u25cf our ability to hire and train skilled store operating personnel, especially management personnel;\n\u25cf our ability to provide a satisfactory mix of merchandise that is responsive to the needs of our customers living in the geographic areas where new retail locations are built or acquired;\n\u25cf our ability to supply new retail locations with inventory in a timely manner;\n\u25cf our competitors building or leasing retail locations near our retail locations or in locations we have identified as targets; and\n\u25cf regional economic and other factors in the geographic areas where we expand.\nOur expansion into new markets, businesses, products or categories such as a purchase of an RV furniture distributor, may not be supported adequately by our current resources, personnel and systems, and may also create new distribution and merchandising challenges, including additional strain on our distribution centers, an increase in information to be processed by our management information systems and diversion of management attention from existing operations. To the extent that we are not able to meet these additional challenges, our sales could decrease, and our operating expenses could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinally, the size, timing, and integration of any future new retail location openings or acquisitions or the acquisition of new businesses, product lines or categories may cause substantial fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter. Consequently, our results of operations for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full fiscal year. These fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs a result of the above factors, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our retail locations in new markets or acquiring new businesses, product lines or categories on a profitable basis, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays encountered in connection with acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our profitability\nOur ability to continue to grow through the acquisition of additional retail locations will depend upon various factors, including the following:\n\u25cf the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at attractive purchase prices;\n\u25cf the ability to compete effectively for available acquisition opportunities;\n\u25cf the availability of cash on hand, borrowed funds or Class A common stock with a sufficient market price to finance the acquisitions;\n\u25cf the ability to obtain any requisite third-party or governmental approvals; and\n\u25cf the absence of one or more third parties attempting to impose unsatisfactory restrictions on us in connection with their approval of acquisitions.\nAs a part of our strategy, we occasionally engage in discussions with various dealerships and other outdoor lifestyle businesses regarding their potential acquisition by us. In connection with these discussions, we and each potential acquisition candidate exchange confidential operational and financial information, conduct due diligence inquiries, and consider the structure, terms, and conditions of the potential acquisition. Potential acquisition discussions frequently take place over a long period of time and involve difficult business integration and other issues, including in some cases, management succession and related matters. As a result of these and other factors, a number of potential acquisitions that from time to time appear likely to occur do not result in binding legal agreements and are not consummated. In addition, we may have disagreements with potential acquisition targets, which could lead to litigation. Any of these factors or outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain the strength and value of our brands could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on the value and strength of our key brands, including Good Sam, Camping World, and Gander RV. These brands are integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, enhancing, promoting and positioning our brands, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality services, protection plans, products and resources and a consistent, high quality customer experience. Our brands could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives, if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations, if we are subject to publicized litigation or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Some of these risks may be beyond our ability to control, such as the effects of negative publicity regarding our manufacturers, suppliers or third-party providers of services or negative publicity related to members of management. Any of these events could result in decreases in revenues. Further, maintaining, enhancing, promoting and positioning our brands\u2019 image may require us to make substantial investments, which could adversely affect our cash flow, and which may ultimately be unsuccessful. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to successfully order and manage our inventory to reflect consumer demand in a volatile market and anticipate changing consumer preferences and buying trends has and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends upon our ability to successfully manage our inventory and to anticipate and respond to merchandise trends and consumer demands in a timely manner. Our products appeal to consumers who are, or could become, RV owners and enthusiasts across North America. The preferences of these consumers cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Further, the retail consumer industry, by its nature, is volatile and sensitive to numerous economic factors, including consumer preferences, competition, market conditions, general economic conditions and other factors outside of our control. We typically order merchandise well in advance of the following selling season making it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends, increases or decreases in consumer demand or changes in prices. If we misjudge either the market for our merchandise or our consumers\u2019 purchasing habits in the future, our revenues may decline significantly, and we may not have sufficient quantities of merchandise to satisfy consumer demand or sales orders, or we may be required to discount excess inventory, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in the normal course of business, we periodically will implement discounting to reduce our excess RV inventory. In addition, we have exited certain non-RV retail categories because we felt those categories did not have sufficient demand or sales margins to justify our inventory levels. These activities have negatively impacted our gross margin, operating margin and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOur same store revenue may fluctuate and may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.\nOur same store revenue may vary from quarter to quarter. In addition to the above risk factors a number of additional factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our same store revenue results, including:\n\u25cf changes or anticipated changes to regulations related to some of the products we sell or to the localities in which we operate;\n\u25cf our ability to provide quality customer service that will increase our conversion of shoppers into paying customers;\n\u25cf atypical weather patterns;\n\u25cf changes in our product mix;\n\u25cf changes in sales of Good Sam services and plans and retention and renewal rates for our annually renewing Good Sam services and plans; and\n\u25cf changes in pricing and average unit sales.\nAn unanticipated decline in revenues or same store revenue may cause the price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nOur business is seasonal and this leads to fluctuations in sales and revenues.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in revenue, net income and cash flows as a result of annual seasonality in our business. The RV outdoor and active sports specialty retail industries are cyclical and because RVs are used primarily by vacationers and campers, demand for services, protection plans, products and resources generally declines during the winter season, while sales and profits are generally highest during the spring and summer months. In addition, unusually severe weather conditions in some geographic areas may impact demand.\nOn average, over the three years ended December 31, 2021, we have generated 29.8% and 28.9% of our annual revenue in the second and third fiscal quarters, respectively, which include the spring and summer\nmonths. We have historically incurred additional expenses in the second and third fiscal quarters due to higher purchase volumes, increased staffing in our retail locations and program costs. If, for any reason, we miscalculate the demand for our products or our product mix during the second and third fiscal quarters, our sales in these quarters could decline, resulting in higher labor costs as a percentage of sales, lower margins and excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, SG&A expenses as a percentage of gross profit tend to be higher in the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of acquisitions and the seasonality of our business. We prefer to acquire new retail locations in the first and fourth quarters of each year in order to provide time for the location to be re-modeled and to ramp up operations ahead of the spring and summer months.\nDue to our seasonality, the possible adverse impact from other risks associated with our business, including atypical weather, consumer spending levels and general business conditions, is potentially greater if any such risks occur during our peak sales seasons.\nOur ability to operate and expand our business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will depend on the availability of adequate capital.\nThe operation of our business, the rate of our expansion and our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn depends on cash flow generated by our business and, if necessary, the availability of equity or debt capital. We also require sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations under our existing debt agreements. (See \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Description of Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Floor Plan Facility\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K). We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations or cash available under our financing agreements, including our $65.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) or our floor plan financing through the Eighth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended (\u201cFloor Plan Facility\u201d), will be sufficient to meet our needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, and if availability under our Revolving Credit Facility or our Floor Plan Facility is not sufficient, or if additional borrowings under our Real Estate Facility are unavailable, we may have to obtain additional financing. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations.\nCertain of our indebtedness, such as our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below) bears interest at variable interest rates based on the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). Although we expect that the capital and debt markets will cease to use LIBOR as a benchmark in the near future and the administrator of LIBOR has announced its intention to extend the publication of most tenors of LIBOR for U.S. dollars through June 30, 2023, we cannot predict whether or when all tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will actually cease to be available, at which point the Secured Overnight Funding Rate, or SOFR, will become the market benchmark in its place or what impact such a transition may have on our interest rates, business, financial condition and results of operations\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our Floor Plan Facility contain restrictive covenants that may impair our ability to access sufficient capital and operate our business.\nOur senior secured credit facilities, comprised of our $65.0 million revolving credit facility (\u201cthe Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and our $1.4 billion term loan facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) and our floor plan financing through our Eighth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended (the \u201cFloor Plan Facility\u201d) contain various provisions that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf incur additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf incur certain liens;\n\u25cf consolidate or merge;\n\u25cf alter the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions;\n\u25cf sell assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock or certain other indebtedness;\n\u25cf engage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u25cf enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our Floor Plan Facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios and provide for acceleration of the indebtedness thereunder in the case of certain events of default, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Description of Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Floor Plan Facility\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K and Note 9 - Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K. Our ability to comply with those financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, and our failure to comply with these ratios could result in an event of default. In an event of default, we may not have sufficient funds available, or we may not have access to sufficient capital from other sources, to repay any accelerated debt and our lenders could foreclose on liens which cover substantially all of our assets.\nWe primarily rely on six fulfillment and distribution centers for our retail, e-commerce and catalog businesses, and, if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at any such facility, we may be unable to deliver merchandise effectively to our stores or customers.\nWe handle almost all of our e-commerce and catalog orders and distribution to our retail stores through six fulfillment and distribution facilities (see \u201cItem 2. Properties\u201d under Part I of this Form 10-K). Any natural disaster or other serious disruption at any such facility due to fire, tornado, earthquake, flood or any other cause could damage our on-site inventory or impair our ability to use such distribution and fulfillment center. While we maintain business interruption insurance, as well as general property insurance, the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our losses in such an event. Any of these occurrences could impair our ability to adequately stock our stores or fulfill customer orders and harm our results of operations.\nNatural disasters, whether or not caused by climate change, unusual weather conditions, epidemic outbreaks, terrorist acts and political events could disrupt business and result in lower sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods, hail storms and earthquakes, unusual weather conditions, epidemic outbreaks such as Ebola, Zika virus, novel coronavirus or measles, terrorist attacks or disruptive political events in certain regions where our stores are located could adversely affect our business and result in lower sales. Severe weather, such as heavy snowfall or extreme temperatures, may discourage or restrict customers in a particular region from traveling to our stores or utilizing our products, thereby reducing our sales and profitability. Natural disasters including tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, hailstorms and earthquakes may damage our stores or other operations, which may materially adversely affect our consolidated financial results. The public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by governments, businesses, including us and our vendors, and the public at large to limit COVID-19's spread have had, and could again have in the future, certain negative impacts on our business including product shortages and reduced customer demand for our products. In addition to business interruption, our retail business is subject to substantial risk of property loss due to the concentration of property at our retail locations. To the extent these events also impact one or more of our key suppliers or result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers or our corporate headquarters, we may be unable to maintain inventory balances, maintain delivery schedules or provide other support functions to our stores.\nOur insurance coverage may also be insufficient to cover all losses related to such events. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our relationships with third-party providers of services, protection plans, products and resources and a disruption of these relationships or of these providers\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business depends in part on developing and maintaining productive relationships with third-party providers of services, protection plans, products and resources that we market to our customers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sourced our products from over 2,800 domestic and international vendors. Additionally, we rely on certain third-party providers to support our services, protection plans, products and resources, including insurance carriers for our property and casualty insurance and extended service contracts, banks and captive financing companies for vehicle financing and refinancing, Comenity Capital Bank as the issuer of our co-branded credit card and a tow provider network for our roadside assistance programs. We cannot accurately predict when, or the extent to which, we will experience any disruption in the supply of products from our vendors or services from our third-party providers. Any such disruption could negatively impact our ability to market and sell our services, protection plans, products and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Comenity Capital Bank could decline to renew our services agreement or become insolvent and unable to perform our contract, and we may be unable to timely find a replacement bank to provide these services.\nWe depend on merchandise purchased from our vendors to obtain products for our retail locations. We have no contractual arrangements providing for continued supply from our key vendors, and our vendors may discontinue selling to us at any time. Changes in commercial practices of our key vendors or manufacturers, such as changes in vendor support and incentives or changes in credit or payment terms, could also negatively impact our results. If we lose one or more key vendors or are unable to promptly replace a vendor that is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products at comparable prices, we may not be able to offer products that are important to our merchandise assortment.\nWe also are subject to risks, such as the price and availability of raw materials, shipping delays, labor disputes, union organizing activity, strikes, inclement weather, natural disasters, war and terrorism and adverse general economic and political conditions that might limit our vendors\u2019 ability to provide us with quality merchandise on a timely and cost-efficient basis. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality and more expensive than those we currently purchase. Any delay or failure in offering quality products and services to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe offer emergency roadside assistance to our customers at a fixed price per year and we pay our tow provider network based on usage. If the amount of emergency roadside claims substantially exceeds our estimates or if our tow provider is unable to adequately respond to calls, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWith respect to the insurance programs that we offer, we are dependent on the insurance carriers that underwrite the insurance to obtain appropriate regulatory approvals and maintain compliance with insurance regulations. If such carriers are out of compliance, we may be required to use an alternative carrier or products or cease marketing certain products in certain states, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are required to use an alternative carrier or change our products, it may materially increase the time required to bring an insurance related product to market. Any disruption in our service offerings could harm our reputation and result in customer dissatisfaction.\nAdditionally, we provide financing to qualified customers through a number of third-party financing providers. If one or more of these third-party providers ceases to provide financing to our customers, provides financing to fewer customers or no longer provides financing on competitive terms, or if we were unable to replace the current third-party providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause certain of the products that we sell are manufactured abroad, we may face delays, new or increased tariffs, increased cost or quality control deficiencies in the importation of these products, which could reduce our net sales and profitability.\nA portion of the products that we purchase for resale, including those purchased from domestic suppliers, is manufactured abroad in China and other countries. In addition, we believe most of our private label merchandise is manufactured abroad. Trade tensions between the United States and China, and other countries escalated in recent years. U.S. tariff impositions against Chinese exports have generally been followed by retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports to China. We may not be able to mitigate the impacts of any future tariffs, and our business, results of operations and financial position would be materially adversely affected. As a result, our foreign imports, in particular imports from China, subject us to the risks of changes in, or the imposition of new import tariffs, duties or quotas, new restrictions on imports, loss of \u201cmost favored nation\u201d status with the United States for a particular foreign country, antidumping or countervailing duty orders, retaliatory actions in response to illegal trade practices, work stoppages, delays in shipment, freight expense increases, product cost increases due to foreign currency fluctuations or revaluations and economic uncertainties. If any of these or other factors were to cause a disruption of trade from the countries in which the suppliers of our vendors are located or impose additional costs in connection with the purchase of our products, we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of products to satisfy our requirements and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTo the extent that any foreign manufacturers which supply products to us directly or indirectly utilize quality control standards, labor practices or other practices that vary from those legally mandated or commonly accepted in the United States, we could be hurt by any resulting negative publicity or, in some cases, face potential liability.\nA portion of our net income is from financing, insurance and extended service contracts, which depend on third-party lenders and insurance companies. We cannot assure you third-party lending institutions will continue to provide financing for RV purchases.\nA portion of our net income comes from the fees we receive from lending institutions and insurance companies for arranging financing and insurance coverage for our customers unless customers prepay the financing within a specified period (generally within six months of making the loan), in which case we are required to rebate (or \u201cchargeback\u201d) all or a portion of the commissions paid to us by the lending institution. Our revenues from financing fees and vehicle service contract fees are recorded net of a reserve for estimated future chargebacks based on historical operating results. Lending institutions may change the criteria or terms they use to make loan decisions, which could reduce the number of customers for whom we can arrange financing, or may elect to not continue to provide these products with respect to RVs. Our customers may also use the internet or other electronic methods to find financing alternatives. If any of these events occur, we could lose a significant portion of our income and profit.\nFurthermore, new and used vehicles may be sold and financed through retail installment sales contracts entered into between us and third-party purchasers. Prior to entering into a retail installment sales contract with a third-party purchaser, we typically have a commitment from a third-party lender for the assignment of such retail installment sales contract, subject to final review, approval and verification of the retail installment sales contract, related documentation and the information contained therein. Retail installment sales contracts are typically assigned by us to third-party lenders simultaneously with the execution of the retail installment sales contracts. Contracts in transit represent amounts due from third-party lenders from whom pre-arranged assignment agreements have been determined, and to whom the retail installment sales contracts have been assigned. We recognize revenue from the sale of new and used vehicles upon completion of the sale to the customer. Conditions to completing a sale include having an agreement with the customer, including pricing, whereby the sales price must be reasonably expected to be collected and having control transferred to the customer. Funding from the third-party lender is provided upon receipt, final review, approval and verification of the retail installment sales contract, related documentation and the information contained therein. Retail installment sales contracts are typically funded within ten days of the initial approval of the retail installment sales contract by the third-party lender. Contracts in transit are included in current assets in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K and totaled $57.7 million and $48.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Any defaults on these retail\ninstallment sales contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to retain senior executives and attract and retain other qualified employees, our business might be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for these types of personnel is high. We may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct our operations successfully and, in such an event, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our success also depends to a significant extent on the continued service and performance of our senior management team, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marcus Lemonis. The loss of any member of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our business plan and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, certain members of our management team, including Mr. Lemonis, currently pursue and may continue to pursue other business ventures, which could divert their attention from executing on our business plan and objectives. We do not currently maintain key-man life insurance policies on any member of our senior management team or other key employees.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space.\nWe lease substantially all of the real properties where we have retail operations as well as certain corporate offices and distribution centers. Our leases generally provide for fixed monthly rentals with escalation clauses and range from five to twenty years. The profitability of our business is in part dependent on renewing leases for stores in desirable locations and, if necessary, identifying and closing underperforming stores or relocating these stores to alternative locations in a cost-effective manner. Typically, a large portion of a store\u2019s operating expense is the cost associated with leasing the location.\nAdditionally, over time our current store locations may not continue to be desirable because of changes in demographics within the surrounding area or a decline in shopping traffic, including traffic generated by other nearby stores. Although we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions by making certain payments, we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so. If we decide to close stores, we are generally required to either continue to pay rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or, for certain locations, pay exercise rights to terminate, which in either case could be expensive. Even if we are able to assign or sublease vacated locations where our lease cannot be terminated, we may remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform.\nIf we are unable to service our lease expenses or are unable to, on favorable terms, negotiate renewals of leases at desirable locations or identify and close underperforming locations, we may be forced to seek alternative sites in our target markets, which may be difficult and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur private brand offerings expose us to various risks.\nWe expect to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings through a combination of brands that we own and brands that we license from third parties. We have invested in our development and procurement resources and marketing efforts relating to these private brand offerings. Although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers at each price point and provide us with higher gross margins than comparable third-party branded products we sell, the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to certain specific risks in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this section, such as:\n\u25cf potential mandatory or voluntary product recalls;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights (including defending against counterfeit, knock offs, grey-market, infringing or otherwise unauthorized goods);\n\u25cf our ability to successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully administer and comply with obligations under license agreements that we have with the licensors of brands, including, in some instances, certain minimum sales requirements that, if not met, could cause us to lose the licensing rights or pay damages; and\n\u25cf other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail.\nAn increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors\u2019 products, which may, in turn, adversely affect our relationship with our vendors. Our failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could incur asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. At least annually, we review goodwill for impairment. Long-lived assets, operating lease assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Our determination of future cash flows, future recoverability and fair value of our long-lived assets as well as the reporting unit fair value used in our goodwill analysis include significant estimates and assumptions. Changes in those estimates or assumptions or lower than anticipated future financial performance may result in the identification of an impaired asset and a non-cash impairment charge, which could be material. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Long-Lived Asset Impairment to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K for a discussion of impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2021. We may in the future identify additional impairment charges and any such charges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to Regulation and Litigation\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations.\nOur operations are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation, including our RV sales, RV financing, outbound telemarketing, direct mail, roadside assistance programs, insurance activities, and the sale of extended service contracts. New regulatory efforts may be proposed from time to time that have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our businesses or our results of operations. For example, in the past a principal source of leads for our direct response marketing efforts was new vehicle registrations provided by motor vehicle departments in various states. Currently, all states restrict access to motor vehicle registration information.\nWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business or limit the services we are able to offer. In the area of information security and data protection, the laws in several states in the United States and most countries require companies to implement specific privacy and information security controls and legal protections to protect certain types of personally identifiable information and to collect or use it subject to disclosures and certain consent-based requirements. Likewise, most states in the United States and most countries have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their personally identifiable information. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) establishes a new privacy framework that expands the definition of personal information, establishes new data privacy rights for consumers residing in the State of California, imposes special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, creates new notice obligations and new limits on the sale of personal information, and creates a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for (i) violations of the CCPA and (ii) businesses that\nexperience certain types of data breaches. Additionally, a new ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. Several other states are enacting or in the process of proposing legislation that mirrors may aspects of the CCPA and CPRA.\nWe are also subject to federal and numerous state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale, transportation and marketing of motor vehicles, including so-called \u201clemon laws.\u201d Federal, state and local laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the length and width of motor vehicles that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways. Certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions. Federal and state authorities also have various environmental control standards relating to air, water, noise pollution and hazardous waste generation and disposal which affect our business and operations.\nAreas of our business also affected by laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, labor (including federal and state minimum wage increases), advertising, consumer protection, real estate, promotions, quality of services, intellectual property, tax, import and export, anti-corruption, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety. Compliance with these laws and others may be onerous and costly, at times, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction which further complicates compliance efforts.\nFurthermore, our property and casualty insurance programs, and our extended service contracts that we offer through third-party insurance carriers are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the business of insurance, including, without limitation, laws and regulations governing the administration, underwriting, marketing, solicitation, liability obligations or sale of insurance programs. Any failure by us or our third-party insurance providers to comply with current licensing and approval requirements could result in such regulators denying their initial or renewal applications for such licenses, modifying the terms of licenses or revoking licenses that they currently possess, which could severely inhibit our ability to market these products. Additionally, certain state laws and regulations govern the form and content of certain disclosures that must be made in connection with the sale, advertising or offer of any insurance program to a consumer. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be ordered to pay fines or penalties by regulators or to discontinue certain products.\nWe offer extended service contracts and gap insurance that may be purchased as a supplement to the original purchaser\u2019s warranty. These products are subject to complex federal and state laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which these products are offered will not seek to regulate or restrict these products. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including with respect to the transfer of administration and liability obligations associated with these extended service contracts to a third party upon purchase by the customer, could result in fines or other penalties including orders by state regulators to discontinue sales of the warranty products in one or more jurisdictions. Such a result could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nState dealer laws generally provide that a manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non-renewal. If such dealer laws are repealed in the states in which we operate, manufacturers may be able to terminate our dealer agreements without providing advance notice, an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause. Without the protection of state dealer laws, it may also be more difficult for our dealerships to renew their dealer agreements upon expiration.\nIn addition, in connection with our previous sale of firearms in our stores, we were required to comply with a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to the sale of firearms and ammunition, including the federal Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. If we failed to comply with Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (the \u201cATF\u201d) rules and regulations during the period we sold firearms, the ATF may levy fines against us.\nSeveral states currently have laws in effect that are similar to, and in certain cases, more restrictive than, these federal laws. Compliance with all of these regulations is costly and time-consuming. Inadvertent violation of any of these regulations could cause us to incur fines and penalties and may also lead to restrictions on our ability to manufacture and sell our products and services and to import or export the products we sell.\nWe have instituted various and comprehensive policies and procedures to address compliance. However, there can be no assurance that employees, contractors, vendors or our agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures. For more information on the various regulations applicable to our business, see \u201cItem I. Business-Laws and Regulations\u201d under Part I of this Form 10-K.\nOur failure to comply with certain environmental regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling and/or disposal of materials such as motor oil and filters, transmission fluids, antifreeze, refrigerants, paints, thinners, batteries, cleaning products, lubricants, degreasing agents, tires and propane. Consequently, our business is subject to a complex variety of federal, state and local requirements that regulate the environment, public health and safety, and we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. Our failure to comply with these regulations could cause us to become subject to fines and penalties or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we have indemnified certain of our landlords for any hazardous waste which may be found on or about property we lease. If any such hazardous waste were to be found on property that we occupy, a significant claim giving rise to our indemnity obligation could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the RVs we sell.\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency has adopted rules under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles. The adoption of any laws or regulations requiring significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on vehicles and automotive fuels in the United States could adversely affect demand for those vehicles and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure in our e-commerce operations, security breaches and cybersecurity risks could disrupt our business and lead to reduced sales and growth prospects and reputational damage.\nConsumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, a growing portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers is occurring online and through mobile commerce applications and a declining portion of total consumer expenditures is occurring at brick and mortar retail locations. Our e-commerce business is an important element of our brands and relationship with our customers, and we expect it to continue to grow. In addition to changing consumer preferences and shifting traffic patterns and buying trends in e-commerce, we are vulnerable to additional risks and uncertainties associated with e-commerce sales, including rapid changes in technology, website downtime and other technical failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks, consumer privacy concerns, changes in state tax regimes and government regulation of internet activities. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce our e-commerce sales, increase our costs, diminish our growth prospects and damage our brands, which could negatively impact our results of operations and stock price.\nIn addition, there is no guarantee that we will be able to expand our e-commerce business. Our competitors may have e-commerce businesses that are substantially larger and more developed than ours, which places us at a competitive disadvantage. Although we continually update our websites, we may not be successful in implementing improved website features and there is no guarantee that such improvements will expand our e-commerce business. If we are unable to expand our e-commerce business, our growth plans will suffer, and the price of our common stock could decline.\nWe may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe own a variety of registered trademarks and service marks for the names of our clubs, magazines and other publications. We also own the copyrights to certain articles in our publications. We believe that our trademarks and copyrights have significant value and are important to our marketing efforts. If we are unable to continue to protect the trademarks and service marks for our proprietary brands, if such marks become generic or if third parties adopt marks similar to our marks, our ability to differentiate our products and services may be diminished. In the event that our trademarks or service marks are successfully challenged by third parties, we could lose brand recognition and be forced to devote additional resources to advertising and marketing new brands for our products.\nFrom time to time, we may be compelled to protect our intellectual property, which may involve litigation. Such litigation may be time-consuming, expensive and distract our management from running the day-to-day operations of our business, and could result in the impairment or loss of the involved intellectual property. There is no guarantee that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property, including litigation when necessary, will be successful. The loss or reduction of any of our significant intellectual property rights could diminish our ability to distinguish our products from competitors\u2019 products and retain our market share for our proprietary products. Our inability to effectively protect our proprietary intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOther parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us or the payment of damages. These claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain or upgrade our information technology systems or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient.\nWe depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business. We rely on certain hardware, telecommunications and software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business. Various components of our information technology systems, including hardware, networks, and software, are licensed to us by third-party vendors. We rely extensively on our information technology systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Additionally, because we accept debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (the \u201cPCI Standard\u201d), issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. Costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology such as those necessary to maintain compliance with the PCI Standard or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Any material interruptions or failures in our payment-related systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny disruptions or breaches involving our or our third-party providers\u2019 information technology systems or network security could interrupt our operations, compromise our reputation, expose us to litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the integrity, security and successful functioning of our information technology systems and network infrastructure (collectively, \u201cIT Systems\u201d) across our operations. While we own and operate certain parts of our IT Systems, we also rely on critical third-party service providers for an array of software, technologies, tools and services. We use IT Systems for external and internal functions, such as to support product sales, our Good Sam services and plans, manage procurement and our supply chain, track inventory information at our retail locations, communicate customer information and aggregate daily sales, margin and promotional information. We also use IT Systems to report and audit our operational results.\nIn addition, we and our third-party providers have access to, collect, process and maintain private or confidential information regarding our customers, club members, associates and suppliers, as well as our business. For example, we have over 30 million unique contacts in our database as of December 31, 2021. This customer database includes information about our approximately 2.1 million club members and our 5.5 million Active Customers as of December 31, 2021.\nWe and our third-party providers experience cyberattacks and security incidents from time to time. For example, in February 2022, we announced that we were experiencing a cybersecurity incident (the \u201cCybersecurity Incident\u201d) that resulted in the encryption of certain IT Systems and theft of certain data and information. The Cybersecurity Incident resulted in our temporary inability to access certain of our IT Systems, caused by the disabling of some of our IT Systems by the threat actor and our temporarily taking certain other IT Systems offline as a precautionary measure. We engaged leading outside forensics and cybersecurity experts, launched containment and remediation efforts and a forensic investigation, and are working on restoring and enhancing the security of our IT Systems. We are also coordinating with law enforcement. We are in the early stages of this incident and have not determined the full scope or content of our lost or stolen data. We have and expect to continue to incur incremental costs for the investigation, containment and remediation of the Cybersecurity Incident, including legal and other professional fees, and investments to enhance the security of our IT Systems. The containment, investigation, remediation, legal and other costs may exceed our insurance policy limits or may not be covered by insurance at all. We have not yet determined if the Cybersecurity Incident will cause future disruptions to our business or how long such disruption could last. We have also not yet been able to estimate the incremental costs resulting from the Cybersecurity Incident, which are expected to adversely impact our future financial results. Other actual and potential consequences include, but are not limited to, negative publicity, reputational damage, lost trust with customers, regulatory enforcement action, and litigation that could result in financial judgments or the payment of settlement amounts and disputes with insurance carriers concerning coverage.\nDespite our security controls and measures, we are vulnerable to threats resulting from malware (for example, ransomware), viruses, misconduct by external or inside actors, social engineering, human error by associates and contractors, as well as from bugs, misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in our software code. We are also vulnerable to further successful cyberattacks, security breaches and disruptions to our IT Systems and our electronic data and information assets, in addition to damage or interruption from earthquakes, acts of war or terrorist attacks, floods, fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, power loss and outages, computer and telecommunications failures and similar incidents. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The COVID-19 pandemic has also presented additional operational and cybersecurity risks due to the prevalence of work-from-home arrangements.\nWe expect cyberattacks to accelerate going forward. Threat actors are becoming more sophisticated and difficult to anticipate or deflect as they increasingly use tools and techniques designed to circumvent security controls, to avoid detection, and to remove forensic evidence that may be needed to effectively identify, investigate and remediate attacks. Any errors or vulnerabilities in our IT Systems, damage to or failure of our IT Systems, or significant breach of club member, customer, employee, supplier, or company data, could result in interruptions in our services, noncompliance with certain regulations, substantial negative media attention, damage to our club member, customer and supplier relationships and our reputation, exposure to litigation (including class actions), regulatory investigations, and lost sales, fines, penalties, lawsuits, and increased remediation costs, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any remediation measures that we have taken or that we may undertake in the future in response to the security incident announced in February 2022 or other security breaches may be insufficient to prevent future attacks.\nIn addition, the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across our business. In addition, customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information from cyber attack or other security breaches. A significant breach of club member, customer, employee, supplier, or company data could attract a substantial amount of negative media attention, damage our club member, customer and supplier relationships and our reputation, and result in lost sales, fines and/or lawsuits, and new laws such as the CCPA impose statutory damages for certain types of data breaches that affect the personal information of consumers.\nWe maintain insurance to cover costs in the event of a breach, interruption of service, or other cyber-security event. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell.\nSome of the products we sell may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability. In addition, even if a product liability claim is not successful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding a product recall or any assertion that our products caused property damage or personal injury could damage our brand identity and our reputation with existing and potential consumers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny increase in the frequency and size of these claims, as compared to our experience in prior years, may cause the premium that we are required to pay for insurance to increase significantly and may negatively impact future insurance costs. It may also increase the amounts we pay in punitive damages, not all of which are covered by our insurance.\nWe have been named in litigation, which has resulted in substantial costs and may result in reputational harm and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe face legal risks in our business, including claims from disputes with our employees and our former employees and claims associated with general commercial disputes, product liability and other matters. Risks associated with legal liability often are difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time.\nWe have been named in the past, are currently named and may be named in the future as defendants of class action lawsuits. For example, we were named as a defendant in a class action lawsuit by Camp Coast to Coast club members, which alleged certain violations of California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law at Business and Professions Code and other laws, relating to our sale of trip points and certain advertising and marketing materials.\nWe are currently subject to securities class action litigation and may be subject to similar or other litigation in the future. For information regarding these lawsuits, refer to Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies - Litigation of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe results of the securities class action lawsuits, shareholder derivative lawsuits, and any other future legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of their subject matter or merits, such legal proceedings have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in significant cost to us, which may not be covered by insurance, may divert the attention of management or may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Negative publicity from litigation, whether or not resulting in a substantial cost, could materially damage our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the price of our Class A common stock. In addition, such legal proceedings may make it more difficult to finance our operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Organizational Structure\nMarcus Lemonis, through his beneficial ownership of our shares directly or indirectly held by ML Acquisition and ML RV Group, has substantial control over us, including over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, and his interests, along with the interests of our other Continuing Equity Owners, in our business may conflict with yours.\nAs discussed in Note 18 \u2500 Stockholders\u2019 Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K, we entered into a voting agreement in connection with our IPO with ML Acquisition Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which is indirectly owned by each of Stephen\nAdams and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marcus Lemonis (\u201cML Acquisition\u201d), ML RV Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, wholly owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marcus Lemonis (\u201cML RV Group\u201d), CVRV Acquisition LLC and CVRV Acquisition II LLC (the \u201cVoting Agreement\u201d). Subject to the Voting Agreement, Marcus Lemonis, through his beneficial ownership of our shares directly or indirectly held by ML Acquisition and ML RV Group, may approve or disapprove substantially all transactions and other matters requiring approval by our stockholders, such as a merger, consolidation, dissolution or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, the issuance or redemption of certain additional equity interests, and the election of directors including transactions that may not be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock or, conversely, prevent the consummation of transactions that may be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Voting Agreement, Crestview Advisors, L.L.C., a registered investment adviser to private equity funds, including funds affiliated with Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. (\u201cCrestview\u201d) currently has the right to designate one of our directors (the \u201cCrestview Director\u201d). Each of ML Acquisition and ML RV Group has agreed to vote, or cause to vote, all of their outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock at any annual or special meeting of stockholders in which directors are elected, so as to cause the election of the Crestview Director. In addition, the ML Related Parties also currently have the right to designate four of our directors (the \u201cML Acquisition Directors\u201d). Moreover, ML RV Group has the right to designate one director for as long as it holds our one share of Class C common stock (the \u201cML RV Director\u201d). As described in the Voting Agreement, these designation rights are subject to change based on the relevant parties\u2019 ownership of Class A common stock. Funds controlled by Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. have agreed to vote, or cause to vote, all of their outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock at any annual or special meeting of stockholders in which directors are elected, so as to cause the election of the ML Acquisition Directors and the ML RV Director. Additionally, pursuant to the Voting Agreement, we are required to take commercially reasonable action to cause (i) the Board of Directors to be comprised at least of nine directors absent an appropriate waiver or approval to increase or decrease the size of the Board (which the Company obtained to set the Board at eight directors); (ii) the individuals designated in accordance with the terms of the Voting Agreement to be included in the slate of nominees to be elected to the board of directors at the next annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company at which directors are to be elected and at each annual meeting of stockholders of the Company thereafter at which a director\u2019s term expires; (iii) the individuals designated in accordance with the terms of the Voting Agreement to fill the applicable vacancies on the board of directors; and (iv) a ML Acquisition Director or the ML RV Director to be the chairperson of the board of directors (as defined in our amended and restated bylaws). The Voting Agreement allows for the board of directors to reject the nomination, appointment or election of a particular director if such nomination, appointment or election would constitute a breach of the board of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties to the Company\u2019s stockholders or does not otherwise comply with any requirements of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or the charter for, or related guidelines of, the board of directors\u2019 nominating and corporate governance committee.\nThe Voting Agreement further provides that, for so long as the ML Related Parties, directly or indirectly, beneficially own, in the aggregate, 22.5% or more of our Class A common stock (assuming that all outstanding common units in CWGS, LLC are redeemed for newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis), the approval of the ML Related Parties will be required for certain corporate actions. These actions include: (1) a change of control; (2) acquisitions or dispositions of assets above $100 million; (3) the issuance of securities of Camping World Holdings, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries (other than under equity incentive plans that have received the prior approval of our board of directors); (4) material amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; and (5) any change in the size of the board of directors. The Voting Agreement also provides that, for so long as the ML Related Parties, directly or indirectly, beneficially own, in the aggregate, 28% or more of our Class A common stock (assuming that all outstanding common units of CWGS, LLC are redeemed for newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock, on a one-for-one basis), the approval of the ML Related Parties, as applicable, will be required for the hiring and termination of our Chief Executive Officer; provided, however, that the approval of the ML Related Parties is only required at such time as Marcus Lemonis no longer serves as our Chief Executive Officer. These rights may prevent the consummation of transactions that may be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d does not apply with respect to any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our affiliates.\nThe doctrine of corporate opportunity generally provides that a corporate fiduciary may not develop an opportunity using corporate resources, acquire an interest adverse to that of the corporation or acquire property that is reasonably incident to the present or prospective business of the corporation or in which the corporation has a present or expectancy interest, unless that opportunity is first presented to the corporation and the corporation chooses not to pursue that opportunity. The doctrine of corporate opportunity is intended to preclude officers or directors or other fiduciaries from personally benefiting from opportunities that belong to the corporation. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d does not apply with respect to any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our affiliates. Any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our affiliates therefore has no duty to communicate or present corporate opportunities to us, and has the right to either hold any corporate opportunity for their (and their affiliates\u2019) own account and benefit or to recommend, assign or otherwise transfer such corporate opportunity to persons other than us, including to any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our affiliates.\nAs a result, certain of our stockholders, directors and their respective affiliates are not prohibited from operating or investing in competing businesses. We therefore may find ourselves in competition with certain of our stockholders, directors or their respective affiliates, and we may not have knowledge of, or be able to pursue, transactions that could potentially be beneficial to us. Accordingly, we may lose a corporate opportunity or suffer competitive harm, which could negatively impact our business or prospects.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE listing requirements and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such corporate governance requirements.\nPursuant to the terms of the Voting Agreement, Marcus Lemonis, through his beneficial ownership of our shares directly or indirectly held by ML Acquisition and ML RV Group, and certain funds controlled by Crestview Partners II GP, L.P., in the aggregate, have more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors, and, as a result, we are considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d for the purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) listing requirements. As such, we qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements to have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors, an entirely independent nominating and corporate governance committee, an entirely independent compensation committee or to perform an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nThe corporate governance requirements and specifically the independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who are considered independent are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. We have utilized, and intend to continue to utilize, certain exemptions afforded to a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d As a result, we are not subject to certain corporate governance requirements, including that a majority of our board of directors consists of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under the rules of the NYSE. In addition, we are not required to have a nominating and corporate governance committee or compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities or to conduct annual performance evaluations of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees and currently we do not have an entirely independent nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nOur principal asset is our interest in CWGS, LLC, and accordingly, we depend on distributions from CWGS, LLC to pay dividends, taxes and expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. CWGS, LLC\u2019s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.\nWe are a holding company and had no material assets as of December 31, 2021, other than our ownership of 44,130,956 common units, representing a 51.2% economic interest in the business of CWGS, LLC, and cash of $71.0 million. We have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay dividends in the future, if any, will be dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of CWGS, LLC and its subsidiaries and distributions we receive from CWGS, LLC. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to dividend or distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative covenants in our debt instruments, will permit such dividends or distributions.\nCWGS, LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to holders of its common units, including us. As a result, we incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of CWGS, LLC. Under the terms of the CWGS LLC Agreement, CWGS, LLC is obligated to make tax distributions to holders of its common units, including us, except to the extent such distributions would render CWGS, LLC insolvent or are otherwise prohibited by law or our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, our Floor Plan Facility or any of our future debt agreements. In addition to tax expenses, we will also incur expenses related to our operations, our interests in CWGS, LLC and related party agreements, including payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and expenses and costs of being a public company, all of which could be significant. We intend, as its managing member, to cause CWGS, LLC to make distributions in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and operating expenses, including any ordinary course payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, CWGS, LLC\u2019s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions including, but not limited to, restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which CWGS, LLC is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering CWGS, LLC insolvent. If CWGS, LLC does not have sufficient funds to pay tax distributions or other liabilities to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore may accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. If CWGS, LLC does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends may also be restricted or impaired. See \u201c- Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock.\u201d\nOur Tax Receivable Agreement with the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. requires us to make cash payments to them in respect of certain tax benefits to which we may become entitled, and the amounts that we may be required to pay could be significant.\nIn connection with our IPO, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with CWGS, LLC, each of the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. which confers certain benefits upon the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. that do not benefit the holders of our Class A common stock to the same extent as it benefits such Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are required to make cash payments to the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. equal to 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize as a result of (i) increases in tax basis resulting from the purchase of common units from Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. in exchange for Class A common stock in connection with the consummation of the IPO and the related corporate reorganization transactions and any future redemptions that are funded by Camping World Holdings, Inc. or exchanges of common units and (ii) certain other tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The amount of the cash payments that we may be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be significant. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, which tax reporting positions are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. Any payments made by us to the\nContinuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us. Nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore may accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that may be deemed realized under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are also not conditioned upon the Continuing Equity Owners or Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. maintaining a continued ownership interest in CWGS, LLC.\nAdditional liabilities under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be required to be recorded when CWGS, LLC units are exchanged in the future. Such amounts of cash payments that the Company may be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement for such future exchanges could be significant. The amount of liabilities to be recorded in the future for such exchanges is dependent on a variety of factors including future stock prices, tax rates in effect, and the Company\u2019s ability to utilize the tax benefits created as a result of the futures of CWGS, LLC units. The significance of these factors and related uncertainty associated with the related liabilities makes estimation of future potential amounts under the Tax Receivable Agreement impractical to determine.\nThe amounts that we may be required to pay to the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated in certain circumstances and may also significantly exceed the actual tax benefits that we ultimately realize.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that if certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control were to occur, if we materially breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then the Tax Receivable Agreement will terminate and our obligations, or our successor\u2019s obligations, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement would accelerate and become immediately due and payable. The amount due and payable in those circumstances is determined based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise.\nAs a result of the foregoing, (i) we could be required to make cash payments to the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made to the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement if any tax benefits initially claimed by us are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to a Continuing Equity Owner or Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, a challenge to any tax benefits initially claimed by us may not arise for\na number of years following the initial time of such payment or, even if challenged early, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement and, as a result, there might not be future cash payments from which to net against. The applicable U.S. federal income tax rules are complex and factual in nature, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not disagree with our tax reporting positions. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings.\nOur organizational structure may cause us to be subject to IRS audit, which may result in the assessment of interest and penalties.\nWe consolidate CWGS, LLC, which, as a limited liability company, is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes. Rather, the partnership\u2019s taxable income flows through to the owners, who are responsible for paying the applicable income taxes on the income allocated to them. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the Company is subject to partnership audit rules enacted as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the \u201cCentralized Partnership Audit Regime\u201d). Under the Centralized Partnership Audit Regime, any IRS audit of CWGS, LLC would be conducted at the CWGS, LLC level, and if the IRS determines an adjustment is necessary, the default rule is that CWGS, LLC would pay an \u201cimputed underpayment\u201d including interest and penalties, if applicable. CWGS, LLC may instead elect to make a \u201cpush-out\u201d election, in which case the partners for the year that is under audit would be required to take into account the adjustments on their own personal income tax returns.\nOur operating agreement stipulates that CWGS, LLC is indemnified by members for any payment made to relevant taxing authorities under the Centralized Partnership Audit Regime. It is intended that any payment CWGS, LLC makes on behalf of its current members will be reflected as a distribution, rather than tax expense, at the time that such distribution is declared.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe Continuing Equity Owners (through common units) own interests in CWGS, LLC, and the Continuing Equity Owners have the right to redeem their interests in CWGS, LLC pursuant to the terms of the CWGS LLC Agreement for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock or cash.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of 202,194,741 shares of Class A common stock authorized but unissued, including 42,094,536 shares of Class A common stock issuable, at our election, upon redemption of CWGS, LLC common units held by the Continuing Equity Owners. In connection with our IPO, CWGS, LLC entered into the CWGS LLC Agreement, and subject to certain restrictions set forth therein, the Continuing Equity Owners are entitled to have their common units redeemed from time to time at each of their options for, at our election (determined solely by our independent directors (within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE) who are disinterested), newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or a cash payment equal to a volume weighted average market price of one share of Class A common stock for each common unit redeemed, in each case in accordance with the terms of the CWGS LLC Agreement; provided that, at our election (determined solely by our independent directors (within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE) who are disinterested), we may effect a direct exchange of such Class A common stock or such cash, as applicable, for such common units. The Continuing Equity Owners may exercise such redemption right for as long as their common units remain outstanding. In connection with our IPO, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to which the shares of Class A common stock issued upon such redemption and the shares of Class A common stock issued to the Former Equity Owners in connection with the corporate reorganization transactions entered into in connection therewith will be eligible for resale, subject to certain limitations set forth therein. The market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of these redemptions or sales, or as a result of the perception that they could occur.\nYou may be diluted by future issuances of additional Class A common stock or common units in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise; future sales of such shares in the public market, or the expectations that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of our Class A common stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to our Class A common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise.\nWe have reserved shares for issuance under our 2016 Incentive Award Plan (the \u201c2016 Plan\u201d) in an amount equal to 11,313,399 shares of Class A common stock as of December 31, 2021, including shares of Class A common stock issuable pursuant to 271,543 stock options and 4,177,460 restricted stock units that were granted to certain of our directors and certain of our employees. Any Class A common stock that we issue, including under our 2016 Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership of holders of our Class A common stock.\nIn the future, we may also issue additional securities if we need to raise capital, including, but not limited to, in connection with acquisitions, which could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our structure and statutory restrictions.\nWe have paid a regular cash dividend using distributions from CWGS, LLC, including all or a portion of the Excess Tax Distribution, to the holders of our Class A common stock from time to time, subject to the discretion of our board of directors. However, the payment of future dividends on our Class A common stock will be subject to our discretion as the sole managing member of CWGS, LLC, the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Additionally, our ability to distribute any Excess Tax Distribution will also be subject to no early termination or amendment of the Tax Receivable Agreement, as well as the amount of tax distributions actually paid to us and our actual tax liability. As a consequence of these limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our Class A common stock. Additionally, any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. For additional information on our payments of dividends, see \"Item 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Dividend Policy\" under Part II of this Form 10-K.\nDelaware law and certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change the direction or management of our company.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf our Board of Directors is classified into three classes, each of which serves for a staggered three-year term;\n\u25cf a majority of our stockholders or a majority of our board of directors may call special meetings of our stockholders, and at such time as the ML Related Parties, directly or indirectly, beneficially own in the aggregate, less than 27.5% of all of the outstanding common units of CWGS, LLC, only the chairperson of our board of directors or a majority of our board of directors may call special meetings of our stockholders;\n\u25cf we have authorized undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u25cf any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders at an annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a written consent is signed by the holders of our outstanding shares of common stock representing not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize such action at a meeting at which all outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon, and at such time as the ML Related Parties, directly or indirectly, beneficially own in the aggregate, less than 27.5% of all of the outstanding common units of CWGS, LLC, any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders at an annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders may not be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u25cf our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes which all our stockholders would be eligible to cast in an election of directors and our amended and restated bylaws may be amended or repealed by a majority vote of our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes which all our stockholders would be eligible to cast in an election of directors, and at such time as the ML Related Parties, directly or indirectly, beneficially own in the aggregate, less than 27.5% of all of the outstanding common units of CWGS, LLC, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of the votes which all our stockholders would be entitled to cast in any annual election of directors and our amended and restated bylaws may also be amended or repealed by a majority vote of our board of directors;\n\u25cf we require advance notice and duration of ownership requirements for stockholder proposals; and\n\u25cf we have opted out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), however, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that are similar to Section 203 of the DGCL (except with respect to ML Acquisition and Crestview and any of their respective affiliates and any of their respective direct or indirect transferees of Class B common stock).\nThese provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire, including actions that you may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nPlease see \u201c- Risks Relating to Our Organizational Structure - Marcus Lemonis, through his beneficial ownership of our shares directly or indirectly held by ML Acquisition and ML RV Group, has substantial control over us, including over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, and his interests, along with the interests of our other Continuing Equity Owners, in our business may conflict with yours.\u201d\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to certain exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, any director or our officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or\n(iv) any action asserting a claim against us, any director or our officers or employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock are deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our Class A common stock, which could depress the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors will have the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our Class A common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our Class A common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A common stock.\nMaterial weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could have a significant adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock.\nIn the past we have identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. In future periods, if additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified, we may be required to restate our financial statements and could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, a loss of public and investor confidence, and to litigation from investors and stockholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to manage our business effectively or accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our common stock price and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the NYSE or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, and our tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u25cf expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u25cf tax effects of equity-based compensation;\n\u25cf costs related to intercompany restructurings; or\n\u25cf changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur Class A common stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nVolatility in the market price of our Class A common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for such shares. Many factors, which are outside our control, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate significantly, including those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and this Form 10-K, as well as the following:\n\u25cf our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u25cf our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations;\n\u25cf conditions that impact demand for our services;\n\u25cf future announcements concerning our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses;\n\u25cf the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf the size of our public float;\n\u25cf coverage by or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations;\n\u25cf market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u25cf strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u25cf changes in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf changes in senior management or key personnel;\n\u25cf issuances, exchanges or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges or sales of our capital stock;\n\u25cf changes in our dividend policy;\n\u25cf adverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us; and\n\u25cf changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war and responses to such events.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our company, or if they issue unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our Class A common stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that third-party securities analysts publish about our company and our industry. If one or more analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market. In addition, one or more of these analysts could downgrade our Class A common stock or issue other negative commentary about our company or our industry. As a result of one or more of these factors, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.", "PERMNO": 16437, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "CWH"}
