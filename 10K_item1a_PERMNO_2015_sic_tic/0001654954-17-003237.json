{"cik": "1140102", "company": "Command Center, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur common stock value and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to those set forth below. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our common stock, business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. These risk factors should be carefully considered together with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the risks and uncertainties described under the heading \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d If any of the events described in the risk factors below actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer significantly. In such case, the value of your investment could decline and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock.\nOur business is impacted by fluctuations in the general economy. The staffing needs of our customers vary greatly with the overall condition of the economy. While general economic conditions appear to be improving, the changes are gradual, and many customers are limiting and may continue to limit their spending on the services we provide, which could limit our growth or cause a reduction in our sales, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial and operating performance. Deterioration of general economic conditions could have an adverse material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are vulnerable to downturns in regional and local economies. As of March 30, 2017, we own and operate 65 stores located across 21 states. As such, we are subject to regional and local economic conditions in many markets. Additionally, our new stores are sometimes placed in metropolitan areas where we have one or more existing stores, increasing our exposure to future economic weakness in those local areas. Deterioration in regional and local economic conditions in the areas in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSeasonal fluctuations in demand for the services of our temporary workers in certain markets may adversely affect our revenue and financial performance in the fall and winter months. Revenues generated from stores in markets subject to seasonal fluctuations will be less stable and may be lower than in other markets. Locating stores in highly seasonal markets involves higher risks. Our individual store revenue can fluctuate significantly on both a quarter over quarter and year over year basis depending on the local economic conditions and need for temporary labor services in the local economy. One of our goals is to increase the diversity of clients and industries we service at both the store and the company level. We believe this will reduce the potential negative impact of an economic downturn in any one industry or region. To the extent that we consider the opening of new stores, we intend to select store locations with a view to maximizing total long-term return on our investment in stores, personnel, marketing and other fixed and sunk costs. However, there can be no assurance that our profitability will not be adversely affected by low returns on investment in certain highly seasonal markets. Weather can also have a significant impact on our operations.\nThe market for our common stock is limited and our shareholders may have difficulty reselling their shares when desired or at attractive market prices. Our stock price and our listing may make it more difficult for our shareholders to resell shares when desired or at attractive prices. Our Company stock trades on the \u201cover-the-counter\u201d market and is listed on OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets. Our common stock has continued to trade in low volumes and at low prices. Some investors view low-priced stocks as unduly speculative and therefore not appropriate candidates for investment. Many brokerage firms and institutional investors have internal policies prohibiting the purchase or maintenance of positions in low-priced stocks.\n\u201cPenny stock\u201d rules may make buying or selling our securities difficult which may make our stock less liquid and make it harder for investors to buy and sell our shares. Trading in our securities is subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules and it is anticipated that trading in our securities will continue to be subject to the penny stock rules for the foreseeable future. The SEC has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules require that any broker-dealer who recommends our securities to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors must, prior to the sale, make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to execute the transaction. Unless an exception is available, the regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market. In addition, broker-dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements may discourage broker-dealers from recommending transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the liquidity of our securities and consequently adversely affect the market price for our securities.\nOur inability to attract, develop and retain qualified store managers and business development specialists may negatively affect our business. We rely significantly on the performance and productivity of our store managers and our staff of business development specialists to help drive new business to our growing number of stores. Each store manager has primary responsibility for managing the operations of the individual on-demand labor store, including recruiting workers, daily dispatch of personnel, and collection of accounts receivable. In addition, each store manager has responsibility for customer service. To combat a typically high turnover rate for store managers in the on-demand labor industry, we have developed and continue to develop and refine training and compensation plans directed at employee retention. There can be no assurance that our training and compensation plans will reduce turnover in this position.\nLoss of key personnel could negatively affect our business. The loss of any key executive could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future performance also depends on our ability to identify, recruit, motivate, and retain key management personnel. The failure to attract and retain key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to find a reliable pool of temporary personnel, we may be unable to meet customer demand and our business may be adversely affected. All on-demand labor companies must continually attract reliable temporary workers to meet customer needs. We compete for such workers with other temporary labor businesses, as well as actual and potential customers, some of which seek to fill positions directly with either regular or temporary employees. In addition, our temporary workers sometimes become regular employees of our customers. From time to time, during peak periods and/or in certain geographic regions, we may experience shortages of available temporary workers. Unavailability of reliable temporary workers will have a negative effect on our results of operations. Use of temporary employees also is affected by other factors beyond our control that may increase the cost of temporary personnel, such as increases in mandated levels of benefits and wages payable to temporary employees. These economic and other factors could reduce demand for our services and lead to lower revenues.\nWe are dependent upon the availability of workers' compensation insurance coverage. We maintain workers' compensation insurance as required by state laws. Very few insurance carriers provide workers' compensation coverage for staffing companies in the manual labor market. We expect the insurance market to tighten even further in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain adequate levels of insurance in the future with acceptable terms, coverages, deductibles and collateral requirements, or at all. In most of the states in which we operate, we cannot engage in business without workers' compensation insurance. In order to obtain coverage we are required to post collateral with the carrier in the form of cash or a letter of credit from our lender. The carrier can retain this collateral for extended periods of time, and increase the amount of such collateral.\nIf we do not manage our workers\u2019 compensation claims well, increased premiums could negatively affect operating results. Workers\u2019 compensation expenses and the related liability accrual are based on our actual claims experience. Currently, and throughout most of our corporate history, we maintained large deductible workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies. Our current workers\u2019 compensation policy has a deductible limit of $500,000 per incident and our workers\u2019 compensation policies prior to April 2014 have a deductible limit of $350,000 per claim. In the years prior to April 2011, our policies have a deductible limit of $250,000 per person. As a result, we are substantially self-insured. Our management training and safety programs attempt to minimize both the frequency and severity of workers\u2019 compensation insurance claims, but a large number of claims or a small number of significant claims could require payment of substantial benefits. In Washington and North Dakota, where private insurance is not allowed or not available, we purchase our insurance through state workers\u2019 compensation funds and our liability in those monopolistic states is limited to payment of the insurance premiums. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully limit the frequency and severity of our workers\u2019 compensation claims or that our insurance premiums and costs will not increase substantially. Higher costs for workers\u2019 compensation coverage, if incurred, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to recover collateral deposits we have placed with our workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. Historically our workers\u2019 compensation insurance carriers have required collateral deposits to secure our payment of claims up to the amount of our policy deductible. For the two-year period prior to April 1, 2014, Dallas National Insurance (now known as Freestone Insurance) provided our workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage under a high deductible policy. Under the terms of the policy we were required to provide cash collateral of $1.8 million as security for payment of claims up to the policy deductible. We are responsible for paying claims up to the deductible amount. In January 2014, Freestone Insurance confirmed to us that it continued to hold $1.8 million of Command Center\u2019s funds as collateral. In April 2014, the State of Delaware placed Freestone Insurance in receivership due to concerns about Freestone\u2019s financial condition. In August 2014, the receivership was converted into a liquidation proceeding. In late 2015, we filed timely proofs of claim with the receiver for return of our collateral deposits, one as a priority claim and one as a general claim. On July 5, 2016, the receiver filed a first accounting with the Delaware Court of Chancery. Pursuant to this accounting, the receiver reported cash and cash equivalents of $87.7 million as of December 31, 2015. We believe our claim for return of collateral will be a priority claim and our collateral will be returned to us. However, if the Receiver determines that our claim for return of collateral is not entitled to priority or, if there are not sufficient assets available to pay all of the priority claims, we may not receive any or all of our collateral. As a result of the developments, in the second quarters of each 2015 and 2016 we recorded a reserve of $250,000 on the deposit balance, for a total reserve of $500,000, for potential loss of the value of our collateral held by Freestone. The have of our collateral could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. There have been no recent communications from the receiver.\nWe are exposed to substantial pressure on working capital due to the delay between the time we pay our temporary workers and the time we collect from our customers, which requires aggressive management of our credit risk. The pressure on our working capital requires that we manage the resulting credit risk. The magnitude of the risk varies with general economic conditions. We believe that write-offs for doubtful accounts can be maintained at commercially acceptable levels without the need to resort to credit management practices that are unduly intrusive for our customers and interfere with customer acquisition and retention. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that our ability to achieve and sustain profitable operations will not be adversely affected by losses from doubtful accounts or customer relations problems arising from our efforts to manage credit risk.\nWe require debt financing to provide working capital due to the delay between when we pay our temporary workers and other creditors from when we collect from our customers. Field team members are typically paid on the same day the services are performed, while customers are generally billed on a weekly basis with 30-day payment terms. We currently have an account purchase agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. that allows us to sell eligible accounts receivable for 90% of the invoiced amount on a full recourse basis up to the facility maximum or $14 million. When the receivable is collected, the remaining 10% is paid to us, less applicable fees and interest. The term of the agreement is through April 7, 2018. The cancelation of the account purchase agreement would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, and results of operations.\nThe limitations in our receivables financing agreements negatively impact our liquidity. Under our account purchase agreement with our lender, our borrowing base is limited to the lesser of: (1) 90% of acceptable accounts as defined in the agreement, or (2) $14,000,000. Our collateral requirements with our workers' compensation insurance carrier are secured by a $5.7 million letter of credit from our lender. The amount of the letter of credit result in a reduction to our borrowing base, currently reducing funds otherwise available to us by $5.7 million. This limitation on our liquidity may result in our inability to expand or to sustain our operations, which could result in a material adverse impact on our business.\nIncreased employee expenses could adversely affect our operations. We are required to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to employment, including verification of eligibility for employment, occupational safety and health provisions, wage and hour requirements, employment insurance and laws relating to equal opportunity employment. Costs and expenses related to these requirements are a significant operating expense and may increase as a result of, among other things, changes in federal or state laws or regulations requiring employers to provide specified benefits to employees (such as health insurance), increases in the minimum wage or the level of existing benefits, or the lengthening of periods for which unemployment benefits are available. We cannot assure that we will be able to increase fees charged to our customers to offset any increased costs and expenses, and higher costs will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe will continue to be impacted by new laws and regulations relating to employment. In addition to federal and state laws and regulations, many counties and cities have become active in regulating various aspects of employment, including minimum wages, paid sick leave, application forms and background checks, and required notices to employees, among others. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Labor has enacted regulations which, if implemented, will greatly restrict the availability of exemptions from overtime compensation. As a staffing company and large employer with a wide geographical footprint, we are often faced with new legal requirements. Although we believe that we will be able to maintain appropriate compliance procedures, there is no assurance that our efforts will always be timely or effective, or that we will be able to recover the increased cost of new legal requirements through timely pricing increases to our customers.\nWe may incur additional costs and regulatory risks relating to new laws regulating the hiring of undocumented workers. In addition to federal laws, the statutes of several states regulate employer practices relating to the identification and eligibility to work of new hires. We have implemented procedures intended to meet all of these requirements. We process information on each new applicant for employment through the federal government\u2019s E-Verify system. Although we believe that we are in compliance and we will be able to maintain appropriate procedures, we cannot assure that our compliance will not be flawed or delayed because of the large number of temporary personnel that we employ. In some cases, the penalties for noncompliance are punitive. Regulatory requirements imposed on employers and enforcement actions relating to immigration status of employees are expected to increase. If we are not able to maintain appropriate compliance procedures, our operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe will incur additional costs and regulatory risks relating to the impact of health care reform upon our business and failure to comply with such rules and regulations could materially harm our business. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cHealth Care Reform Laws\u201d) include various health-related provisions that took effect in 2015 and 2016, including the requirement that most individuals have health insurance and establishing new regulations on health plans. Although the Health Care Reform Laws do not mandate that employers offer health insurance, beginning in 2016 tax penalties are assessable on large employers which do not offer health insurance that meets certain affordability or benefit requirements. Providing such additional health insurance benefits to our qualifying temporary workers, or the payment of tax penalties if such coverage is not provided, will increase our costs. The economic impact of the Health Care Reform Laws to us is not yet known. It is likely that the Health Care Reform Laws will be revised or rewritten pursuant to proposed legislation. The requirements and the cost impact of revisions to existing laws, Health Care Reform Laws, or new health care legislation is unknown. Under both the present laws and proposed legislation, if we are unable to raise the rates we charge our customers to cover the costs of these programs, such increases in costs could materially harm our business.\nWe may be exposed to employment-related claims and costs from temporary workers, customers, or third parties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplaces of other businesses. As the employer of record, we are at risk for claims brought by our temporary workers, such as wage and hour claims, discrimination and harassment actions and workers' compensation claims. We are also at risk for liabilities alleged to have been caused by our temporary personnel (such as claims relating to personal injuries, property damage, immigration status, misappropriation of funds or property, violation of environmental laws, or criminal activity). Significant instances of these types of issues will impact our customers\u2019 perception of us and may have a negative effect on our results of operations. The risk is heightened because we do not have control over our customers\u2019 workplace or direct supervision of our temporary workers. If we are found liable for the actions or omissions of our temporary workers or our customers, and adequate insurance coverage is not available, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to increase customer pricing to offset increased costs and may lose volume as a result of price increases we are able to implement. We expect to raise prices for our services in amounts sufficient to offset increased costs of services, operating costs, and cost increases due to inflation, regulatory requirements and to improve our return on invested capital. However, competitive factors may require us to absorb cost increases, which would have a negative effect on our operating margins. Even if we are able to increase costs as desired, we may lose volume to competitors willing to service customers at a lower price.\nWe face competition from companies that have greater resources than we do and we may not be able to effectively compete against these companies. The temporary staffing industry is largely fragmented and highly competitive, with low barriers to entry. A large percentage of on-demand labor companies are small local or regional operations with fewer than five locations. Within local or regional markets, these companies actively compete with us for customers and temporary personnel. There are also several very large full-service and specialized temporary labor companies competing in national, regional and local markets. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Price competition in the staffing industry is intense and we expect this level of competition to remain high and even increase in the future. Competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is also a risk that competitors, perceiving our lack of capital resources, may undercut our prices or increase promotional expenditures in our strongest markets in an effort to force us out of business.\nImproper disclosure of employee and customer data could result in liabilities and harm our reputation. In the course of our business, we collect, store, use, and transmit information about our employees and customers. Protecting the privacy of this information is critical to our business. We have established a system of controls for safeguarding the security and privacy of our data. Our security controls may not, in every case, be adequate to prevent unauthorized internal or external intrusions into our systems and improper disclosure of personal data and confidential information relating to our employees, our customers or our business. The regulations relating to the security and privacy of information are increasingly prevalent and demanding. The failure to adequately protect private information could expose us to claims from employees and customers and to regulatory actions, could harm our reputation, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or employee concerns may cause higher operating expenses.\nCyberattacks or other breaches of our technology hardware and software, as well as risks associated with compliance and data privacy could have an adverse effect on our systems, our service to our customers, our reputation, our competitive position, and financial results. Our ability to manage our operations successfully is critical to our success. Our business is reliant on our ability to electronically gather, compile, process, store and distribute data and other information. Unintended interruptions or failures resulting from computer and telecommunications failures, equipment or software malfunction, power outages, catastrophic events, security breaches (such as unauthorized access by hackers), social engineering schemes, unauthorized access, errors in usage by our employees, computer viruses, ransomware or malware and other events could harm our business. While we have taken measures to minimize the impact of these problems, the proper functioning of these systems is critical to our business operations. Any security breach or failure in our computer equipment, systems or data could result in the interruption of our business operations, tarnish our reputation and expose us to damages and litigation.\nOur directors, officers and current principal shareholders own a large percentage of our common stock and could limit your influence over corporate decisions. As of March 30, 2017, our directors, officers and current shareholders holding more than 5% of our common stock collectively beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 33% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these shareholders, if they act together, may be able to control most matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. The interests of these shareholders may not always coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of our other shareholders, and they may act in a manner with which you may not agree or that may not be in the best interests of our other shareholders.\nWe will likely be party, from time to time, to various legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We anticipate that, based upon our business plan, disputes will arise in the future relating to contract, employment, labor relations, and other matters that could result in litigation or require arbitration to resolve, which could divert the attention of our management team and could result in costly or unfavorable outcomes for us. Any such litigation could result in substantial expense, could reduce our profits and harm our reputation, and could have a materially adverse impact on our business and financial condition. See Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities that exceed our estimates. We are subject to federal taxes and a multitude of state and local taxes in the United States. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could materially harm our business.\nOur customer contracts contain termination provisions that could decrease our future revenues and earnings. Most of our customer contracts can be terminated by the customer on short notice without penalty. Our customers are, therefore, not contractually obligated to continue to do business with us in the future. This creates uncertainty with respect to the revenues and earnings we may recognize with respect to our customer contracts.\nWe have a history of net losses. Although we have recorded a net profit in each of the last six fiscal years, as of December 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $37.6 million. We have incurred net losses in many of our fiscal years since inception. We may incur additional operating losses. We make no assurance that our revenue will increase or that we will be profitable in any future period.\nIf our goodwill is impaired, we will record an additional non-cash charge to our results of operations and the amount of the charge may be material. At least annually, or whenever events or circumstances arise indicating impairment may exist, we review goodwill for impairment as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). In 2014, we wrote-off approximately $807,000 in goodwill relating to our 2012 acquisition of DR Services. In addition, on June 3, 2016, we purchased substantially all of the assets of Hanwood Arkansas, LLC, an Arkansas limited liability company, and Hanwood Oklahoma, LLC, an Oklahoma limited liability company. Together these companies operated as Hancock Staffing (\u201cHancock\u201d) from stores located in Little Rock, Arkansas and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In connection with the acquisition of Hancock, we identified and recognized $1.3 million in goodwill that we added to the carrying amount of $2.5 million from the acquisition of DR Services after the write-off. The resulting carrying amount of $3.8 million could change if there are future changes in our capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, ability to perform at levels that were forecasted, or a permanent change to our market capitalization. In the future, we may need to further reduce the carrying amount of goodwill by taking an additional non-cash charge to our results of operations. Such a charge would have the effect of reducing goodwill with a corresponding impairment expense and may have a material effect upon our reported results. The additional expense may reduce our reported profitability or increase our reported losses in future periods and could negatively affect the market for our securities, our ability to obtain other sources of capital, and may generally have a negative effect on our future operations.", "PERMNO": 17875, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "HQI"}
