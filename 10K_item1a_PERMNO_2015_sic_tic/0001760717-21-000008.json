Please be aware that additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial could also materially and adversely affect our business operations. You should also refer to the other information contained in our periodic reports, including the Forward-Looking Statements section, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our business. Except where the context otherwise indicates, references below to the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cours\u201d and \u201cus\u201d include all of our subsidiaries.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of some of the risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\u2022The recent COVID-19 pandemic and similar health epidemics, contagious disease outbreaks and public perception thereof, could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\n\u2022Our growth depends on our ability to attract and retain players, and the loss of our players, or failure to attract new players, could materially and adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We rely on third-party platforms to make our games available to players and to collect revenue.\n\u2022A small number of games has generated a majority of our revenue, and we must continue to launch and enhance games that attract and retain a significant number of paying players in order to grow our revenue and sustain our competitive position. We rely on a small percentage of our players for nearly all of our revenue.\n\u2022Our success depends upon our ability to adapt to, and offer games that keep pace with, changing technology and evolving industry standards.\n\u2022We operate in a highly competitive industry, and our success depends on our ability to effectively compete.\n\u2022The Revolver we entered into in connection with the IPO imposes certain restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our business and make payments on our indebtedness.\n\u2022We rely on skilled employees with creative and technical backgrounds.\nRisks Related to Our Technology\n\u2022We rely on the ability to use the intellectual property rights of Scientific Games and other third parties, including the third-party intellectual property rights licensed to Scientific Games that we have enjoyed as an indirect subsidiary of Scientific Games, and we may lose the benefit of any intellectual property owned by or licensed to Scientific Games if it ceases to hold certain minimum percentages of the voting power in our company.\n\u2022The intellectual property rights of others may prevent us from developing new games, entering new markets or may expose us to liability or costly litigation.\n\u2022Our success depends on the security and integrity of the games we offer, and security breaches or other disruptions could compromise our information or the information of our players and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\n\u2022If we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches, we could suffer a loss of sales and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm, regulatory fines or punishment and other negative consequences.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Factors\n\u2022Legal or regulatory restrictions could adversely impact our business and limit the growth of our operations. We may share part of the regulatory burdens of our parent, Scientific Games.\n\u2022Data privacy and security laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business could increase the cost of our operations and subject us to possible sanctions and other penalties. Our business depends on the protection of our proprietary information and our owned and licensed intellectual property.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Scientific Games\n\u2022Scientific Games controls the direction of our business, and the concentrated ownership of our common stock will prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant decisions.\n\u2022If Scientific Games causes the SG Members to sell a controlling interest in our company to a third party in a private transaction, holders of our Class A common stock may not realize any change-of-control premium on shares of our Class A common stock, and we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party.\n\u2022Scientific Games\u2019 interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of our stockholders. Conflicts of interest between Scientific Games and us could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us and our public stockholders.\n\u2022Our articles of incorporation limit Scientific Games\u2019 and its directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty and could also prevent us from benefiting from corporate opportunities that might otherwise have been available to us.\n\u2022Third parties may seek to hold us responsible for liabilities of Scientific Games, which could result in a decrease in our income.\n\u2022We are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\n\u2022We rely on our access to Scientific Games\u2019 brands and reputation, some of Scientific Games\u2019 relationships, and the brands and reputations of unaffiliated third parties.\n\u2022The services that we receive from Scientific Games may not be sufficient for us to operate our business, and we would likely incur significant incremental costs if we lost access to Scientific Games\u2019 services.\n\u2022Our historical financial results are not necessarily representative of the results we have or may achieve as a standalone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure and the TRA\n\u2022Our sole material asset is our interest in SciPlay Parent LLC, and, accordingly, we depend on distributions from SciPlay Parent LLC to pay our taxes and expenses, including payments under the TRA. SciPlay Parent LLC\u2019s ability to make such distributions have been and may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.\n\u2022The TRA with the SG Members requires us to make cash payments to the SG Members in respect of certain tax benefits to which we may become entitled, and the payments we are required to make have been and will be substantial.\n\u2022In certain cases, future payments under the TRA to the SG Members may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA.\n\u2022We will not be reimbursed for any payments made to the SG Members under the TRA in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\n\u2022We are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\n\u2022The dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our Class A common stock or may dilute our stockholders\u2019 economic interest in SciPlay.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating us and our Class A common stock. The risk factors generally have been separated into seven groups: risks related to our business and industry, risks relating to our technology, risks related to legal and regulatory factors, risks related to our relationship with Scientific Games, risks related to our organizational structure and the TRA, risks related to ownership of our Class A Common Stock and general risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe recent COVID-19 pandemic and similar health epidemics, contagious disease outbreaks and public perception thereof, could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe recent outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, and public perception thereof, have contributed to consumer unease and may lead to decreased discretionary spending, which may have a negative effect on us. Other future health epidemics or contagious disease outbreaks could do the same. We cannot predict the ultimate effects that the outbreak of COVID-19, any resulting social, political and economic conditions and decrease in discretionary spending may have on us, as they would be expected to impact our consumers and business partners in varied ways in different communities. Our revenue is driven by players\u2019 disposable incomes and level of social casino gaming activity. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has led to economic and financial uncertainty for many consumers and may reduce the disposable incomes of social casino game players resulting in a lower number of players purchasing coins, chips or cards, or in players purchasing fewer coins, chips or cards, which would negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The extent to which we are able to sustain the increased player engagement that we experienced during the first half of 2020 as a result of the stay at home measures across the U.S. is uncertain, as player engagement has already and may continue to recede. The recession of player engagement, as a result of the discontinuation of stay at home measures or otherwise, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, this outbreak of COVID-19 has caused, and may continue to cause us and certain of our business partners, including Scientific Games, who provides services to us under the Intercompany Service Agreement, to implement temporary adjustment of work schemes allowing employees to work from home and collaborate remotely. We have taken measures to monitor and reduce the impact of the outbreak, including putting in place a global crisis monitoring team, protocols for responding when employees are infected and enhanced cleaning procedures at all sites but there can be no assurance these will be sufficient to mitigate the risks faced by our and our partners\u2019 work forces. We may experience lower work efficiency and productivity, which may adversely affect our service quality, and our business operations have been and could be disrupted when and/or if our employees have been or are suspected of infection, since this has caused and may cause our employees to be quarantined and/or our offices to be temporarily shut down. In addition, as we have reopened our offices following appropriate precautions and guidelines, the risk of spreading the virus could increase and we may experience further disruptions to our business operations if our employees contract the virus from each other. We will continue to incur costs for our operations, and our revenues during this period are difficult to predict. As a result of any of the above developments, our business has been and our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The extent to which this outbreak impacts our results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity and duration of this outbreak and the actions taken by governmental authorities and us to contain it or treat its impact.\nOur growth depends on our ability to attract and retain players, and the loss of our players, or failure to attract new players, could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to achieve growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, upon our ability to attract new players to our games, and retain existing players of our games. Achieving growth in our community of players may require us to increasingly engage in sophisticated and costly sales and marketing efforts that may not result in additional players.\nIn addition, our ability to increase the number of players of our games will depend on continued player adoption of social casino gaming and other forms of casual gaming. Growth in the social gaming industry and the level of demand for and\nmarket acceptance of our games are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We cannot assure that player adoption of social gaming and our games will continue or exceed current growth rates, or that the industry will achieve more widespread acceptance.\nAdditionally, as technological or regulatory standards change and we modify our technology platform to comply with those standards, we may need players to take certain actions to continue playing, such as downloading a new game client, performing age gating checks or accepting new privacy policies or terms and conditions. Players may stop using our games and related services at any time, including if the quality of the player experience on our platform, including our support capabilities in the event of a problem, does not meet their expectations or keep pace with the quality of the player experience generally offered by competitive games and services. In addition, expenditures by players tend to fluctuate seasonally, particularly during the summer months, and may reflect overall economic conditions.\nWe face competition for leisure time, attention and discretionary spending of our players. Other forms of leisure time activities, such as offline, traditional online, personal computer and console games, television, movies, sports and the internet, are much larger and more well-established options for consumers. Consumer tastes and preferences for leisure time activities are also subject to sudden or unpredictable change on account of new innovations. If consumers do not find our games to be compelling or if other existing or new leisure time activities are perceived by our players to offer greater variety, affordability, interactivity and overall enjoyment, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party platforms to make our games available to players and to collect revenue.\nOur social gaming offerings operate through Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon, which also serve as significant online distribution platforms for our games, with some of our games available on Microsoft. Substantially all of our revenue was generated by players using those platforms.\nConsequently, our expansion and prospects depend on our continued relationships with these providers, and any emerging platform providers that are widely adopted by our target player base. We are subject to the standard terms and conditions that these platform providers have for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of games and other applications on their platforms, and which the platform providers can change unilaterally on short or without notice. Our business would be harmed if:\n\u2022the platform providers discontinue or limit our access to their platforms;\n\u2022governments or private parties, such as internet providers, impose bandwidth restrictions or increase charges or restrict or prohibit access to those platforms;\n\u2022the platforms decline in popularity;\n\u2022the platforms modify their current discovery mechanisms, communication channels available to developers, respective terms of service or other policies, including fees;\n\u2022the platforms impose restrictions or make it more difficult for players to buy coins, chips or cards; or\n\u2022the platforms change how the personal information of players is made available to developers or develop their own competitive offerings.\nIf alternative platforms increase in popularity, we could be adversely impacted if we fail to create compatible versions of our games in a timely manner, or if we fail to establish a relationship with such alternative platforms. Likewise, if our platform providers alter their operating platforms, we could be adversely impacted as our offerings may not be compatible with the altered platforms or may require significant and costly modifications in order to become compatible. If our platform providers were to develop competitive offerings, either on their own or in cooperation with one or more competitors, our growth prospects could be negatively impacted. If our platform providers do not perform their obligations in accordance with our platform agreements, we could be adversely impacted.\nIn the past, some of these platform providers have been unavailable for short periods of time or experienced issues with their features that permit our players to purchase coins, chips or cards. For example, in the second and third quarters of 2018, we were negatively impacted by data privacy protection changes implemented by Facebook, which impaired our players\u2019 ability to access their previously acquired coins, chips or cards and purchase additional coins, chips or cards. If similar events recur on a prolonged basis or other similar issues arise that impact players\u2019 ability to download our games,\naccess social features or purchase coins, chips or cards, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, operating results and brand.\nA small number of games has generated a majority of our revenue, and we must continue to launch and enhance games that attract and retain a significant number of paying players in order to grow our revenue and sustain our competitive position.\nHistorically, we have depended on a small number of games for a majority of our revenue, and we expect that this dependency will continue for the foreseeable future. In particular, Jackpot Party Casino has accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue since its launch in 2012, including 44% of our revenue in 2018, 48% of our revenue in 2019, and 52% of our revenue in 2020, and we expect it to continue to do so over the next several years. Our growth depends on our ability to consistently launch new games that achieve significant popularity. Each of our games generally requires significant research and development, engineering, marketing and other resources to develop, launch and sustain via regular upgrades and expansions, and such costs on average have increased. In the future, we may be forced to reduce our research and development and marketing expenses in order to support other business priorities, which would harm our ability to attract new players and expand our player base and game community. Our ability to successfully and timely launch, sustain and expand games and attract and retain paying players largely depends on our ability to:\n\u2022anticipate and effectively respond to changing game player interests and preferences;\n\u2022anticipate or respond to changes in the competitive landscape;\n\u2022develop, sustain and expand games that are fun, interesting and compelling to play and on which players want to spend money;\n\u2022retain rights to the intellectual property rights of third parties, including Scientific Games;\n\u2022build and maintain our brand and reputation;\n\u2022effectively market new games and enhancements to our existing players and new players;\n\u2022minimize launch delays and cost overruns on new games and game expansions;\n\u2022minimize downtime and other technical difficulties; and\n\u2022acquire high-quality assets, personnel and companies.\nIt is difficult to consistently anticipate player demand on a large scale, particularly as we develop new games in new markets, including the international markets and new mobile platforms. If we do not successfully launch games that attract and retain a significant number of paying players and extend the life of our existing games, our market share, reputation and financial results could be harmed. In addition, if the popularity of Jackpot Party Casino or any of our other top games decreases significantly, that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nMoreover, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in innovating and introducing new games, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of our games and services. Under the IP License Agreement, our right to use any intellectual property created or acquired by SG Gaming, Inc. (formerly known as Bally Gaming, Inc.) (\u201cSG Gaming\u201d) or its affiliates, or licensed by third parties to SG Gaming, after the third anniversary of the date of the IP License Agreement, will be limited to use in our currently available games. This limit will also extend to derivative works of, or improvements to, intellectual property licensed to us under the IP License Agreement that are developed after the third anniversary of the date of the IP License Agreement (including by us), as such derivative works and improvements will be assigned to SG Gaming and licensed back to us pursuant to the terms of the IP License Agreement. We cannot assure that we will be able to obtain a license for the use of any such intellectual property in our new games on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe cannot assure that our initiatives to improve our player experience will always be successful. We also cannot predict whether our new games or service offerings will be well received by players, or whether improving our technology will be successful or sufficient to offset the costs incurred to develop and market these games, services or technology.\nWe rely on a small percentage of our players for nearly all of our revenue.\nA small percentage of our players account for nearly all of our revenue. For example, 5.5%, 6.0% and 7.1% of our players made purchases in our games, in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. However, we lose paying players in the ordinary course of business, and they may stop making purchases in our games or playing our games altogether at any time. In order to sustain or increase our revenue levels, we must attract new paying players or increase the amount our players pay. To retain paying players, we must devote significant resources so that the games they play retain their interest and attract them to our other games. Our new games may also attract players away from our existing games. If we fail to grow or sustain the number of our paying players, or if the rate at which we add paying players declines or if the average amount our paying players pay declines, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nOur success depends upon our ability to adapt to, and offer games that keep pace with, changing technology and evolving industry standards.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract and retain players, which is largely driven by maintaining and increasing the quantity and quality of social games. To satisfy players, we need to continue to improve their experience and innovate and introduce games that players find useful and that cause them to return to our suite of games more frequently. This includes continuing to improve our technology to optimize search results for our games, tailoring our game offerings to additional geographic and market segments, and improving the user-friendliness of our games and our ability to provide high-quality support. Our ability to anticipate or respond to changing technology and evolving industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced games on a timely basis or at all is a significant factor affecting our ability to remain competitive and expand and attract new players. We cannot assure that we will achieve the necessary technological advances or have the financial resources needed to introduce new games on a timely basis or at all.\nOur players depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our games. Our ability to provide effective support is largely dependent on our ability to attract, resource, and retain employees who are not only qualified to support players of our games, but are also well versed in our games. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell coins, chips or cards within our games to existing and prospective players, and could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and our success depends on our ability to effectively compete.\nSocial gaming, which includes social casino gaming and from which we derive substantially all of our revenue, is a rapidly evolving industry with low barriers to entry. Businesses can easily launch online or mobile platforms and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software or partnering with various established companies in these markets. The market for our games is also characterized by rapid technological developments, frequent launches of new games, changes in player needs and behavior, disruption by innovative entrants and evolving business models and industry standards. As a result, our industry is constantly changing games and business models in order to adopt and optimize new technologies, increase cost efficiency and adapt to player preferences.\nSuccessful execution of our strategy depends on our continuous ability to attract and retain players, adapt to the emergence of new mobile hardware or operating systems, expand the market for our games, maintain a technological edge and offer new capabilities to players. We also compete with social gaming companies, including those that offer social casino games such as Playtika, Zynga, DoubleU and others, that have no connection to regulated real money gaming, and many of those companies have a base of existing players that is larger than ours. In some cases, we compete against real money gaming operators who have expanded their games to include social casino games and have in the past leveraged their land-based gaming relationship with Scientific Games to license social casino game content from Scientific Games, although such rights are limited in scope by the IP License Agreement. In those cases, customers of such real money gaming operators may choose to play our content as it is offered by the operator and not as it is offered by our social casino games, detrimentally impacting our results.\nSome of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, local language capabilities, greater financial, technical, and other resources and, in some cases, the ability to rapidly combine online platforms with traditional staffing and contingent worker solutions. These companies may use these advantages to develop different platforms and services to compete with our games, spend more on advertising and brand marketing, invest more in research and development or respond more quickly and effectively than we\ndo to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, regulatory conditions or player preferences or requirements. As a result, our players may decide to stop playing our games or switch to our competitors\u2019 games.\nMoreover, current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others, including our current or future third-party suppliers. By doing so, these competitors may increase their ability to meet the needs of existing or prospective freelancers and players. These developments could limit our ability to obtain revenue from existing and new buyers. If we are unable to compete effectively, successfully and at reasonable cost against our existing and future competitors, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nWe offer players regular free play and frequent discounts for purchases of coins, chips or cards to extend play in connection with our business. We cannot assure that competitive pressure will not cause us to increase the incentives that we offer to our players, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur free-to-play business model depends on the optional purchases of coins, chips or cards to supplement the availability of periodically offered free coins, chips or cards.\nWe derive nearly all of our revenue from the sale of coins, chips or cards used to play our games. Our games are available to players for free, and we generally generate revenue from them only if they voluntarily purchase coins, chips or cards above and beyond the level of free coins, chips or cards provided periodically as part of the game. If we fail to offer games that attract purchases of coins, chips or cards, or if we fail to properly manage the economics of free versus paid coins, chips or cards, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Revolver we entered into in connection with the IPO imposes certain restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our business and make payments on our indebtedness.\nIn connection with the IPO, we entered into a $150.0 million revolving credit agreement (the \u201cRevolver\u201d), which contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness; incur liens; sell, transfer or dispose of property and assets; invest; make dividends or distributions or other restricted payments and engage in affiliate transactions. In addition, we are required to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio not to exceed 2.50:1.00 and to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 4.00:1.00. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity, Capital Resources and Working Capital-Revolving Credit Facility\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. The Revolver limits our ability to make certain payments, including dividends or distributions on SciPlay Parent LLC\u2019s equity and other restricted payments, provided, however, that payments in respect of certain tax distributions under the Operating Agreement and certain payments under the TRA are permitted, and payments to SciPlay Parent LLC\u2019s direct or indirect parent made on or prior to the closing date of the Revolver in an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds of the IPO are permitted, among other customary exceptions.\nMoreover, the new Revolver requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to interest payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic, industry or competitive developments or conditions; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate or in pursuing our strategic objectives.\nWe may be exposed to the risk of increased interest rates.\nThe Revolver has variable rates of interest, some of which use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity, Capital Resources and Working Capital-Revolving Credit Facility\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In addition, other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt, and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may in the future pursue amendments to the credit agreement governing the Revolver to provide for a transition mechanism or other reference rate in anticipation of LIBOR\u2019s discontinuation, but we may not be able to reach agreement with our lenders on any such amendments. As a result, additional\nfinancing to replace any of our LIBOR-based debt may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support business growth, and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nBased on our current plans and market conditions, we believe that cash flows generated from our operations, the proceeds from the IPO and borrowing capacity under the Revolver will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements in the ordinary course of business for the foreseeable future. However, we intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new games and features or enhance our existing games, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, personnel and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings in addition to our Revolver to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure in the future could include restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nOur results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors and, therefore, our periodic operating results are not guarantees of future performance.\nOur results of operations can fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. Player activity is generally slower in the second and third quarters of the year, particularly during the summer months. Certain other seasonal trends and factors that may cause our results to fluctuate include:\n\u2022the geographies where we operate;\n\u2022holiday and vacation seasons;\n\u2022climate and weather;\n\u2022economic and political conditions, including conditions related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and government measures to mitigate its effects; and\n\u2022timing of the release of new games.\nIn light of the foregoing, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved in another quarter or for the full fiscal year. We cannot assure that the seasonal trends and other factors that have impacted our historical results will repeat in future periods as we cannot influence or forecast many of these factors.\nWe rely on skilled employees with creative and technical backgrounds.\nWe rely on our highly skilled, technically trained and creative employees to develop new technologies and create innovative games. Such employees, particularly game designers, engineers and project managers with desirable skill sets are in high demand, and we devote significant resources to identifying, hiring, training, successfully integrating and retaining these employees. A lack of skilled technical workers could delay or negatively impact our business plans, ability to compete, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We employ personnel internationally, particularly in game development operations in Israel and Ukraine, and are subject to additional risks customarily associated with foreign operations, such as labor and employment related risks. See also \u201cOur foreign operations expose us to business and legal risks\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.\nRisks Related to Our Technology\nWe rely on the ability to use the intellectual property rights of Scientific Games and other third parties, including the third-party intellectual property rights licensed to Scientific Games that we have enjoyed as an indirect subsidiary of\nScientific Games, and we may lose the benefit of any intellectual property owned by or licensed to Scientific Games if it ceases to hold certain minimum percentages of the voting power in our company.\nSubstantially all of our games rely on products, technologies and other intellectual property that are licensed from Scientific Games and other third parties. Since September 2016, we have been party to an intercompany license agreement with Scientific Games pursuant to which we receive the right to use certain patents, brands, trademarks and other intellectual property owned by or licensed to Scientific Games. In addition, as an indirect subsidiary of Scientific Games, we benefit from intellectual property licensed to Scientific Games for the benefit of it and its subsidiaries. Under the IP License Agreement and as a subsidiary of Scientific Games, we expect, but cannot guarantee, that we will be able to continue to receive those rights on favorable or reasonable terms, and licensors may have approval rights over any future sublicenses by Scientific Games. The IP License Agreement has a change of control provision that requires SG Gaming\u2019s consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, in the event of changes of control of our company that are not initiated by Scientific Games. SG Gaming could reasonably withhold its consent, and therefore have the right to terminate the IP License Agreement, if, for example, a competitor of Scientific Games were to acquire more than 50% of the voting power in our company. If SG Gaming were to exercise this termination right, we would lose the benefit of any intellectual property licensed to us under the IP License Agreement, which is essential to our business, including any intellectual property that we develop, to the extent it is an improvement, enhancement, modification, or derivative work of any intellectual property licensed to us under the IP License Agreement.\nAny transaction that results in Scientific Games ceasing to hold at least 50% of the voting power in our company will be considered a change of control transaction requiring SG Gaming\u2019s consent, except for: (i) transactions initiated by Scientific Games, or (ii) decreases in voting power resulting from (a) Scientific Games selling any ownership interests in our company, either privately or through additional public offerings, or (b) any future issuance of additional shares of our capital stock. In addition, our rights to any third-party intellectual property licensed to SG Gaming or its affiliates and sublicensed to us under the IP License Agreement are subject to any change of control provisions in the applicable third-party license.\nFurther, even absent termination of the IP License Agreement, if Scientific Games ceases to hold at least 50% of the voting power in our company, or such other percentage as may be required by a specific third-party license between the applicable third party and Scientific Games, we may also lose the benefit of any intellectual property licensed to Scientific Games for the benefit of it or its subsidiaries. We have little control over future amendments or renewals of third-party licenses to which we are not a party, and such amendments and renewals may affect the ability of Scientific Games to sublicense such third-party intellectual property rights to us, or our ability to benefit directly from such intellectual property without a sublicense as a subsidiary of Scientific Games.\nThe future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain, retain or expand licenses for technologies and services in a competitive market. We cannot assure that these third-party licenses, including the IP License Agreement, or support for such licensed technologies and services, will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In the event that we lose the benefit of, or cannot renew and/or expand existing licenses, we may be required to discontinue or limit our use of the technologies and services that include or incorporate the licensed intellectual property. In addition, while we are controlled by Scientific Games, we may not have the leverage to negotiate amendments to the IP License Agreement, if required, on terms as favorable to us as those we would negotiate with an unaffiliated third party.\nSome of our license agreements contain minimum guaranteed royalty payments to the third party, and other agreements are sublicenses where such payment obligations are passed on to us by the sublicensor, including under the IP License Agreement. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue to offset the minimum guaranteed royalty payments, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Our license agreements, including both direct licenses and sublicensing arrangements, typically contain customary restrictions on our ability to use or transfer the licensed rights, including in connection with certain strategic transactions, such as a change of control of the licensee. Although we believe that we are complying with our obligations under these license agreements and do not believe them to be in jeopardy of being terminated, we cannot assure that any or all of these license agreements in fact will remain in effect. Under certain of these agreements, the licensor has the right to audit our use of their intellectual property. Disputes with licensors over uses or terms could result in the payment of additional royalties or penalties by us, cancellation or non-renewal of the underlying license or litigation.\nOur business depends on the protection of our proprietary information and our owned and licensed intellectual property.\nWe believe that our success depends, in part, on protecting our owned and licensed intellectual property in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Our intellectual property includes certain trademarks and copyrights relating to our games, and\nproprietary or confidential information that is not subject to formal intellectual property protection. Intellectual property that is significant to our business is owned by Scientific Games and other third parties. Our success may depend, in part, on our and our licensors\u2019 ability to protect the trademarks, trade dress, names, logos or symbols under which we market our games and to obtain and maintain patent, copyright and other intellectual property protection for the technologies, designs, software and innovations used in our games and our business. We cannot assure that we will be able to build and maintain consumer value in our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property protection in our technologies, designs, software and innovations or that any patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property right will provide us with competitive advantages.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowledge. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and independent contractors regarding our trade secrets and proprietary information, but we cannot assure that the obligation to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information will be honored.\nIn the future we may make claims of infringement against third parties, or make claims that third-party intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable. These claims could:\n\u2022cause us to incur greater costs and expenses in the protection of our intellectual property;\n\u2022potentially negatively impact our intellectual property rights, for example, by causing one or more of our intellectual property rights to be ruled or rendered unenforceable or invalid; or\n\u2022divert management\u2019s attention and our resources.\nThe intellectual property rights of others may prevent us from developing new games, entering new markets or may expose us to liability or costly litigation.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continually adapt our games to incorporate new technologies and to expand into markets that may be created by new technologies. If technologies are protected by the intellectual property rights of our competitors or other third parties, we may be prevented from introducing games based on these technologies or expanding into markets created by these technologies.\nWe cannot assure that our business activities and games will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, or that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us. A successful claim of infringement by a third party against us, our games or one of our licensees in connection with the use of our technologies, or an unsuccessful claim of infringement made by us against a third party or its products or games, could adversely affect our business or cause us financial harm. Any such claim and any resulting litigation, should it occur, could:\n\u2022be expensive and time-consuming to defend or require us to pay significant amounts in damages;\n\u2022result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or render our proprietary rights unenforceable;\n\u2022cause us to cease making, licensing or using games that incorporate the intellectual property;\n\u2022require us to redesign, reengineer or rebrand our games or limit our ability to bring new games to the market in the future;\n\u2022require us to enter into costly or burdensome royalty, licensing or settlement agreements in order to obtain the right to use a product or process;\n\u2022impact the commercial viability of the games that are the subject of the claim during the pendency of such claim; or\n\u2022require us to stop selling the infringing games.\nOur success depends on the security and integrity of the games we offer, and security breaches or other disruptions could compromise our information or the information of our players and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe believe that our success depends, in large part, on providing secure games to our players. Our business sometimes involves the storage, processing and transmission of players\u2019 proprietary, confidential and personal information. We also maintain certain other proprietary and confidential information relating to our business and personal information of our personnel. Our games and systems are designed with security features to prevent fraudulent activity. However, we cannot guarantee that these security features will effectively stop all fraudulent activity. Despite our security measures, our games are vulnerable to attacks by hackers, players, vendors or employees or breached due to malfeasance or other disruptions. Any security breach or incident that we experience could result in unauthorized access to, misuse of, or unauthorized acquisition of our or our players\u2019 data, the loss, corruption or alteration of this data, interruptions in our operations, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our players or third-party platforms. Any of these could expose us to claims, litigation, fines and potential liability.\nAn increasing number of online services have disclosed security breaches, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their services. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not foreseeable or recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and brand could be harmed, and we could lose players. Data security breaches and other data security incidents may also result from non-technical means, for example, actions by employees or contractors. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory or other governmental investigations, enforcement actions, and legal and financial exposure, including potential contractual liability that is not always limited to the amounts covered by our insurance. Any such compromise could also result in damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in our security measures. Any of these effects could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur ability to prevent anomalies and monitor and ensure the quality and integrity of our games and software is periodically reviewed and enhanced, but may not be sufficient to prevent future attacks, breaches or disruptions. Similarly, we regularly assess the adequacy of our security systems, including the security of our games and software to protect against any material loss to any of our players and the integrity of our games to players. However, we cannot assure that our business will not be affected by a security breach.\nIf we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches, we could suffer a loss of sales and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm, regulatory fines or punishment and other negative consequences.\nOur information technology systems and infrastructure are subject to cyber-attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, theft, computer hacking, employee error or malfeasance or other security breaches. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Threats to our information technology systems and infrastructure include:\n\u2022experienced computer programmers and hackers who are able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns or who are able to develop and deploy malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities;\n\u2022security incidents, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced or lost data, human errors or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and the data stored on those systems, and the data of our business partners;\n\u2022third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to us are also a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.\nThe costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or players. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our results of\noperations. Although we have insurance coverage for protecting against damages resulting from cyber-attacks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and we may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations, and government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization and data protection.\nIn addition, the platforms on which we distribute games may encourage, or require, compliance with certain security standards, such as the voluntary cybersecurity framework released by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which consists of controls designed to identify and manage cyber-security risks, and we could be negatively impacted to the extent we are unable to comply with such standards.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems, and any failures in our systems or errors, defects or disruptions in our games could diminish our brand and reputation, subject us to liability and could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results.\nWe rely on information technology systems that are important to the operation of our business, some of which are managed by third parties. These third parties are typically under no obligation to renew agreements and there is no guarantee that we will be able to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. These systems are used to process, transmit and store electronic information, to manage and support our business operations and to maintain internal control over our financial reporting. In addition, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, and regulations. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems, maintaining and upgrading current systems and preventing security breaches. Among other things, our systems are susceptible to damage, outages, disruptions or shutdowns due to fire, floods, power loss, break-ins, cyber-attacks, network penetration, denial of service attacks and similar events. Failures in our systems or unauthorized access to or tampering with our systems and databases could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Any failures in our computer systems or telecommunications services could affect our ability to operate our games or otherwise conduct business.\nA meaningful portion of our game traffic is hosted by third-party data centers, such as Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d). Such third parties provide us with computing and storage capacity, and AWS is under no obligation to renew the agreements related to these services with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one of our data center operators is acquired, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities and we may incur significant costs and possible lengthy service interruptions in connection with doing so, potentially causing harm to our reputation. If a game is unavailable or operates more slowly than anticipated when a player attempts to access it, that player may stop playing the game and be less likely to return to the game.\nPortions of our information technology infrastructure, including those operated by third parties, may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. We have no control over third parties that provide services to us and those parties could suffer problems or make decisions adverse to our business. We have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events. However, such disruptions could materially and adversely impact our ability to deliver games to players and interrupt other processes. If our information systems do not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time, to key decision-makers, the ability to manage our business could be disrupted and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact our ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nSubstantially all of our games rely on data transferred over the internet. Access to the internet in a timely fashion is necessary to provide a satisfactory player experience to the players of our games. Third parties, such as telecommunications companies, could prevent access to the internet or limit the speed of our data transmissions, with or without reason, causing an adverse impact on our player experience that may materially and adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, telecommunications companies may implement certain measures, such as increased cost or restrictions based on the type or amount of data transmitted, that would impact consumers\u2019 ability to access our games, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Furthermore, internet penetration may be adversely affected by difficult global economic conditions or the cancellation of government programs to expand broadband access.\nOur games and other software applications and systems, and the third-party platforms upon which they are made available could contain undetected errors.\nOur games and other software applications and systems, as well as the third-party platforms upon which they are made available, could contain undetected errors that could adversely affect the performance of our games. For example, these errors could prevent the player from making in-app purchases of coins, chips or cards, which could harm our operating results. They could also harm the overall game-playing experience for our players, which could cause players to reduce their playing time or in-game purchases, discontinue playing our games altogether, or not recommend our games to other players. Such errors could also result in our games being non-compliant with applicable laws or create legal liability for us.\nResolving such errors could disrupt our operations, cause us to divert resources from other projects, or harm our operating results.\nSome of our players may obtain coins, chips or cards used in, or otherwise alter the intended game play of, our games through hacking or other unauthorized methods, resulting in a negative impact to our revenue.\nUnauthorized operators may develop \u201chacks\u201d that enable players to alter the intended game play or obtain unfair advantages in our games. For example, although we do not permit the exchange of coins, chips or cards between accounts or with third parties, it is possible that unauthorized operators could offer \u201chacks\u201d that allow players to obtain coins, chips or cards through unauthorized methods, potentially having a negative impact on the amount of revenue we collect from players. We could change our business model and allow authorized trading in the future, which could result in additional opportunities for players to obtain coins, chips or cards for use in our games through unauthorized methods.\nAdditionally, unrelated third parties may attempt to scam our players with fake offers for coins, chips or cards or other game benefits. These scams may harm the experience of our players, disrupt the virtual economies of our games and reduce the demand for coins, chips or cards, which may result in increased costs to combat such programs and scams, a loss of revenue from the sale of coins, chips or cards and a loss of players.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Factors\nLegal or regulatory restrictions could adversely impact our business and limit the growth of our operations.\nThere is significant opposition in some jurisdictions to interactive social gaming, including social casino gaming. Some states or countries have anti-gaming groups that specifically target social casino games. Such opposition could lead these jurisdictions to adopt legislation or impose a regulatory framework to govern interactive social gaming or social casino gaming specifically. These could result in a prohibition on interactive social gaming or social casino gaming altogether, restrict our ability to advertise our games, or substantially increase our costs to comply with these regulations, all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing, scope or terms of any such legislation or regulation or the extent to which they may affect our business.\nIn 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided that a social casino game produced by one of our competitors should be considered illegal gambling under Washington state law. Similar lawsuits have been filed against other defendants, including Scientific Games. For example, in April 2018, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in federal district court alleging substantially the same causes of action against our social casino games. In December 2018, the federal district court assigned to the litigation denied Scientific Games\u2019 motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and, in January 2019, Scientific Games filed its answer and affirmative defenses to the putative class action complaint. See \u201cLegal proceedings may materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition\u201d and Note 11.\nIn September 2018, sixteen international gambling regulators, including from Washington State, signed a declaration expressing concern over the blurring of lines between gambling and video game products, including social casino gaming. The regulators analyzed the characteristics of video games and social gaming and the U.K. Parliament published a report on their findings in September 2019. The report addressed the regulators\u2019 findings as to the potential psychosocial and financial harms of immersive technology, the potential usefulness of pattern-of-play data in understanding healthy gameplay and supporting responsible game design. The report found that any gambling-related harms of such games should be addressed through Internet safety legislation. As this report was published by U.K. authorities, we cannot predict the likelihood, timing, scope or terms of any actions taken as a result of the report.\nIn May 2019, the World Health Organization adopted a new edition of its International Classification of Diseases, which lists gaming addiction as a disorder. The American Psychiatric Association (\u201cAPA\u201d) and U.S. regulators have yet to decide whether gaming addiction should be considered a behavioral disorder, but the APA has noted that research and the debate on its classification are ongoing. Certain countries, including China and South Korea, have enacted regulations, such as imposing both gaming curfews and spending limits for minors, and established treatment programs aimed at addressing gaming addiction. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing, scope or terms of any similar regulations in the markets in which we operate, or the extent to which implementation of such regulations may adversely affect our reputation and business.\nConsumer protection and health concerns regarding games such as ours have been raised in the past and may again be raised in the future. Such concerns could lead to increased scrutiny over the manner in which our games are designed, developed, distributed and presented. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing or scope of any concern reaching a level that will impact our business, or whether we would suffer any adverse impacts to our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may share part of the regulatory burdens of our parent, Scientific Games.\nThe majority of our voting power is held by wholly owned subsidiaries of Scientific Games, and we entered into the Intercompany Services Agreement, the IP License Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the TRA with one or more of Scientific Games and its affiliates. Scientific Games and its affiliates hold many privileged licenses in jurisdictions around the world, allowing them to operate as gambling equipment and service suppliers. Regulators that issue such licenses have broad investigative powers and could ask for information from our majority stockholder, the entities from which we license intellectual property and their affiliates. Scientific Games and its affiliates, including SciPlay Parent LLC and its subsidiaries, will be obligated to cooperate with the investigations of such regulators. Such licenses may limit the operations and activities of subsidiaries and affiliates of Scientific Games, including SciPlay Parent LLC and its subsidiaries.\nData privacy and security laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business could increase the cost of our operations and subject us to possible sanctions and other penalties.\nWe collect, process, store, use and share data, some of which contains personal information. Our business is therefore subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, including with respect to the collection, storage, use, transmission, sharing and protection of personal information and other consumer data. Such laws and regulations may be inconsistent among states, countries or between states and countries or conflict with other rules. In particular, the European Union, or EU, has adopted strict data privacy and security regulations. Following certain developments in the EU, including the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), data privacy and security compliance in the EU are increasingly complex and challenging. The GDPR created new compliance obligations applicable to our business and some of our players and imposed increased financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of global annual revenue for the preceding financial year or \u20ac20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious violations). Compliance with the GDPR and similar regulations increases our operational costs and can impact operational efficiencies.\nThe scope of data privacy and security regulations worldwide continues to evolve, and we believe that the adoption of increasingly restrictive regulations in this area is likely within the U.S. and other jurisdictions. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) went into effect on January 1, 2020. This law, among other things, requires new disclosures to California consumers, imposes new rules for collecting or using information about minors, and affords consumers new abilities to opt out of certain disclosures of personal information. It remains unclear how courts will interpret the CCPA. The U.S. Congress may also pass a law to preempt all or part of the CCPA. Further, California recently passed the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which amends the CCPA to provide more comprehensive privacy protections to consumers once it becomes effective in January 2023. The effects of the CCPA and CPRA may be significant and the CCPA required us to update our policies to include CCPA specific clauses and procedures. A number of other proposals related to data privacy or security are pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union is contemplating the adoption of the Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications, expected in 2021, that would govern data privacy and the protection of personal data in electronic communications, in particular for direct marketing purposes. Efforts to comply with these and other data privacy and security restrictions that may be enacted has required us to modify our data processing practices and policies and could cause us to further modify our practices and policies in the future and may increase the cost of our operations. Failure to comply with such restrictions could subject us to criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. In part due to the uncertainty of the legal climate, complying with regulations, and any applicable rules or guidance from self-regulatory organizations relating to privacy, data protection, information security and consumer protection, may result in substantial costs and may necessitate changes to our business practices, which may\ncompromise our growth strategy, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain players, and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to players or other third parties, or any other legal obligations or regulatory requirements relating to privacy, data protection, or information security may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, claims, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability, cause our players to lose trust in us, and otherwise materially and adversely affect our reputation and business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to us may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our games. Additionally, if third parties we work with violate applicable laws, regulations, or agreements, such violations may put our players\u2019 data at risk, could result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, fines, litigation, claims or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability, cause our players to lose trust in us and otherwise materially and adversely affect our reputation and business. Further, public scrutiny of, or complaints about, technology companies or their data handling or data protection practices, even if unrelated to our business, industry or operations, may lead to increased scrutiny of technology companies, including us, and may cause government agencies to enact additional regulatory requirements, or to modify their enforcement or investigation activities, which may increase our costs and risks.\nOur foreign operations expose us to business and legal risks.\nWe generate a portion of our revenue from operations outside of the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we derived approximately 14.8%, 15.1% and 8.6%, respectively, of our revenue from sales to players outside of the U.S. We also have significant operations, including game development operations, in Israel.\nOur operations in foreign jurisdictions may subject us to additional risks customarily associated with such operations, including: the complexity of foreign laws, regulations and markets; the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions; the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of foreign labor laws and disputes; the ability to attract and retain key personnel in foreign jurisdictions; the economic, tax and regulatory policies of local governments; compliance with applicable anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit U.S. persons and companies and their agents from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business; and compliance with applicable sanctions regimes regarding dealings with certain persons or countries. Certain of these laws also contain provisions that require accurate record keeping and further require companies to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.\nAlthough we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws, if those controls are ineffective or an employee or intermediary fails to comply with the applicable regulations, we may be subject to criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. Any such violation could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, our international business operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by terrorist activity, political unrest or other economic or political uncertainties. Moreover, foreign jurisdictions could impose tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other similar restrictions on our international sales.\nFurther, our ability to expand successfully in foreign jurisdictions involves other risks, including difficulties in integrating foreign operations, risks associated with entering jurisdictions in which we may have little experience and the day-to-day management of a growing and increasingly geographically diverse company. We may not realize the operating efficiencies, competitive advantages or financial results that we anticipate from our investments in foreign jurisdictions.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Scientific Games\nScientific Games controls the direction of our business, and the concentrated ownership of our common stock will prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant decisions.\nScientific Games, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, the SG Members, controls shares representing a majority of our combined voting power. The SG Members own all of our outstanding Class B common stock, which represents 81.9% of our total outstanding shares of common stock and 97.8% of the combined voting power of both classes of our outstanding common stock. On all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, our Class B common stock entitles its owners to ten votes per share (for so long as the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the SG Members and their affiliates represents at least 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock and, thereafter, one vote per\nshare), and our Class A common stock entitles its owners to one vote per share. As long as Scientific Games continues to control shares representing a majority of our combined voting power, it will generally be able to determine the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors (unless supermajority approval of such matter is required by applicable law). Even if Scientific Games were to control less than a majority of our combined voting power, it may be able to influence the outcome of corporate actions so long as it owns a significant portion of our combined voting power. If Scientific Games does not cause the SG Members to dispose of their shares of our common stock, Scientific Games could retain control over us for an extended period of time or indefinitely.\nInvestors will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote while Scientific Games controls the majority of our combined voting power (or, in the case of removal of directors, two-thirds of our combined voting power). Due to its ownership and rights under our articles of incorporation and our bylaws, Scientific Games is able to control, indirectly through the SG Members and subject to applicable law, the composition of our board of directors, which in turn is able to control all matters affecting us, including, among other things:\n\u2022any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers and, in the event of a vacancy on our board of directors, additional or replacement directors;\n\u2022any determinations with respect to mergers, business combinations or disposition of assets;\n\u2022determination of our management policies;\n\u2022determination of the composition of the committees on our board of directors;\n\u2022our financing policy;\n\u2022our compensation and benefit programs and other human resources policy decisions;\n\u2022termination of, changes to or determinations under our agreements with Scientific Games;\n\u2022changes to any other agreements that may adversely affect us;\n\u2022the payment of dividends on our Class A common stock; and\n\u2022determinations with respect to our tax returns.\nBecause Scientific Games\u2019 interests may differ from ours or from those of our other stockholders, actions that Scientific Games takes with respect to us, as our controlling stockholder, may not be favorable to us or our other stockholders.\nIf Scientific Games causes the SG Members to sell a controlling interest in our company to a third party in a private transaction, holders of our Class A common stock may not realize any change-of-control premium on shares of our Class A common stock, and we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party.\nScientific Games, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, the SG Members, holds approximately 97.8% of our combined voting power. Scientific Games has the ability, should it choose to do so, to cause the SG Members to sell some or all of their shares of our common stock and the LLC Interests the SG Members hold in a privately negotiated transaction, which, if sufficient in size, could result in a change of control of our company. See Note 1 for additional information.\nThe ability of Scientific Games to cause the SG Members to privately sell their shares of our common stock and the LLC Interests the SG Members hold, with no requirement for a concurrent offer to be made to acquire all of our shares that will be publicly traded hereafter, could prevent our stockholders from realizing any change-of- control premium on our stockholders\u2019 shares of our common stock that may otherwise accrue to Scientific Games on its private sale of our common stock and the LLC Interests it holds. Additionally, if Scientific Games causes the SG Members to privately sell shares representing a significant portion of our common stock, we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party. Such third party may have conflicts of interest with those of other stockholders. In addition, if Scientific Games causes the SG Members to sell a controlling interest in our company to a third party, any debt financing (including the Revolver) we secure in the future may be subject to acceleration, Scientific Games may terminate the Intercompany Services Agreement,\nthe IP License Agreement and other arrangements, and our other relationships and agreements, including our license agreements, could be impacted, all of which may adversely affect our ability to run our business as described herein and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nScientific Games\u2019 interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of our stockholders. Conflicts of interest between Scientific Games and us could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to us and our public stockholders.\nVarious conflicts of interest between us and Scientific Games exist and could arise. See Note 10 for additional information. Ownership interests of directors or officers of Scientific Games in our common stock and ownership interests of our directors and officers in the stock of Scientific Games, or a person\u2019s service either as a director or officer of both companies, could create or appear to create conflicts of interest when those directors and officers are faced with decisions relating to our company. These decisions could include:\n\u2022corporate opportunities;\n\u2022the impact that operating decisions for our business may have on Scientific Games\u2019 consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022differences in tax positions between Scientific Games and us, especially in light of the TRA (see \u201cRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure and the TRA\u201d);\n\u2022the impact that operating or capital decisions (including the incurrence of indebtedness) for our business may have on Scientific Games\u2019 current or future indebtedness or the covenants under that indebtedness;\n\u2022future, potential commercial arrangements between Scientific Games and us or between Scientific Games and third parties;\n\u2022business combinations involving us;\n\u2022our dividend policy;\n\u2022management stock ownership; and\n\u2022the intercompany agreements between Scientific Games and us.\nFurthermore, disputes may arise between Scientific Games and us relating to our past and ongoing relationship and these conflicts of interest may make it more difficult for us to favorably resolve such disputes, including those related to:\n\u2022tax, employee benefits, indemnification and other matters arising from the IPO;\n\u2022the nature, quality and pricing of services Scientific Games agrees to provide to us;\n\u2022sales or other disposals by the SG Members of all or a portion of their ownership interests in SciPlay Parent LLC or us; and\n\u2022business combinations involving us.\nWe may not be able to resolve any conflicts, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party. While we are controlled by Scientific Games, we may not have the leverage to negotiate amendments to our agreements with Scientific Games, if required, on terms as favorable to us as those we would negotiate with an unaffiliated third party.\nCertain of our directors and executive officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions with Scientific Games.\nBarry L. Cottle is Chairman of our board of directors and also serves as President and Chief Executive Officer at Scientific Games. Our chief accounting officer Michael F. Winterscheidt also holds an executive officer position with Scientific Games. In addition, these individuals may own Scientific Games common stock, options to purchase Scientific\nGames common stock or other Scientific Games equity awards. These individuals\u2019 holdings of Scientific Games\u2019 common stock, options to purchase Scientific Games common stock or other equity awards may be significant for some of these persons compared to these persons\u2019 total assets. Their positions at Scientific Games and the ownership of any Scientific Games equity or equity awards creates, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for Scientific Games than the decisions have for us.\nOur articles of incorporation limit Scientific Games\u2019 and its directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty and could also prevent us from benefiting from corporate opportunities that might otherwise have been available to us.\nOur articles of incorporation provide that, subject to any contractual provision to the contrary, Scientific Games has no obligation to refrain from:\n\u2022engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as we do;\n\u2022doing business with any of our clients, consumers, vendors or lessors;\n\u2022employing or otherwise engaging any of our officers or employees; or\n\u2022making investments in any property in which we may make investments.\nUnder our articles of incorporation, neither Scientific Games nor any officer or director of Scientific Games, except as provided in our articles of incorporation, is liable to us or to our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any of these activities.\nAdditionally, our articles of incorporation include a \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d provision in which we renounce any interests or expectancy in corporate opportunities which become known to (i) any of our directors or officers who are also directors, officers, employees or other affiliates of Scientific Games or its affiliates (except that we and our subsidiaries shall not be deemed affiliates of Scientific Games or its affiliates for the purposes of the provision), or dual persons, or (ii) Scientific Games itself, and which relate to the business of Scientific Games or may constitute a corporate opportunity for both Scientific Games and us. Generally, neither Scientific Games nor our directors or officers who are also dual persons is liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such person pursues or acquires any corporate opportunity for the account of Scientific Games or its affiliates, directs, recommends, sells, assigns or otherwise transfers such corporate opportunity to Scientific Games or its affiliates, or does not communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us. The corporate opportunity provision may exacerbate conflicts of interest between Scientific Games and us because the provision effectively permits one of our directors or officers who also serves as a director, officer, employee or other affiliate of Scientific Games to choose to direct a corporate opportunity to Scientific Games instead of us.\nScientific Games is not restricted from competing with us in the social gaming business, including as a result of acquiring a company that operates a social gaming business. Due to the significant resources of Scientific Games, including its intellectual property (all of which Scientific Games will retain and certain of which it licenses to us under the IP License Agreement), financial resources, name recognition and know-how resulting from the previous management of our business, Scientific Games could have a significant competitive advantage over us should it decide to utilize these resources to engage in the type of business we conduct, which may cause our operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected.\nThird parties may seek to hold us responsible for liabilities of Scientific Games, which could result in a decrease in our income.\nThird parties may seek to hold us responsible for Scientific Games\u2019 liabilities. If those liabilities are significant and we are ultimately held liable for them, we cannot assure that we will be able to recover the full amount of our losses from Scientific Games.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nScientific Games controls a majority of our combined voting power. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the NASDAQ rules. Under these rules, a listed company of\nwhich more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022the requirement that its director nominations be made, or recommended to the full board of directors, by its independent directors or by a nominations committee that is comprised entirely of independent directors and that it adopt a written charter or board resolution addressing the nominations process; and\n\u2022the requirement that it have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nAs a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ rules. We may choose to rely on additional exemptions in the future so long as we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of being a standalone public company.\nWe may not be able to achieve all of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits expected as a result of being a standalone public company, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. These anticipated benefits include the following:\n\u2022allowing investors to evaluate the distinct merits, performance and future prospects of our business, independent of Scientific Games\u2019 other businesses;\n\u2022improving our strategic and operational flexibility and increasing management focus as we continue to implement our strategic plan and allowing us to respond more effectively to different player needs and the competitive environment for our business;\n\u2022allowing us to adopt a capital structure better suited to our financial profile and business needs, without competing for capital with Scientific Games\u2019 other businesses;\n\u2022creating an independent equity structure that will facilitate our ability to effect future acquisitions utilizing our capital stock; and\n\u2022facilitating incentive compensation arrangements for employees more directly tied to the performance of our business, and enhancing employee hiring and retention by, among other things, improving the alignment of management and employee incentives with performance and growth objectives of our business.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits of being a standalone public company for a variety of reasons, and it could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on our access to Scientific Games\u2019 brands and reputation, some of Scientific Games\u2019 relationships, and the brands and reputations of unaffiliated third parties.\nWe believe the association with Scientific Games has contributed to our building relationships with our players due to its recognized brands and products, as well as resources such as Scientific Games\u2019 intellectual property and access to third parties\u2019 intellectual property. Any perceived or actual loss of Scientific Games\u2019 scale, capital base and financial strength may prompt business partners to reprice, modify or terminate their relationships with us.\nFor more detail regarding our reliance on access to intellectual property owned by Scientific Games, see \u201cWe rely on the ability to use the intellectual property rights of Scientific Games and other third parties, including the third-party intellectual property rights licensed to Scientific Games that we have enjoyed as an indirect subsidiary of Scientific Games, and we may lose the benefit of any intellectual property owned by or licensed to Scientific Games if it ceases to hold certain minimum percentages of the voting power in our company.\u201d\nIn addition, we believe that the success of certain of our games depends on the popularity of intellectual property or brands of third parties that are incorporated into their player experience. For example, the success of our MONOPOLY Slots\ngame is based in part on the strength of the MONOPOLY brand, which is owned and managed by unaffiliated third parties. We cannot assure the continued popularity of any of the intellectual property or brands that are incorporated into our games, and a loss of such popularity may result in decreased interest in our games.\nThe services that we receive from Scientific Games may not be sufficient for us to operate our business, and we would likely incur significant incremental costs if we lost access to Scientific Games\u2019 services.\nWe have obtained, and will need to continue to obtain, services from Scientific Games relating to many important corporate functions under an intercompany services agreement. Our financial statements reflect charges for these services based on the intercompany services agreement we entered into in September 2016. Many of these services are governed by a new intercompany services agreement entered into in connection with the IPO (\u201cIntercompany Services Agreement\u201d) with Scientific Games. Under the Intercompany Services Agreement, we are able to continue to use these Scientific Games services for a fixed term established on a service-by-service basis. We generally have the right to terminate a service before its stated termination date if we give notice to Scientific Games. Partial reduction in the provision of any service will require Scientific Games\u2019 consent. In addition, either party is able to terminate the Intercompany Services Agreement due to a material breach of the other party, upon prior written notice, subject to limited cure periods. We pay Scientific Games mutually agreed-upon fees for these services, which is based on Scientific Games\u2019 costs of providing the services.\nIf we lost access to the services provided to us by Scientific Games under the Intercompany Services Agreement, we would need to replicate or replace certain functions, systems and infrastructure. We may also need to make investments or hire additional employees to operate without the same access to Scientific Games\u2019 existing operational and administrative infrastructure. These initiatives may be costly to implement. Due to the scope and complexity of the underlying projects relative to these efforts, the amount of total costs could be materially higher than our estimate, and the timing of the incurrence of these costs could be subject to change.\nWe may not be able to replace these services or enter into appropriate third-party agreements on terms and conditions, including cost, comparable to those that we have received in the past and will continue to receive from Scientific Games under the Intercompany Services Agreement.\nAdditionally, if the Intercompany Services Agreement is terminated, we may be unable to sustain the services at the same levels or obtain the same benefits as when we were receiving such services and benefits from Scientific Games. If we have to operate these functions separately, if we do not have our own adequate systems and business functions in place or if we are unable to obtain them from other providers, we may not be able to operate our business effectively or at comparable costs, and our profitability may decline. In addition, we have historically received informal support from Scientific Games, which may not be addressed in our Intercompany Services Agreement. The level of this informal support could diminish or be eliminated.\nWhile we are controlled by Scientific Games, we may not have the leverage to negotiate amendments to our agreements with Scientific Games, if required, on terms as favorable to us as those we would negotiate with an unaffiliated third party.\nOur historical financial results are not necessarily representative of the results we have or may achieve as a standalone company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nCertain of our historical financial results included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a standalone company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future. This is primarily the result of the following factors:\n\u2022certain of our historical financial results reflect charges for certain support functions that are provided on a centralized basis within Scientific Games, such as expenses for business technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development, public affairs and procurement under a prior intercompany services agreement, and we entered into a new Intercompany Services Agreement in connection with the IPO;\n\u2022certain of our historical financial results reflect charges for the use of certain proprietary and third-party intellectual property licensed or sublicensed from Scientific Games under a prior intercompany intellectual property license agreement, and we have entered into a new IP License Agreement in connection with the IPO;\n\u2022our cost of debt and our capital structure are and may be different from that reflected in our historical financial statements; and\n\u2022we have incurred and continue to incur additional ongoing costs as a result of the IPO, including costs related to public company reporting, investor relations and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d);\nOur financial condition and future results of operations could be materially different from amounts reflected in our historical financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, so it may be difficult for investors to compare our future results to historical results or to evaluate our relative performance or trends in our business.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure and the TRA\nOur sole material asset is our interest in SciPlay Parent LLC, and, accordingly, we depend on distributions from SciPlay Parent LLC to pay our taxes and expenses, including payments under the TRA. SciPlay Parent LLC\u2019s ability to make such distributions have been and may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of LLC Interests of SciPlay Parent LLC. As such, we have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes and operating expenses or declare and pay dividends in the future, if any, is dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of SciPlay Parent LLC and its subsidiaries and distributions we receive from SciPlay Parent LLC. We cannot assure that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions will permit such distributions.\nSciPlay Parent LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to holders of LLC Interests, including us. Accordingly, we will incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of SciPlay Parent LLC. Under the terms of the Operating Agreement, SciPlay Parent LLC is obligated to make tax distributions to holders of LLC Interests, including us. In addition to tax expenses, we also incur expenses related to our operations, including payments under the TRA, which we expect to be substantial. We intend, as its sole manager, to cause SciPlay Parent LLC to make cash distributions to the owners of LLC Interests in an amount sufficient to (i) fund all or part of such members\u2019 tax obligations in respect of taxable income allocated to such members and (ii) cover our operating expenses, including ordinary course payments under the TRA. However, SciPlay Parent LLC\u2019s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, such as restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which SciPlay Parent LLC is then a party, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering SciPlay Parent LLC insolvent. Moreover, the terms governing the Revolver generally do not permit SciPlay Parent LLC, as a guarantor of the Revolver, to make distributions sufficient to allow us to make early termination payments under the TRA. If we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason, the unpaid amounts will accrue interest until paid. Our failure to make any payment required under the TRA (including any accrued and unpaid interest) within 30 calendar days of the date on which the payment is required to be made will constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the TRA, which will terminate the TRA and accelerate future payments thereunder, unless the applicable payment is not made because (i) we are prohibited from making such payment under the terms of the TRA or the terms governing certain of our secured indebtedness or (ii) we do not have, and cannot use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, sufficient funds to make such payment. Any late payments will continue to accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 500 basis points until such payments are made. It will also constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the TRA if we make a distribution of cash or other property (other than shares of our Class A common stock) to our stockholders or use cash or other property to repurchase any of our capital stock (including our Class A common stock), in each case while any outstanding payments under the TRA are unpaid. In addition, if SciPlay Parent LLC does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends will also be restricted or impaired.\nThe TRA with the SG Members requires us to make cash payments to the SG Members in respect of certain tax benefits to which we may become entitled, and the payments we are required to make have been and will be substantial.\nWe are a party to the TRA with the SG Members and SciPlay Parent LLC. Under the TRA, we are required to make cash payments to the SG Members equal to 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (1) the increases in the tax basis of assets of SciPlay Parent LLC (a) in connection with the IPO, including as a result of the Upfront License Payment, (b) resulting from any redemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests by the SG Members pursuant to the Operating Agreement or (c) resulting from certain distributions (or deemed distributions) by SciPlay Parent LLC and (2) certain other tax benefits related to our making of\npayments under the TRA. We expect that the amount of the cash payments that we will be required to make under the TRA will be substantial. Any payments made by us to the SG Members under the TRA will generally reduce the amount of cash that might have otherwise been available to us. In addition, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid entering into any agreements that could be reasonably anticipated to materially delay the timing of the making of any payments under the TRA, which could limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions. Furthermore, our future obligations to make payments under the TRA could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are the subject of the TRA.\nThe actual amount and timing of any payments under the TRA will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions or exchanges by the SG Members, the amount of gain recognized by the SG Members, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate, and the applicable tax rates and laws. Such aggregate cash payments made to the SG Members in 2020 was $2.5 million.\nIn certain cases, future payments under the TRA to the SG Members may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA.\nThe TRA provides that if (i) we materially breach any of our material obligations under the TRA, including if we make any distribution of cash or property (other than shares of our Class A common stock) to our stockholders or any repurchase of our capital stock (including our Class A common stock) before all our payment obligations under the TRA have been satisfied for all prior taxable years, (ii) certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination or other changes of control (including under certain material indebtedness of SciPlay Parent LLC or its subsidiaries) were to occur, or (iii) we elect an early termination of the TRA, then our future obligations, or our successor\u2019s future obligations, under the TRA to make payments thereunder would accelerate and become due and payable, based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the TRA, and an assumption that, as of the effective date of the acceleration, any SG Member that has LLC Interests not yet exchanged shall be deemed to have exchanged such LLC Interests on such date, even if we do not receive the corresponding tax benefits until a later date when the LLC Interests are actually exchanged.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the estimated present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the TRA, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of those future tax benefits and, therefore, we could be required to make payments under the TRA that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual tax benefits we ultimately realize. In addition, to the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason, the unpaid amounts will accrue interest until paid. Our failure to make any payment required under the TRA (including any accrued and unpaid interest) within 30 calendar days of the date on which the payment is required to be made will constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the TRA, which will terminate the TRA and accelerate future payments thereunder, unless the applicable payment is not made because (i) we are prohibited from making such payment under the terms of the TRA or the terms governing certain of our secured indebtedness or (ii) we do not have, and cannot use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, sufficient funds to make such payment. In these situations, our obligations under the TRA could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. We cannot assure that we will be able to fund or finance our obligations under the TRA.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made to the SG Members under the TRA in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nPayments under the TRA are based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and the IRS or another tax authority may challenge all or part of the tax basis increases, as well as other related tax positions we take, and a court could sustain any such challenge. Our ability to settle or to forgo contesting such challenges may be restricted by the rights of the SG Members pursuant to the TRA, and such restrictions apply for as long as the TRA remains in effect. In addition, we will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the SG Members under the TRA in the event that any tax benefits initially claimed by us and for which payment has been made to the SG Members are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to the SG Members will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make to the SG Members under the terms of the TRA. However, we might not determine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to the SG Members for a number of years following the initial time of such payment. As a result, payments could be made under the TRA in excess of the tax savings that we realize in respect of the tax attributes with respect to the SG Members that are the subject of the TRA.\nIf we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a result of our ownership of SciPlay Parent LLC, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUnder Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), a company generally will be deemed to be an \u201cinvestment company\u201d for purposes of the 1940 Act if (1) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or (2) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an \u201cinvestment company,\u201d as such term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.\nAs the sole manager of SciPlay Parent LLC, we control SciPlay Parent LLC. On that basis, we believe that our interest in SciPlay Parent LLC is not an \u201cinvestment security\u201d as that term is used in the 1940 Act. However, if we were to cease participation in the management of SciPlay Parent LLC, our interest in SciPlay Parent LLC could be deemed an \u201cinvestment security\u201d for purposes of the 1940 Act.\nWe and SciPlay Parent LLC intend to conduct our operations so that we are not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the completion of the IPO. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to: (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (iii) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are only required to provide two years of audited financial statements and two years of selected financial data in our prospectus dated May 2, 2019, filed with the SEC on May 6, 2019 pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (referred to herein as the \u201cProspectus\u201d). We currently intend to take advantage of each of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions described above. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our shares and our stock price may be more volatile.\nOur status as an emerging growth company will end as soon as any of the following takes place:\n\u2022the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue;\n\u2022the date we qualify as a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates;\n\u2022the date on which we have issued, in any three-year period, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or\n\u2022the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our Class A common stock.\nOn matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, our Class B common stock has ten votes per share (for so long as the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the SG Members and their affiliates represents at least 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock and, thereafter, one vote per share) and our Class A common stock has one\nvote per share. These differences in voting rights may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock to the extent that any current or future investor in our common stock ascribes value to the voting rights associated with the Class B common stock. The existence of dual classes of our common stock could result in less liquidity for any such class than if there were only one class of our capital stock.\nIn addition, S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain indices that will exclude companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to such indices. In addition, several shareholder advisory firms have announced their opposition to the use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common stock in such indices and may cause shareholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for our Class A common stock. Any actions or publications by shareholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.\nThe requirements of being a public company require significant resources and management attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we incur legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur before becoming a public company. We are subject to the Exchange Act, including the reporting requirements thereunder, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the NASDAQ rules and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nPursuant to Section 404, once we are no longer an emerging growth company, we may be required to furnish an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. When our independent registered public accounting firm is required to undertake an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, the cost of complying with Section 404 will significantly increase, and management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to comply with the requirements of Section 404, which will further increase our cost and expense. In addition, enhanced legal and regulatory regimes and heightened standards relating to corporate governance and disclosure for public companies result in increased legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may suffer harm to our reputation and investor confidence level.\nIf we fail to implement the requirements of Section 404(b) in the required timeframe once we are no longer an emerging growth company, we may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, including the SEC and the NASDAQ. Furthermore, if we are unable to continue to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures required of public companies or when necessary implement new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. As of December 31, 2020, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on criteria outlined in Part II, Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, however, we cannot assure that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future.\nThe SG Members have the right to have their LLC Interests redeemed or exchanged into shares of Class A common stock, which, if exercised, will dilute our stockholders\u2019 economic interest in SciPlay.\nWe have an aggregate of 602,138,807 shares of Class A common stock authorized but unissued, including 103,547,021 shares of Class A common stock issuable upon redemption or exchange of LLC Interests that are held by the SG Members. SciPlay Parent LLC entered into the Operating Agreement and, subject to certain restrictions set forth therein, the SG Members are entitled to have their LLC Interests redeemed or exchanged for shares of our Class A common stock or, at our option, cash.\nShares of our Class B common stock will be canceled on a one-for-one basis whenever the SG Members\u2019 LLC Interests are so redeemed or exchanged. While any redemption or exchange of LLC Interests and corresponding cancellation of our Class B common stock will reduce the SG Members\u2019 economic interest in SciPlay Parent LLC and its voting interest in us, the related issuance of our Class A common stock will dilute our stockholders\u2019 economic interest in SciPlay. We cannot predict the timing or size of any future issuances of our Class A common stock resulting from the redemption or exchange of LLC Interests.\nFuture issuances or resales of Class A common stock by the SG Members or others, or the perception that such issuances or resales may occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common shares to decline.\nWe entered into the Registration Rights Agreement with the SG Members, pursuant to which the shares of Class A common stock issued to the SG Members upon redemption or exchange of LLC Interests will be eligible for resale, subject to certain limitations set forth therein. Any shares issued under our equity incentive plans pursuant to one or more effective registration statements will be eligible for sale in the public market, except to the extent that they are restricted by lock-up agreements and subject to compliance with Rule 144 in the case of our affiliates.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock, including upon the redemption or exchange of LLC Interests, may have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, including shares issued in connection with an acquisition, or the perception that such sales or distributions could occur, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our Class A common stock.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not presently intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock. However, we reconsider our dividend policy on a regular basis and may determine in the future to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock. Therefore, our stockholders may not receive any dividends on their Class A common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in our Class A common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. Moreover, any ability to pay dividends will be restricted by the terms of the Revolver, and may also be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of us or our subsidiaries. Consequently, investors may need to sell all or part of their holdings of our Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Nevada law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt an unsolicited bid to acquire our company. These provisions include:\n\u2022rules regarding how our stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022empowering only the board of directors to fill any vacancy on our board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u2022the absence of cumulative voting rights in the election of directors;\n\u2022limiting the ability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings after Scientific Games ceases to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of our combined voting power; and\n\u2022the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nThese provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many stockholders. Nevada law could also prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and incumbent directors. As a result, stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares or control our management or board.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or\ncould otherwise adversely affect holders of our Class A common stock, which could depress the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize us to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors will have the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our Class A common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discourage bids for our Class A common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are and may be in the future subject to securities class action, which may harm our business and operating results.\nCompanies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We are and may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us may result in substantial costs and damages, and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which may seriously harm our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For additional information regarding our litigation, see Note 11.\nWe may also be called on to defend ourselves against lawsuits relating to our business operations. Some of these claims may seek significant damage amounts due to the nature of our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. A future unfavorable outcome in a legal proceeding could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, current and future litigation, regardless of its merits, could result in substantial legal fees, settlement or judgment costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. For additional information regarding our litigation, see Note 11.\nOur inability to complete acquisitions and integrate those businesses successfully could limit our growth or disrupt our plans and operations.\nFrom time to time, we pursue strategic acquisitions, such as our acquisition of Come2Play in June 2020. Our ability to succeed in implementing our strategy will depend to some degree upon our ability to identify and complete commercially viable acquisitions. We cannot assure that acquisition opportunities will be available on acceptable terms or at all, or that we will be able to obtain necessary financing or regulatory approvals to complete potential acquisitions.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses that we acquire or do so within the intended timeframes. We could face significant challenges in managing and integrating our acquisitions and our combined operations, including acquired assets, operations and personnel. In addition, the expected cost synergies associated with such acquisitions may not be fully realized in the anticipated amounts or within the contemplated timeframes or cost expectations, which could result in increased costs and have an adverse effect on our prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We would expect to incur incremental costs and capital expenditures related to integration activities.\nAcquisition transactions may disrupt our ongoing business. The integration of acquisitions requires significant time and focus from management and might divert attention from the day-to-day operations of the combined business or delay the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nFailure in pursuing or executing new business initiatives could have a material adverse impact on our business and future growth.\nOur growth strategy includes evaluating, considering and effectively executing new business initiatives, which can be difficult. Management may not properly ascertain or assess the risks of new initiatives, and subsequent events may alter the risks that were evaluated at the time we decided to execute any new initiative. In particular, initiatives may be subject to intense competition due to low barriers to entry and the difficulty of differentiating games. Entering into any new initiative can also divert our management\u2019s attention from other business issues and opportunities. Failure to effectively identify, pursue and execute new business initiatives, may adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may suffer if we do not successfully manage our current and potential future growth.\nWe have grown significantly in recent years and we intend to continue to expand the scope and geographic reach of the games we provide. Our total revenue increased to $582.2 million in 2020, from $465.8 million in 2019, and $416.2 million in 2018. Our anticipated future growth will likely place significant demands on our management and operations. Our success in managing our growth will depend, to a significant degree, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of senior management to operate effectively, and on our ability to improve and develop our financial and management information systems, controls and procedures. In addition, we will likely have to successfully adapt our existing systems and introduce new systems, expand, train and manage our employees and improve and expand our sales and marketing capabilities.\nIf we are unable to properly and prudently manage our operations as they continue to grow, or if the quality of our games deteriorates due to mismanagement, our brand name and reputation could be severely harmed, and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate and social responsibility and reputation.\nMany factors influence our reputation including the perception held by our customers, business partners and other key stakeholders. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities. We risk damage to our reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity and inclusion, sustainability and social responsibility. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention, our corporate culture and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our key providers or suppliers operate.\nWe may be impacted by severe weather and other geological events, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or tsunamis that could disrupt our operations or the operations of our key providers or suppliers. Natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our key providers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 facilities, such as AWS, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, may impair the operation, development or provision of our games. While we insure against certain business interruption risks, we cannot assure that such insurance will compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters. Any serious disruption to our operations, or those of our key providers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings, or the examination of our tax positions, could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Our existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws.\nHowever, the tax benefits that we intend to eventually derive could be undermined due to future changes in tax laws. In addition, the taxing authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we do business regularly examine income and other tax returns and we expect that they may examine our income and other tax returns. The ultimate outcome of these examinations cannot be predicted with certainty.\nLegal proceedings may materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe have been party to, are currently party to, and in the future may become subject to additional, legal proceedings in the operation of our business, including, but not limited to, with respect to consumer protection, gambling-related matters, employee matters, alleged service and system malfunctions, alleged intellectual property infringement, claims relating to our contracts, licenses and strategic investments, alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, alleged breaches of other certain governance documents and alleged violations of the securities laws in connection with the IPO. See Note 11 for additional information.\nFor example, in 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided that a social casino game produced by one of our competitors should be considered illegal gambling under Washington state law. In April 2018, a\nputative class action lawsuit, Sheryl Fife v. Scientific Games Corp., was filed against our parent, Scientific Games, in federal district court that is directed against certain of our social casino games, including Jackpot Party Casino. The plaintiff alleges substantially the same causes of action against our social casino games that are alleged with respect to Big Fish Casino, including the allegation that our social casino games violate Washington State gambling laws. In December 2018, the federal district court assigned to the litigation denied Scientific Games\u2019 motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. In January 2019, Scientific Games filed its answer and affirmative defenses to the putative class action complaint. See Note 11 for further discussion. We may incur significant expense defending this lawsuit or any other lawsuit to which we may be a party. Although the case was brought against Scientific Games, pursuant to the Intercompany Services Agreement, we would expect to cover or contribute to any damage awards due to the matter arising as a result of our business. If the plaintiff were to obtain a judgment in her favor in this lawsuit, then our results in Washington could be negatively impacted, and we could be restricted from operating social casino games in Washington. Additional legal proceedings targeting our social casino games and claiming violations of state or federal laws also could occur, based on the unique and particular laws of each jurisdiction. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing or scope of the consequences of such an outcome, or the outcome of any other legal proceedings to which we may be a party, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nOur insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nWe believe that we maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Moreover, any loss incurred could exceed policy limits and policy payments made to us may not be made on a timely basis. Such losses could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 18573, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "SCPL"}
