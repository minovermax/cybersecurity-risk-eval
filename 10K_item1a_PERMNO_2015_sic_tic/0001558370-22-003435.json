{"cik": "1585608", "company": "Jaguar Health, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company may be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below. Anyone or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause the Company\u2019s actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\u25cf We have a limited operating history, expect to incur further losses as we grow and may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\n\u25cf We expect to incur significant additional costs as we continue commercialization efforts for current prescription drug candidates or other product candidates, and undertake the clinical trials necessary to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals, which will increase our losses.\n\u25cf We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future in the event that we conduct clinical trials for new indications and we may be unable to raise such funds when needed and on acceptable terms, which would force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate one or more of our product development programs.\n\u25cf We are substantially dependent on the success of Mytesi, our current lead prescription drug product, and Canalevia-CA1, our conditionally approved prescription drug product for CID in dogs, and Canalevia-CA2, our candidate for EID in dogs. We cannot be certain that necessary approvals will be received for planned Mytesi, Canalevia-CA1 or Canalevia-CA2 follow-on indications or that these product candidates will be successfully commercialized, either by us or any of our partners.\n\u25cf If we are not successful in identifying, licensing, developing and commercializing additional product candidates and products, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives could be impaired.\n\u25cf Mytesi faces significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies, both for its currently approved indication and for planned follow-on indications, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\n\u25cf We may be unable to obtain, or obtain on a timely basis, regulatory approval for our existing or future human or animal prescription drug product candidates under applicable regulatory requirements, which would harm our operating results.\n\u25cf The results of our earlier studies of Mytesi may not be predictive of the results in any future clinical trials and species-specific formulation studies, respectively, and we may not be successful in our efforts to develop or commercialize line extensions of Mytesi.\n\u25cf Development of prescription drug products is inherently expensive, time-consuming and uncertain, and any delay or discontinuance of our current or future pivotal trials would harm our business and prospects.\n\u25cf We will partially rely on third parties to conduct our development activities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize our current or future human or animal product candidates on a timely basis, or at all.\n\u25cf Even if we obtain regulatory approval for planned follow-on indications of crofelemer, Canalevia or our other product candidates, they may never achieve market acceptance. Further, even if we are successful in the ongoing commercialization of Mytesi and Canalevia, we may not achieve commercial success.\n\u25cf Human and animal gastrointestinal health products are subject to unanticipated post-approval safety or efficacy concerns, which may harm our business and reputation.\n\u25cf Future federal and state legislation may result in increased exposure to product liability claims, which could result in substantial losses.\n\u25cf If we fail to retain current members of our senior management, or to identify, attract, integrate and retain additional key personnel, our business will be harmed.\n\u25cf We are dependent on two suppliers for the raw material used to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Mytesi and Canalevia. The termination of either of these contracts would result in a disruption to product development and our business will be harmed.\n\u25cf We are dependent upon third-party contract manufacturers, both for the supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1, as well as for the supply of finished products for commercialization.\n\u25cf If we are unable to establish sales capabilities on our own or through third parties, we may not be able to market and sell our current or future human products and product candidates, if approved, and generate\nproduct or other revenue.\n\u25cf We will need to increase the size of our organization and may not successfully manage such growth.\n\u25cf Canalevia-CA1 and, our animal health prescription drug product candidates, if approved may be marketed in the United States only in the target animals and for the indications for which they are approved, and if we want to expand the approved animals or indications, it will need to obtain additional approvals, which may not be granted.\n\u25cf The misuse or extra-label use of Mytesi, Canalevia, and our human or animal prescription drug product candidates if approved by regulatory authorities, may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages.\n\u25cf We may be unable to obtain, or obtain on a timely basis, a renewal of conditional approval for Canalevia-CA1, or to eventually obtain full regulatory approval of Canalevia-CA1, which would harm our operating results.\n\u25cf We may not maintain the benefits associated with MUMS designation, including market exclusivity.\n\u25cf The market for our human and animal products, and the gastrointestinal health market as a whole, is uncertain and may be smaller than we anticipate, which could lead to lower revenue and harm our operating results.\n\u25cf Insurance coverage for Mytesi for its current approved indication could decrease or end, or Mytesi might not receive insurance coverage for any approved follow-on indications, which could lead to lower revenue and harm our operating results.\n\u25cf We may engage in future acquisitions that increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks.\n\u25cf Certain of the countries in which we plan to commercialize our products in the future are developing countries, some of which have potentially unstable political and economic climates.\n\u25cf Fluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies could result in currency transactions losses.\n\u25cf Laws and regulations governing global trade compliance could adversely impact our business.\n\u25cf There are other gastrointestinal-focused human pharmaceutical companies, and we face competition in the marketplaces in which we operate or plan to operate.\n\u25cf Our obligations to Streeterville are secured by a security interest in all of Napo\u2019s lechlemer assets, so if we default on those obligations, Streeterville could foreclose on our assets.\n\u25cf Our royalty interests require us to make minimum royalty payments, even if we do not sell a sufficient amount of products to cover the amount of such payments, which may strain our cash resources.\n\u25cf Failure in our information technology systems, including by cyber-attacks or other data security incidents, could significantly disrupt our operations.\n\u25cf The novel coronavirus global pandemic could adversely impact our business, including our supply chain, clinical trials and commercialization of Mytesi and Canalevia.\n\u25cf Long-term remote work arrangements may adversely affect our business.\n\u25cf Substantially all of our revenue for recent periods has been received from three customers.\n\u25cf We are subject to state laws in California that require gender and diversity quotas for boards of directors of public companies headquartered in California.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u25cf We cannot be certain that our patent strategy will be effective to protect against competition\n\u25cf Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\n\u25cf Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, which would be costly, time-consuming and, if successfully asserted against us, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our current or future products and product candidates.\n\u25cf Our proprietary position depends upon the botanical guidance of our drug approval and patents that are formulation or method-of-use patents, which do not prevent a competitor from using the same human or animal drug for another use.\n\u25cf We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time-\nconsuming and unsuccessful, and third parties may challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents and they may be successful.\n\u25cf If we are unable to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information to third parties, our competitive position may be impaired.\n\u25cf Changes in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\n\u25cf We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could impair our business.\n\u25cf Our business could be harmed if we fail to obtain certain registered trademarks in the United States or in other countries.\n\u25cf We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\n\u25cf Even if we receive any of the required regulatory approvals for our current or future prescription drug product candidates and non-prescription products, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense.\n\u25cf Any of our current or future prescription drug product candidates or non-prescription products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we would be required to report to regulatory authorities and, if we fail to do so, we could be subject to sanctions that would harm our business.\n\u25cf Legislative or regulatory reforms with respect to animal health may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of any of our current or future product candidates and to produce, market, and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\n\u25cf We believe that our non-prescription products are not subject to regulation by regulatory agencies in the United States, but there is a risk that regulatory bodies may disagree with our interpretation, or may redefine the scope of their regulatory reach in the future, which would result in additional expense and could delay or prevent the commercialization of these products.\n\u25cf Even if we receive the required regulatory approvals for our current or future prescription drug product candidates and non-prescription products, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u25cf Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\n\u25cf If we issue all shares available for issuance pursuant to the ATM Agreement, we will have no shares of common stock available for new securities issuances, which may restrict us from accessing additional capital through the sale of new securities.\n\u25cf If our shares become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.\n\u25cf The price of our common stock could be subject to volatility related or unrelated to our operations, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\n\u25cf A possible \u201cshort squeeze\u201d due to a sudden increase in demand of our common stock that largely exceeds supply may lead to further price volatility in our common stock.\n\u25cf You may not be able to resell our common stock when you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider attractive or satisfactory.\n\u25cf If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our company, or if they issue adverse or misleading opinions regarding us or our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\n\u25cf You may be diluted by conversions of outstanding shares of non-voting common stock, exercises of outstanding options and warrants and issuances of securities pursuant to our ATM Agreement.\n\u25cf Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment of management.\n\u25cf Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\n\u25cf We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and your ability to achieve a return on your\ninvestment will depend on appreciation in the market price of our common stock.\n\u25cf The requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\n\u25cf We are a smaller reporting company and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history, expect to incur further losses as we grow and may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nSince the consummation of our merger with Napo Pharmaceuticals Inc. in 2017, our operations have been primarily focused on research, development and the ongoing commercialization of our lead prescription drug product, Mytesi, which is approved by the U.S. FDA for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy. As a result, we have limited meaningful historical operations upon which to evaluate our business and prospects and have not yet demonstrated an ability to broadly commercialize any of our human health products beyond Mytesi for HIV-related diarrhea or animal health products, obtain any required marketing approval for any of our animal prescription drug product candidates or successfully overcome the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in emerging fields such as the animal health industry or the gastrointestinal health industry in general. Our revenues to date have been insufficient to offset our expenses, and we expect to continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses. Our net loss and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $52.6 million and $33.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had total stockholders\u2019 equity of $11.9 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, which will increase significantly from historical levels as we expand our product development activities, seek necessary approvals for our human and veterinary drug product candidates, conduct species-specific formulation studies for our non-prescription products and increase commercialization activities. Even if we succeed in developing and broadly commercializing one or more of our products or product candidates, we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never become profitable. If we fail to achieve or maintain profitability, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or cease operations.\nAs more fully discussed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as we do not currently have sufficient cash resources to fund our operations through March 11, 2023, or one year from the filing date of our Form 10-K. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose their investment.\nWe expect to incur significant additional costs as we continue commercialization efforts for current prescription drug candidates or other product candidates, and undertake the clinical trials necessary to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals, which will increase our losses.\nNapo commenced sales of Mytesi for adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy in September 2016. Jaguar launched Canalevia-CA1 for chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in dogs in December 2021. We will need to continue to invest in developing our internal and third-party sales and distribution network and outreach efforts to key opinion leaders in the gastrointestinal health industry, including physicians and veterinarians as applicable.\nWe are actively identifying additional products for development and commercialization, and will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future to develop Mytesi, lechlemer and Canalevia-CA1. These expenditures will include costs associated with:\n\u25cf identifying additional potential prescription drug product candidates and non-prescription products;\n\u25cf formulation studies;\n\u25cf conducting pilot, pivotal and toxicology studies;\n\u25cf completing other research and development activities;\n\u25cf payments to technology licensors;\n\u25cf maintaining our intellectual property;\n\u25cf obtaining necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf establishing commercial supply capabilities; and\n\u25cf sales, marketing and distribution of our commercialized products.\nWe also may incur unanticipated costs in connection with developing and commercializing our products. Because the outcome of our development activities and commercialization efforts is inherently uncertain, the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our current or future products and product candidates may be greater than we anticipate.\nBecause we anticipate incurring significant costs for the foreseeable future, if we are not successful in broadly commercializing any of our current or future products or product candidates or raising additional funding to pursue our research and development efforts, we may never realize the benefit of our development efforts and our business may be harmed.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future in the event that we conduct clinical trials for new indications and we may be unable to raise such funds when needed and on acceptable terms, which would force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate one or more of our product development programs.\nWe are forecasting continued losses and negative cash flows as we continue to fund our operating and marketing activities and research and development programs, and to complete the development of all the current products in our pipeline, or any additional products we may identify. We will need to seek additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources such as strategic collaborations. Any such financings or collaborations may result in dilution to our stockholders, the imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations or other restrictions that may harm our business or the value of our common stock. We may also seek from time to time to raise additional capital based upon favorable market conditions or strategic considerations such as potential acquisitions or potential license arrangements.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our current and future prescription drug product candidates and non-prescription products;\n\u25cf the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining any regulatory approvals for our current and any future products;\n\u25cf the number and characteristics of the products we pursue;\n\u25cf the cost of manufacturing our current and future products and any products we successfully commercialize;\n\u25cf the cost of commercialization activities for Mytesi and Canalevia, if approved, including sales,\nmarketing and distribution costs;\n\u25cf the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u25cf the costs associated with being a public company;\n\u25cf our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, distribution or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; and\n\u25cf the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing possible patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of any such litigation.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all or we may not have sufficient authorized shares to raise additional capital. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate one or more of our product development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of Mytesi, our current lead prescription drug product, and Canalevia-CA1, our conditionally approved prescription drug product for CID in dogs, and Canalevia-CA2, our candidate for EID in dogs. We cannot be certain that necessary approvals will be received for planned Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1 follow-on indications or that these product candidates will be successfully commercialized, either by us or any of our partners.\nOther than Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1 (for which we have conditional approval), we currently do not have regulatory approval for any of our prescription drug product candidates. Our current efforts are primarily focused on the ongoing commercialization of Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1, and development efforts related to Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1. With regard to Mytesi, we are focused on marketing the product in the United States as well as on development efforts related to a follow-on indication for Mytesi in CTD, an important supportive care indication for patients undergoing primary or adjuvant chemotherapy for cancer treatment, and symptomatic relief of COVID-related diarrhea. Mytesi is also in development for other possible follow-on indications, including orphan drug indications for symptomatic relief of diarrhea in infants and children with CDD and for adult and pediatric patients with SBS; and for supportive care for diarrhea relief in IBD; IBS-D; and for idiopathic/functional diarrhea. With regard to Canalevia-CA1, we are focused on the launch of the product in the United States for chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in dogs. In addition, a second-generation proprietary anti-secretory agent is in development for cholera. Mytesi previously received orphan-drug designation for SBS. Accordingly, our near term prospects, including our ability to generate material product revenue, obtain any new financing if needed to fund our business and operations or enter into potential strategic transactions, will depend heavily on the success of Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1.\nSubstantial time and capital resources have been previously devoted by third parties in the development of crofelemer, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in Mytesi and Canalevia, and the development of the botanical extract used in Equilevia and Neonorm. Both crofelemer and the botanical extract used in Equilevia and Neonorm were originally developed at Shaman Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cShaman\u201d), by certain members of our management team, including Lisa A. Conte, our chief executive officer and president, and Steven R. King, Ph.D., our executive vice president of sustainable supply, ethnobotanical research and intellectual property and secretary. Shaman spent significant development resources before voluntarily filing for bankruptcy in 2001 pursuant to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The rights to crofelemer and the botanical extract used in Equilevia and Neonorm, as well as other intellectual property rights, were subsequently acquired by Napo from Shaman in 2001 pursuant to a court approved sale of assets. Ms. Conte founded Napo in 2001 and was the current interim chief executive officer of Napo and a member of Napo\u2019s board of directors prior to the Merger. While at Napo, certain members of our management team, including Ms. Conte and Dr. King, continued the development of crofelemer. Following the merger of Jaguar and Napo in July 2017, Napo became Jaguar\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary. If we are not successful in the development and commercialization of Mytesi, our business and our prospects will be harmed.\nThe successful development and commercialization of Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1 will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf our ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA and any other regulatory bodies, the safety and efficacy of Canalevia;\n\u25cf our ability and that of our contract manufacturers to manufacture supplies of Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1 and to develop, validate and maintain viable commercial manufacturing processes that are compliant with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, if required;\n\u25cf our ability to successfully market Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u25cf the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of our prescription drug product candidates compared to alternative and competing treatments;\n\u25cf the acceptance of our prescription drug product candidates and non-prescription products as safe and effective by physicians, veterinarians, patients, animal owners and the human and animal health community, as applicable;\n\u25cf our ability to achieve and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to our business; and\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and enforce our intellectual property rights and obtain marketing exclusivity for our prescription drug product candidates and non-prescription products, and avoid or prevail in any third-party patent interference, patent infringement claims or administrative patent proceedings initiated by third parties or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d).\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. Accordingly, we may not be successful in developing or commercializing Mytesi, Neonorm, Equilevia, Canalevia or any of our other potential products. If we are unsuccessful or are significantly delayed in commercializing Mytesi, our business and prospects will be harmed and you may lose all or a portion of the value of your investment in our common stock.\nIf we are not successful in identifying, licensing, developing and commercializing additional product candidates and products, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives could be impaired.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our efforts is focused on the commercial performance of Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1, a key element of our strategy is to identify, develop and commercialize a portfolio of products to serve the gastrointestinal health market. Most of our potential products are based on our knowledge of medicinal plants. Our current focus is primarily on product candidates whose active pharmaceutical ingredient or botanical extract has been successfully commercialized or demonstrated to be safe and effective in human or animal trials. In some instances, we may be unable to further develop these potential products because of perceived regulatory and commercial risks. Even if we successfully identify potential products, we may still fail to yield products for development and commercialization for many reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf competitors may develop alternatives that render our potential products obsolete;\n\u25cf an outside party may develop a cure for any disease state that is the target indication for any of our planned or approved drug products;\n\u25cf potential products we seek to develop may be covered by third-party patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u25cf a potential product may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics\nthat indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n\u25cf a potential product may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u25cf a potential product may not be accepted as safe and effective by physicians, veterinarians, patients, animal owners, key opinion leaders and other decision-makers in the gastrointestinal health market, as applicable.\nWhile we are developing specific formulations, including flavors, methods of administration, new patents and other strategies with respect to our current potential products, we may be unable to prevent competitors from developing substantially similar products and bringing those products to market earlier than we can. If such competing products achieve regulatory approval and commercialization prior to our potential products, our competitive position may be impaired. If we fail to develop and successfully commercialize other potential products, our business and future prospects may be harmed and we will be more vulnerable to any problems that we encounter in developing and commercializing our current potential products.\nMytesi faces significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies, both for its currently approved indication and for planned follow-on indications, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe development and commercialization of products for human gastrointestinal health is highly competitive and our success depends on our ability to compete effectively with other products in the market. During the ongoing commercialization of Mytesi for its currently approved indication, and during the future commercialization of Mytesi for any planned follow-on indications, if such follow-on indications receive regulatory approval, we expect to compete with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that operate in the gastrointestinal space, such as Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Allergan, Inc., Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc., Sebela Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Salix Pharmaceuticals.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors in the human gastrointestinal space have substantially more financial, technical and human resources and greater ability to lower costs of manufacturing and sales and marketing than we do. Many also have more experience in the development, manufacture, regulation and worldwide commercialization of human gastrointestinal health products.\nFor these reasons, we cannot be certain that we and Mytesi can compete effectively.\nWe may be unable to obtain, or obtain on a timely basis, regulatory approval for our existing or future human or animal prescription drug product candidates under applicable regulatory requirements, which would harm our operating results.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of human and animal health products are subject to extensive regulation. We are typically not permitted to market our prescription drug product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of the product from the FDA through the filing of an NDA or NADA, as applicable. To gain approval to market a prescription drug, we must provide the FDA with safety and efficacy data from pivotal trials that adequately demonstrate that our prescription drug product candidates are safe and effective for the intended indications. Likewise, to gain approval to market an animal prescription drug for a particular species, we must provide the FDA with safety and efficacy data from pivotal trials that adequately demonstrate that our prescription drug product candidates are safe and effective in the target species (e.g., dogs, cats or horses) for the intended indications. In addition, we must provide manufacturing data evidencing that we can produce our product candidates in accordance with cGMPs. For the FDA, we must also provide data from toxicology studies, also called target animal safety studies, and in some cases environmental impact data. In addition to our internal activities, we will partially rely on contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), and other third parties to conduct our toxicology studies and for certain other product development activities. The results of toxicology studies, other initial development activities, and/or any previous studies in humans or animals conducted by us or third parties\nmay not be predictive of future results of pivotal trials or other future studies, and failure can occur at any time during the conduct of pivotal trials and other development activities by us or our CROs. Our pivotal trials may fail to show the desired safety or efficacy of our prescription drug product candidates despite promising initial data or the results in previous human or animal studies conducted by others. Success of a prescription drug product candidate in prior animal studies, or in the treatment of humans, does not ensure success in subsequent studies. Clinical trials in humans and pivotal trials in animals sometimes fail to show a benefit even for drugs that are effective because of statistical limitations in the design of the trials or other statistical anomalies. Therefore, even if our studies and other development activities are completed as planned, the results may not be sufficient to obtain a required regulatory approval for a product candidate.\nRegulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny approval of any of our prescription drug product candidates for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf if they disagree with our interpretation of data from our pivotal studies or other development efforts;\n\u25cf if we are unable to demonstrate to their satisfaction that our product candidate is safe and effective for the target indication and, if applicable, in the target species;\n\u25cf if they require additional studies or change their approval policies or regulations;\n\u25cf if they do not approve of the formulation, labeling or the specifications of our current and future product candidates; and\n\u25cf if they fail to approve the manufacturing processes of our third-party contract manufacturers.\nFurther, even if we receive a required approval, such approval maybe for a more limited indication than we originally requested, and the regulatory authority may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for successful commercialization.\nAny delay or failure in obtaining any necessary regulatory approval for the intended indications of our human or animal product candidates would delay or prevent commercialization of such product candidates and would harm our business and our operating results.\nThe results of our earlier studies of Mytesi may not be predictive of the results in any future clinical trials and species-specific formulation studies, respectively, and we may not be successful in our efforts to develop or commercialize line extensions of Mytesi.\nOur human and animal product pipeline includes a number of potential indications of Mytesi, our lead prescription product. The results of our studies and other development activities and of any previous studies in humans or animals conducted by us or third parties may not be predictive of future results of these clinical studies and formulation studies, respectively. Failure can occur at any time during the conduct of these trials and other development activities. Even if our formulation/clinical studies and other development activities are completed as planned, the results may not be sufficient to pursue a particular line extension for Mytesi. Further, even if we obtain promising results from our clinical trials or species-specific formulation studies, as applicable, we may not successfully commercialize any line extension. Because line extensions are developed for a particular market, we may not be able to leverage our experience from the commercial launch of Mytesi in new markets. If we are not successful in developing and successfully commercializing these line extension products, we may not be able to grow our revenue and our business may be harmed.\nDevelopment of prescription drug products is inherently expensive, time-consuming and uncertain, and any delay or discontinuance of our current or future pivotal trials would harm our business and prospects.\nDevelopment of prescription drug products for human and animal gastrointestinal health remains an inherently lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and our development activities may not be successful. We do not\nknow whether our current or planned pivotal trials for any of our product candidates will begin or conclude on time, and they may be delayed or discontinued for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to:\n\u25cf address any safety concerns that arise during the course of the studies;\n\u25cf complete the studies due to deviations from the study protocols or the occurrence of adverse events;\n\u25cf add new study sites;\n\u25cf address any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations; or\n\u25cf reach agreement on acceptable terms with study sites, which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different sites.\nFurther, we may not be successful in developing new indications for Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1, and Neonorm may be subject to the same regulatory regime as prescription drug products in jurisdictions outside the United States. Any delays in completing our development efforts will increase our costs, delay our development efforts and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, factors that may cause a delay in the commencement or completion of our development efforts may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates, which, as described above, would harm our business and prospects.\nWe will partially rely on third parties to conduct our development activities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize our current or future human or animal product candidates on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe will partially rely upon CROs to conduct our toxicology studies and for other development activities. We intend to rely on CROs to conduct one or more of our planned pivotal trials. These CROs are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs or manage the risks associated with their activities on our behalf. We are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the development plans and trial protocols presented to regulatory authorities. Any deviations by our CROs may adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals, subject us to penalties or harm our credibility with regulators. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities also require us and our CROs to comply with regulations and standards, GCPs or GLPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of our studies to ensure that the data and results are scientifically valid and accurate.\nAgreements with CROs generally allow the CROs to terminate in certain circumstances with little or no advance notice. These agreements generally will require our CROs to reasonably cooperate with us at our expense for an orderly winding down of the CROs\u2019 services under the agreements. If the CROs conducting our studies do not comply with their contractual duties or obligations, or if they experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised, we may need to secure new arrangements with alternative CROs, which could be difficult and costly. In such event, our studies also may need to be extended, delayed or terminated as a result, or may need to be repeated. If any of the foregoing were to occur, regulatory approval, if required, and commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed and we may be required to expend substantial additional resources.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for planned follow-on indications of crofelemer, Canalevia or our other product candidates, they may never achieve market acceptance. Further, even if we are successful in the ongoing commercialization of Mytesi and Canalevia, we may not achieve commercial success.\nIf we obtain necessary regulatory approvals for planned follow-on indications of crofelemer or our other product candidates, such products may still not achieve market acceptance and may not be commercially successful. Market acceptance of Mytesi, Canalevia, and any of our other products depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the safety of our products as demonstrated in our target animal studies;\n\u25cf the indications for which our products are approved or marketed;\n\u25cf the potential and perceived advantages over alternative treatments or products, including generic medicines and competing products currently prescribed by physicians or veterinarians, as applicable, and, in the case of animal products, products approved for use in humans that are used extra-label in animals;\n\u25cf the acceptance by physicians, veterinarians, companion animal owners, as applicable, of our products as safe and effective;\n\u25cf the cost in relation to alternative treatments and willingness on the part of physicians, veterinarians, patients and animal owners, as applicable, to pay for our products;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects of our products;\n\u25cf the relative convenience and ease of administration of our products; and\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our sales, marketing and distribution efforts.\nAny failure by Mytesi or Canalevia to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nHuman and animal gastrointestinal health products are subject to unanticipated post-approval safety or efficacy concerns, which may harm our business and reputation.\nThe success of our commercialization efforts will depend upon the perceived safety and effectiveness of human and animal gastrointestinal health products, in general, and of our products, in particular. Unanticipated safety or efficacy concerns can subsequently arise with respect to approved prescription drug products, such as Mytesi, or non-prescription products, such as Neonorm, which may result in product recalls or withdrawals or suspension of sales, as well as product liability and other claims. Any safety or efficacy concerns, or recalls, withdrawals or suspensions of sales of our products could harm our reputation and business, regardless of whether such concerns or actions are justified.\nFuture federal and state legislation may result in increased exposure to product liability claims, which could result in substantial losses.\nUnder current federal and state laws, companion and production animals are generally considered to be the personal property of their owners and, as such, the owners\u2019 recovery for product liability claims involving their companion and production animals may be limited to the replacement value of the animal. Companion animal owners and their advocates, however, have filed lawsuits from time to time seeking non-economic damages such as pain and suffering and emotional distress for harm to their companion animals based on theories applicable to personal injuries to humans. If new legislation is passed to allow recovery for such non-economic damages, or if precedents are set allowing for such recovery, we could be exposed to increased product liability claims that could result in substantial losses to us if successful. In addition, some horses can be worth millions of dollars or more, and product liability for horses may be very high. While we currently have product liability insurance, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover any future product liability claims against us.\nIf we fail to retain current members of our senior management, or to identify, attract, integrate and retain additional key personnel, our business will be harmed.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management, particularly Lisa A. Conte, our president and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of services of any of our key personnel would cause a disruption in our ability to develop our current or future product pipeline and commercialize our products and product candidates. Although we have offer letters with these key members of senior management, such agreements do not prohibit them from resigning at any time. For example, the resignation of our former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Karen Wright, in August 2019, caused us to incur additional expenses and expend resources to ensure a smooth transition with her successor, which diverted management attention away from executing our operational plan during this period. To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified management and other personnel, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and restricted stock units. However, given the volatility in our stock price, it may be more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees, particularly senior management, through grants of stock or stock options. If our share-based compensation ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified management and other personnel could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations and adversely affect the timing or outcomes of our current and planned studies, as well as the prospects for commercializing our products.\nIn addition, competition for qualified personnel in the human gastrointestinal health field is intense because there are a limited number of individuals who are trained or experienced in the field. We will need to hire additional personnel as we expand our product development and commercialization activities. Even if we are successful in hiring qualified individuals, as we are a growing organization, we do not have a track record for integrating and retaining individuals. If we are not successful in identifying, attracting, integrating or retaining qualified personnel on acceptable terms, or at all, our business will be harmed.\nWe are dependent on two suppliers for the raw material used to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Mytesi and Canalevia. The termination of either of these contracts would result in a disruption to product development and our business will be harmed.\nThe raw material used to manufacture Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1 is CPL derived from the Croton lechleri tree, which is found in countries in South America, principally Peru. The ability of our contract suppliers to harvest CPL is governed by the terms of their respective agreements with local government authorities. Although CPL is available from multiple suppliers, we only have contracts with two suppliers to obtain CPL and arrange the shipment to our contract manufacturer. Accordingly, if our contract suppliers do not or are unable to comply with the terms of our respective agreements, and we are not able to negotiate new agreements with alternate suppliers on terms that we deem commercially reasonable, it may harm our business and prospects. The countries from which we obtain CPL could change their laws and regulations regarding the export of the natural products or impose or increase taxes or duties payable by exporters of such products. Restrictions could be imposed on the harvesting of the natural products or additional requirements could be implemented for the replanting and regeneration of the raw material. Such events could have a significant impact on our cost and ability to produce Mytesi, Canalevia-CA1 and anticipated line extensions.\nWe are dependent upon third-party contract manufacturers, both for the supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1, as well as for the supply of finished products for commercialization.\nWe are in negotiations with Indena for the purification of the CPL received from our suppliers into the API used to manufacture Canalevia-CA1 and Mytesi , as well as the botanical extract in Neonorm. Indena has never manufactured either such ingredient to commercial scale. Glenmark is the current manufacturer of crofelemer, the active API in Canalevia-CA1and Mytesi. As announced in October of 2015, we have entered into an agreement with Patheon, a provider of drug development and delivery solutions, under which Patheon provides enteric-coated tablets to us for use in humans and animals. We also may contract with additional third parties for the formulation and supply of finished products, which we will use in our planned studies and commercialization efforts.\nWe are dependent upon our contract manufacturers for the supply of the API in Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1. We currently have sufficient quantities of the API used in Mytesi and Canalevia to support our projected sales efforts. We are working with our contract manufacturers to increase API manufacturing capacity of the API to support the sales forecast for 2022 and beyond. If our contract manufacturer cannot manufacture sufficient quantities of the API in a timely manner, we could suffer losses due to lost sales opportunities. We currently have sufficient quantities of the botanical extract used in Neonorm and Equilevia to support planned commercialization efforts for Neonorm and Equilevia. If we are not successful in reaching agreements with third parties on terms that we consider commercially reasonable for manufacturing and formulation of Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1, or if our contract manufacturer and formulator are not able to produce sufficient quantities or quality of the Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1 API or finished product under their agreements, it could delay our plans and harm our business prospects. For example, as a result of the outbreak in 2020 of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, that originated in Wuhan, China and then spread globally, our suppliers and contract manufacturer could be disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines, or other travel or health-related restrictions or could incur increased costs associated with ensuring the safety and health of their personnel. If our suppliers or contract manufacturer is so affected, our supply chain could be disrupted, our product shipments could be delayed, our costs could be increased and our business could be adversely affected.\nThe facilities used by our third-party contractors are subject to inspections, including by the FDA, and other regulators, as applicable. We also depend on our third-party contractors to comply with cGMPs. If our third-party contractors do not maintain compliance with these strict regulatory requirements, they and we will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for their facilities, which would have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, in some cases, we also are dependent on our third-party contractors to produce supplies in conformity to our specifications and maintain quality control and quality assurance practices and not to employ disqualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve the facilities of our third-party contractors if so required, or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing or formulation facilities, which could result in delays in our ability to develop or commercialize our products, if at all. We and our third-party contractors also may be subject to penalties and sanctions from the FDA and other regulatory authorities for any violations of applicable regulatory requirements. The European Medicines Agency (the \u201cEMA\u201d), employ different regulatory standards than the FDA, so we may require multiple manufacturing processes and facilities for the same product candidate or any approved product. We are also exposed to risk if our third-party contractors do not comply with the negotiated terms of our agreements, or if they suffer damage or destruction to their facilities or equipment.\nIf we are unable to establish sales capabilities on our own or through third parties, we may not be able to market and sell our current or future human products and product candidates, if approved, and generate product or other revenue.\nWe currently have limited sales, marketing or distribution capabilities, and prior to Napo\u2019s launch of Mytesi for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy, and our launch of Neonorm for pre-weaned dairy calves and Canalevia for chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in dogs, we had no experience in the sale, marketing and distribution of human or animal health products. There are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our potential inability to attract, hire, retain and motivate qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel and effectively oversee a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and entry into adequate arrangements with distributors or other partners would adversely impact the commercialization of Mytesi, and Canalevia-CA1. If we are not successful in commercializing Mytesi and/or Canalevia-CA1, for their respective currently approved or conditionally approved indications or for any potential follow-on indications, either on our own or through one or more distributors, or in generating upfront licensing or other fees, including through the previously announced licensing arrangement between Napo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Napo Therapeutics S.p.A., we may never generate significant revenue and may continue to incur significant losses, which would harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization and may not successfully manage such growth.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 52 employees. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to hire, train, retain, manage and motivate additional employees and to implement and improve our operational, financial and management systems. These demands also may require the hiring of additional senior management personnel or the development of additional expertise by our senior management personnel. If we fail to expand and enhance our operational, financial and management systems in conjunction with our potential future growth, it could harm our business and operating results.\nCanalevia-CA1 and, our animal health prescription drug product candidates, if approved, may be marketed in the United States only in the target animals and for the indications for which they are approved, and if we want to expand the approved animals or indications, it will need to obtain additional approvals, which may not be granted.\nWe may market or advertise Canalevia-CA1 and our animal health prescription drug product candidates are approved by regulatory authorities, only in the specific species and for treatment of the specific indications for which they were approved, which could limit use of the products by veterinarians and animal owners. We intend to develop, promote and commercialize approved products for new animal treatment indications in the future, but we cannot be certain whether or at what additional time and expense we will be able to do so. If we do not obtain marketing approvals for new indications, our ability to expand our animal health business may be harmed.\nUnder the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994, veterinarians are permitted to prescribe extra-label uses of fully approved animal drugs and approved human drugs for animals under certain conditions. While veterinarians may in the future prescribe and use human-approved products or use our products for extra-label uses, we may not promote our animal health products for extra-label uses. We note that extra-label uses are uses for which the product has not received approval. If the FDA determines that any of our marketing activities constitute promotion of an extra-label use, we could be subject to regulatory enforcement, including seizure of any misbranded or mislabeled drugs, and civil or criminal penalties, any of which could have an adverse impact on our reputation and expose us to potential liability. We will continue to spend resources ensuring that our promotional claims for our animal health products and product candidates remain compliant with applicable FDA laws and regulations, including materials we post or link to on our website. For example, in 2012, our Chief Executive Officer received an \u201cuntitled letter\u201d from the FDA while at Napo regarding preapproval promotion statements constituting misbranding of crofelemer, which was then an investigational drug. These statements were included in archived press releases included on Napo\u2019s website. Napo was required to expend time and resources to revise its website to remove the links in order to address the concerns raised in the FDA\u2019s letter.\nThe misuse or extra-label use of Mytesi, Canalevia and our human or animal prescription drug product candidates approved by regulatory authorities, may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages.\nIf our human or animal prescription drug product candidates are approved by regulatory authorities, there may be increased risk of product liability if physicians, veterinarians, patients, animal owners or others, as applicable, attempt to use such products extra-label, including the use of our products for indications or in species for which they have not been approved. Furthermore, the use of an approved human or animal drug such as Mytesi and Canalevia for indications other than those indications for which such products have been approved may not be effective, which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation. If we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any approved human or animal product for extra-label use, such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the gastrointestinal health industry. Any of these events could harm our reputation and our operating results.\nWe may be unable to obtain, or obtain on a timely basis, a renewal of conditional approval for Canalevia-CA1, or to eventually obtain full regulatory approval of Canalevia-CA1, which would harm our operating results.\nOn December 21, 2021, the FDA conditionally approved Canalevia-CA1 (crofelemer delayed-release tablets) for the treatment of CID in dogs under application number 141-552. FDA\u2019s conditional approval allows the Company to legally sell Canalevia-CA1 before proving it meets the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of effectiveness for full approval. The Company may request renewal of the conditional approval annually for up to four more years, for a total of five years of conditional approval. To receive a renewal from FDA, the Company must show active progress toward proving \u201csubstantial evidence of effectiveness\u201d for full approval.\nIf FDA grants all four annual renewals, the Company has up to four-and-a-half years to develop and submit the necessary data to complete the effectiveness requirement. If the Company does not submit all necessary information to support full approval of Canalevia-CA1 by this four-and-a-half-year deadline, the conditional approval terminates immediately. The Company would then be required to stop marketing the drug because it would be considered to be unapproved.\nIf the Company submits the necessary information before the four-and-a-half-year deadline, the conditional approval period runs another six months, for a total of five years, while FDA reviews the application for full approval. The conditional approval automatically terminates five years after the date of the initial conditional approval. If FDA does not fully approve the drug before the five-year termination date, the Company would then have to stop marketing the drug because it would be considered to be unapproved.\nWe may not maintain the benefits associated with MUMS designation, including market exclusivity.\nAlthough we have received MUMS designation for Canalevia-CA1 for the treatment of CID in dogs, we may not maintain the benefits associated with MUMS designation. MUMS designation is a status similar to \u201corphan drug\u201d status for human drugs. When we were granted MUMS designation for Canalevia-CA1 for the indication of CID in dogs, we became eligible for incentives to support the approval or conditional approval of the designated use. This designation does not allow us to commercialize a product until such time as we obtain approval or conditional approval of the product.\nBecause Canalevia-CA1 has received MUMS designation for the identified particular intended use, we are eligible to obtain seven years of exclusive marketing rights upon approval (or conditional approval) of Canalevia-CA1 for that intended use and become eligible for grants to defray the cost of our clinical work. Each designation that is granted must be unique, i.e., only one designation can be granted for a particular API in a particular dosage form for a particular intended use. The intended use includes both the target species and the disease or condition to be treated.\nAt some point, we could lose MUMS designation. The basis for a lost designation can include but is not limited to, our failure to engage with due diligence in moving forward with a non-conditional approval. In addition, MUMS designation may be withdrawn for a variety of reasons such as where the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective, or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the prescription drug product to meet the needs of animals with the rare disease or condition. If this designation is lost, it could have a negative impact on the product and us, which includes but is not limited to, market exclusivity related to MUMS designation, or eligibility for grants as a result of MUMS designation.\nThe market for our human and animal products, and the gastrointestinal health market as a whole, is uncertain and may be smaller than we anticipate, which could lead to lower revenue and harm our operating results.\nIt is very difficult to estimate the commercial potential of any of our human or animal products because the gastrointestinal health market continues to evolve and it is difficult to predict the market potential for our products. The market will depend on important factors such as safety and efficacy compared to other available treatments, changing standards of care, preferences of physicians, as applicable, the willingness of patients, as applicable, to pay for such products, and the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the product development process or after commercial introduction. If the market potential for our human or animal products is less\nthan we anticipate due to one or more of these factors, it could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the willingness of patients to pay for our products may be less than we anticipate, and may be negatively affected by overall economic conditions.\nInsurance coverage for Mytesi for its current approved indication could decrease or end, or Mytesi might not receive insurance coverage for any approved follow-on indications, which could lead to lower revenue and harm our operating results.\nFor its current approved indication, Mytesi is currently reimbursed by almost all of commercial and Medicare insurance plans. Mytesi is currently covered on Medicaid in all 50 states. However, the nature or extent of coverage for Mytesi by any of these plans or programs could change or be terminated, or Mytesi might not receive insurance coverage for any approved follow-on indications. Either outcome could lead to significantly lower revenue and significantly harm our operating results.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions that increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks.\nWe may evaluate various strategic transactions, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses. Any potential acquisitions may entail numerous risks, including increased operating expenses and cash requirements, assimilation of operations and products, retention of key employees, diversion of our management\u2019s attention and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships of the acquired entities. In addition, if we undertake acquisitions, we may issue dilutive securities, assume or incur debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense. Moreover, we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business.\nCertain of the countries in which we plan to commercialize our products in the future are developing countries, some of which have potentially unstable political and economic climates.\nWe may commercialize our products in jurisdictions that are developing and emerging countries. This may expose us to the impact of political or economic upheaval, and we could be subject to unforeseen administrative or fiscal burdens. At present, we are not insured against the political and economic risks of operating in these countries. Any significant changes to the political or economic climate in any of the developing countries in which we operate or plan to sell products either now or in the future may have a substantial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, trading performance and prospects.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies could result in currency transactions losses.\nAs we expand our operations, we expect to be exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. We anticipate that we may commercialize Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1 and its line extensions in jurisdictions outside the United States. As a result, we may also be further affected by fluctuations in exchange rates in the future to the extent that sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We do not currently employ any hedging or other strategies to minimize this risk, although we may seek to do so in the future.\nLaws and regulations governing global trade compliance could adversely impact our business.\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), and the Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d) at the U.S. Department of Commerce, administer certain laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. In addition, engaging in sales activities to foreign governments introduces additional compliance risks, including risks specific to anti-bribery regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and other similar statutory requirements prohibiting bribery and corruption in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering,\npromising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.\nOur international operations subject us to these laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict our business dealings with certain countries, governments, entities, and individuals, and are constantly changing. Further restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations.\nViolations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, or that any businesses that we may acquire have complied with such regulations, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are other gastrointestinal-focused human pharmaceutical companies, and we face competition in the marketplaces in which we operate or plan to operate.\nOur commercial success in the human drug arena remains dependent on maintaining or establishing a competitive position in the market for the current, approved specialty indication of Mytesi as well as for planned Mytesi follow-on indications. In the IBS-D market in particular, several competitors have commercially available products approved for our planned IBS-D indication. The availability of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for any drug candidate we develop. The inability to compete with existing or subsequently introduced drug candidates would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nOur obligations to Streeterville are secured by a security interest in all of Napo\u2019s lechlemer assets, so if we default on those obligations, Streeterville could foreclose on our assets.\nOur obligations under the secured promissory note issued to Streeterville Capital, LLC (\u201cStreeterville\u201d) are secured by a first priority security interest in all existing and future lechlemer technology held by Napo, including intellectual property, as provided in the Security Agreement, dated January 19, 2021 between Napo and Streeterville. As a result, if we default on our obligations under these agreements, Streeterville could foreclose on its security interests and liquidate some or all of these assets, which would harm our plans to develop and commercialize lechlemer, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to reduce or cease operations with respect to lechlemer.\nOur royalty interests require us to make minimum royalty payments, even if we do not sell a sufficient amount of products to cover such payments, which may strain our cash resources.\nSince March 2020, we have sold royalty interests to certain lenders that entitle such lenders to receive future royalties on sales of our products. These royalty interests require us to make minimum royalty payments beginning 2021, even if we do not sell a sufficient amount of product to cover such payments, which may strain our cash resources. The total minimum royalty payments will be $6.0 million in 2022, $18.0 million in 2023, $13.9 million in 2024, $7.10 million 2025, and $3.9 million in 2026.\nFailure in our information technology systems, including by cyber-attacks or other data security incidents, could significantly disrupt our operations.\nOur operations depend, in part, on the continued performance of our information technology systems. Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, phishing attacks and other types of disruptions. We have and continue to experience cyber-attacks of varying degrees.\nOur security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or other vulnerabilities. Such breach or unauthorized access or attempts by outside parties to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data could result in significant legal and financial exposure, and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or sabotage systems change frequently, become more sophisticated, and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Additionally, cyber-attacks could also compromise trade secrets and other sensitive information and result in such information being disclosed to others and becoming less valuable, which could negatively affect our business. Although we have information technology security systems, a successful cybersecurity attack or other data security incident could result in the misappropriation and/or loss of confidential or personal information, create system interruptions, deploy malicious software that attacks our systems, or result in financial losses. It is possible that a cybersecurity attack might not be noticed for some period of time. The occurrence of a cyber security attack or incident could result in business interruptions from the disruption of our information technology systems, or negative publicity resulting in reputational damage with our shareholders and other stakeholders and/or increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. In addition, the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information could expose us or other third-parties to regulatory fines or penalties, litigation and potential liability, or otherwise harm our business.\nThe novel coronavirus global pandemic could adversely impact our business, including our supply chain, clinical trials and commercialization of Mytesi and Canalevia.\nAs a result of the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our supply chain, ongoing and future clinical trials and commercialization of Mytesi and Canalevia. For example, COVID-19 has resulted in increased travel restrictions and the shutdown or delay of business activities in various regions, including certain activities of our contract manufacturers in India and in Italy. To the extent our suppliers and contract manufacturer are unable to comply with their obligations under our agreements with them or they are otherwise unable to deliver or are delayed in delivering raw materials, Mytesi and Canalevia API or finished products to us due to COVID-19, our ability to continue meeting commercial demand for Mytesi and Canalevia in the United States or advancing development of our product candidates may become impaired. Travel restrictions and shutdowns in business operations as a result of the outbreak may also limit our ability to pursue business development activities, including limiting onsite diligence of manufacturing facilities owned or operated by the Company and our contractors.\nSuch travel restrictions and shutdowns in business operations may also adversely impact our commercialization of Mytesi and Canalevia, including limiting the ability of our marketing and sales force to engage with healthcare providers and patient groups, and could result in patients postponing visits to healthcare provider facilities, healthcare providers temporarily closing their offices or restricting patient visits, pharmacies being closed or suffering supply chain disruptions, healthcare provider and/or pharmacy employees being unavailable and general disruptions in the operations of payors, distributors, logistics providers and other third parties that are necessary for Mytesi to be prescribed and reimbursed.\nCOVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which COVID-19, and mutated variants of SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes COVID-19, may impact our business, including our supply chain, clinical trials, commercialization of Mytesi and Canalevia and distribution channels, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the pandemic, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the pandemic.\nLong-term remote work arrangements may adversely affect our business.\nMany of our employees have been working remotely the past year and will continue to do so this year. An extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cyber-security risks, impair the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and impact our ability to manage our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue for recent periods has been received from three customers.\nSubstantially all of our revenue has been derived from three customers. Except for the shelter-in-place mandate, we have not been made aware by our customers if they have experienced other issues arising due to COVID-19 that may materially impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. We will continue to have dialogues with our customers.\nWe are subject to state laws in California that require gender and diversity quotas for boards of directors of public companies headquartered in California.\nIn September 2018, California enacted SB 826, requiring public companies headquartered in California to maintain minimum female representation on their boards of directors as follows: by December 31, 2019, public company boards must have a minimum of one female director; by December 31, 2021, public company boards with five members will be required to have at least two female directors, and public company boards with six or more members will be required to have at least three female directors.\nAdditionally, on September 30, 2020, California enacted AB 979, requiring public companies with principal executive offices in California to each have at least one director from an underrepresented community based on ethnicity and sexual orientation by December 31, 2021. By December 31, 2022, each of these companies will be required to have at least two directors from such underrepresented communities if such company has more than four but fewer than nine directors, or at least three directors from underrepresented communities if the company has nine or more directors.\nOur board of directors currently includes one female director. As a result, we are currently not in compliance with either law. An initial violation of either law can result in a fine from the California Secretary of State in the amount of $100,000, with each subsequent violation resulting in a fine of $300,000. We cannot assure that we can recruit, attract and/or retain qualified members of the board and continue to meet gender and diversity quotas as required by California law, which may cause certain investors to divert their holdings in our securities and expose us to financial penalties and/or reputational harm.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe cannot be certain that our patent strategy will be effective to protect against competition.\nOur commercial success depends in large part on obtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection of our human or animal products, both prescription and non-prescription, our current human or animal product candidates and any future human or animal product candidates, and their respective components, formulations, methods used to manufacture them and methods of treatment, as well as successfully defending our patents and other intellectual property rights against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop unauthorized third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products or our product candidates is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents, trade secrets and other similar intellectual property that cover these activities. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities in time to obtain patent protection on them.\nWe have a portfolio of United States and foreign issued patents and pending applications related to our products and product candidates. We have three issued United States patents listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book for Mytesi. We plan to rely on certain of these issued patents as protection for Canalevia. The strength of patents in the field of pharmaceuticals and animal health involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. We cannot be certain that pending applications will issue as patents. For those patents that are already issued and even if other patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around their claims. If the patents we have are not maintained or their scope is significantly narrowed or if we are not able to obtain issued patents from pending applications, our business and prospects would be harmed.\nThe Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, patent reform legislation enacted in 2011, could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of any patent applications and the enforcement or defense of any patents that issue. The Leahy-Smith Act introduced significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, may affect patent litigation, and switch the U.S. patent system from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system. Under a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally is entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. The USPTO developed regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first-to-file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. Among some of the other changes to the patent laws are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and that provide opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our patents and any other patents that issue, all of which could harm our business and financial condition.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent and, in certain jurisdictions, pending applications, are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our prescription drug products, prescription drug product candidates and non-prescription products, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would harm our business.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, which would be costly, time-consuming and, if successfully asserted against us, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our current or future products and product candidates.\nOur research, development and commercialization activities may infringe or otherwise violate or be claimed to infringe or otherwise violate patents owned or controlled by other parties. There may be patents already issued of which we are unaware that might be infringed by a product or one of our current or future prescription drug product candidates or non-prescription products. Moreover, it is also possible that patents may exist that we are aware of, but that we do not believe are relevant to our current or future prescription drug product candidates or non-prescription products, which could nevertheless be found to block our freedom to market these products. Because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing, there may be\napplications now pending of which we are unaware and which may later result in issued patents that may be infringed by our current or future prescription drug product candidates or non-prescription products. We cannot be certain that our products, current or future prescription drug product candidates or non-prescription products will not infringe these or other existing or future third-party patents. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents.\nTo the extent we become subject to future third-party claims against us or our collaborators, we could incur substantial expenses and, if any such claims are successful, we could be liable to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees if we or our collaborators are found to be willfully infringing a third party\u2019s patents. If a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the human or animal prescription drug or non-prescription product that is the subject of the suit. Even if we are successful in defending such claims, infringement and other intellectual property claims can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and divert management\u2019s attention from our business and operations. As a result of or in order to avoid potential patent infringement claims, we or our collaborators may be compelled to seek a license from a third party for which we would be required to pay license fees or royalties, or both. Moreover, these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain such a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could allow our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Any of these events could harm our business and prospects.\nOur proprietary position depends upon the botanical guidance of our drug approval and patents that are formulation or method-of-use patents, which do not prevent a competitor from using the same human or animal drug for another use.\nComposition-of-matter patents on the API in prescription drug products are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection because such patents provide protection without regard to any particular method of use or manufacture or formulation of the API used. The composition-of-matter patents for crofelemer, the API in Mytesi and Canalevia-CA1, have expired, and the issued patents and applications relevant to our products and product candidates cover methods of use for crofelemer and the botanical extract in Neonorm and Equilevia.\nMethod-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method and formulation patents cover formulations of the API or botanical extract. These types of patents do not prevent a competitor from developing or marketing an identical product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method or from developing a different formulation that is outside the scope of the patented formulation. Moreover, with respect to method-of-use patents, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications or uses for which we may obtain patents, physicians may recommend that patients use our products extra-label, and veterinarians may recommend that animal owners use these products extra-label, or animal owners may do so themselves. Although extra-label use may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful, and third parties may challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents and they may be successful.\nWe intend to rely upon a combination of regulatory exclusivity periods, patents, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to Mytesi, our current prescription drug product candidates, non-prescription products and our development programs.\nIf the breadth or strength of protection provided by any patents, patent applications or future patents we may own, license, or pursue with respect to any of our current or future product candidates or products is threatened, it could threaten our ability to commercialize any of our current or future human or animal product candidates or products. Further, if we encounter delays in our development efforts, the period of time during which we could market any of our current or future product candidates or products under any patent protection we obtain would be reduced.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates or products, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates or products are commercialized. The United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued a patent term extension certificate extending the term of US 7,341,744 by 1075 days under 35 USC 156. With respect to requests for patent term extensions, the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and the FDA, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to patents, or may grant more limited extensions than requested. If this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nEven where laws provide protection or we are able to obtain patents, costly and time-consuming litigation may be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and the outcome of such litigation would be uncertain. Moreover, any actions we may bring to enforce our intellectual property against our competitors could provoke them to bring counterclaims against us, and some of our competitors have substantially greater intellectual property portfolios than we have. To counter infringement or unauthorized use of any patents we may obtain, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate. In addition, if we or one of our future collaborators were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our products, current product candidates, or one of our future products, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace and challenges to validity of patents in certain foreign jurisdictions is common as well. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or lack of statutory subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant material information from the USPTO, or made a materially misleading statement, during prosecution. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a competitor seeking to market a generic form of Mytesi before the expiration of any of the patents listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book for Mytesi could file an ANDA with a certification under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(j)(2)(A)(iv) that each of these patents (except for those which the ANDA filer states it will market only after its expiration) is either invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. We may assert the patents in Hatch-Waxman litigation against the party filing the ANDA to keep the competing product off of the market until the patents expire but there is a risk that we will not succeed. The party filing the ANDA may also counterclaim in the litigation that our patents are not valid or unenforceable, and the court may find one or more claims of our patents invalid or unenforceable. If this occurs, a competing generic product could be marketed prior to expiration of our patents listed in the Orange Book, which would harm our business.\nThird parties may also raise similar validity claims before the USPTO in post-grant proceedings such as ex parte reexaminations, inter partes review, or post-grant review, or oppositions or similar proceedings outside the United States, in parallel with litigation or even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of any future patent protection on one or more of our products or our current or future product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could harm our business. We cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution or other basis for a finding of invalidity. Litigation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be unsuccessful, it could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Finally, we may not be able to prevent, misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nIf we are unable to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information to third parties, our competitive position may be impaired.\nWe also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or for which we have not filed patent applications, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and other elements of our product development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we require all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and endeavor to execute confidentiality agreements with all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology, we cannot be certain that we have executed such agreements with all parties who may have helped to develop our intellectual property or had access to our proprietary information, or that our agreements will not be breached. We cannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. If we are unable to prevent disclosure of our intellectual property to third parties, we may not be able to maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which would harm our business.\nAny disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, and erode our competitive position in our market.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other human or animal pharmaceutical product companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the human and animal health industries involves both technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing patents is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and implemented wide-ranging patent reform legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have or that we might obtain in the future.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could impair our business.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on human and animal drug products, product candidates and non-prescription products throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we may obtain patent protection, but where patent enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued or licensed patents and any future patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to animal health products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our future patents, if any, or patents we have in licensed, or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. Proceedings to enforce our future patent rights, if any, in foreign\njurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nOur business could be harmed if we fail to obtain certain registered trademarks in the United States or in other countries.\nOur registered and pending U.S. trademarks include MYTESI\u00ae, JAGUAR HEALTH\u00ae, the Jaguar Health Logo\u00ae, NAPO\u00ae, Napo Logo\u00ae, Napo Therapeutics, CANALEVIA, CANALEVIA-CA1, CANALEVIA-CA2, EQUILEVIA, NEONORM\u00ae, JAGUAR ANIMAL HEALTH\u00ae, and the Jaguar Animal Health Logo\u00ae. We also own registered and pending applications for the CANALEVIA mark in a number of foreign countries. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections of our trademark applications. If so, we will have an opportunity to respond, but we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, the USPTO and comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions may permit third parties to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. If opposition or cancellation proceedings are filed against any of our trademark applications or any registered trademarks, our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. Moreover, any name we propose to use with our prescription drug product candidates in the United States, including CANALEVIA and CANALEVIA-CA1, must be approved by the FDA, regardless of whether we have registered or applied to register as a trademark. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed prescription drug product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology, pharmaceutical or animal health companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any such claims. Even if we were successful in defending against any such claims, such litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nEven if we receive any of the required regulatory approvals for our current or future prescription drug product candidates and non-prescription products, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and delays.\nIf the FDA or any other regulatory body approves any of our current or future prescription drug product candidates, or if necessary, our non-prescription products, the manufacturing processes, clinical development, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product may be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements could include, but are not limited to, submissions of efficacy and safety and other post-marketing information and reports, establishment registration, and product listing, compliance with new rules promulgated under the FSMA, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs, GLPs and GCPs for any studies that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our contract manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, are reportable events to the FDA and may result in, among other things:\n\u25cf restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, revised labeling, or voluntary or involuntary product recalls;\n\u25cf additional clinical studies, fines, warning letters or holds on target animal studies;\n\u25cf refusal by the FDA, or other regulators to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic collaborators related to the unknown problems, or suspension or\nrevocation of the problematic product\u2019s license approvals;\n\u25cf product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u25cf injunctions and/or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA or other regulatory agency\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or require certain changes to the labeling or additional clinical work concerning safety and efficacy of the product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would harm our business. In addition, failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in significant penalties and delays.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may enter into consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians or veterinarians, who prescribe or recommend our products, once approved. As a result, we may be subject to state, federal and foreign healthcare and/or veterinary medicine laws. If our financial relationships with veterinarians are found to be in violation of such laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties.\nFurther, our commercial supply is regulated by the FDA, which requires regular filings, annual reports, and may include modifications by the Company to our approvals. Failure to gain agreement from the FDA on a timely basis could adversely affect our commercial supply of product.\nLastly, if we obtain conditional approval for our current or future drug product candidates, this conditional approval is renewable annually for five years and may be withdrawn or terminated under certain circumstances either during or at the end of the five-year period. For example, even though we have obtained conditional approval for Canalevia-CA1, if we do not undertake substantial efforts to do additional clinical research each year for the next five years, the FDA could terminate such conditional approval by refusing to renew the conditional approval.\nAny of our current or future prescription drug product candidates or non-prescription products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we would be required to report to regulatory authorities and, if we fail to do so, we could be subject to sanctions that would harm our business.\nIf we are successful in commercializing any of our current or future prescription drug product candidates or non-prescription products, certain regulatory authorities will require that we report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if such event is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the regulatory authorities could take action including, but not limited to, criminal prosecution, seizure of our products, facility inspections, removal of our products from the market, recalls of certain lots or batches, or cause a delay in approval or clearance of future products.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms with respect to animal health may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of any of our current or future product candidates and to produce, market, and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in the U.S. Congress or other jurisdictions in which we intend to operate that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products. In addition, the FDA\u2019s regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA and such other regulators in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products and product candidates. Similar changes in laws or regulations can occur in other countries. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations in the United States or in other countries may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any of our current or future products and product candidates. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u25cf changes to manufacturing methods;\n\u25cf additional clinical trials or testing;\n\u25cf new requirements related to approval to enter the market;\n\u25cf recall, replacement, or discontinuance of certain products; and\n\u25cf additional record keeping or the development of certain regulatory required hazard identification plans.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could harm our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe believe that our non-prescription products are not subject to regulation by regulatory agencies in the United States, but there is a risk that regulatory bodies may disagree with our interpretation, or may redefine the scope of their regulatory reach in the future, which would result in additional expense and could delay or prevent the commercialization of these products.\nThe FDA retains jurisdiction over all animal prescription drug products however, in many instances, the Federal Trade Commission will exercise primary or concurrent jurisdiction with FDA on non-prescription products as to post marketing claims made regarding the product. On April 22, 1996, the FDA published a statement in the Federal Register, 61 FR 17706, that it believes that the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act (\u201cDSHEA\u201d), does not apply to animal health supplement products, such as our non-prescription products. Accordingly, the FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine only regulates those animal supplements that fall within the FDA\u2019s definition of an animal drug, animal food or animal feed additive. The Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act defines food as \u201carticles used for food or drink for man or other animals and articles used as components of any such article.\u201d Animal foods are not subject to pre-market approval and are designed to provide a nutritive purpose to the animals that receive them. Feed additives are defined as those articles that are added to an animal\u2019s feed or water as illustrated by the guidance documents. Our non-prescription products are not added to food, are not ingredients in food nor are they added to any animal\u2019s drinking water. Therefore, our non-prescription products do not fall within the definition of a food or feed additive. In light of the pronouncement by the FDA that the DSHEA was not intended to apply to animals, the FDA seeks to regulate such supplements as food or food additives depending on the intended use of the product. The intended use is demonstrated by how the article is included in a food, or added to the animals\u2019 intake (i.e., through its drinking water). If the intended use of the product does not fall within the proscribed use making the product a food, it cannot be regulated as a food. There is no intent to make our non-prescription products a component of an animal food, either directly or indirectly. A feed additive is a product that is added to a feed for any reason including the top dressing of an already prepared feed. Some additives, such as certain forage, are deemed to be Generally Recognized as Safe, or GRAS, and therefore, not subject to a feed Additive Petition approval prior to use. However, the\nsubstances deemed GRAS are generally those that are recognized as providing nutrients as a food does. We do not believe that our non-prescription products fit within this framework either. Finally, a new animal drug refers to drugs intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals. Our non-prescription Neonorm Foal and Neonorm Calf products are not intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease and therefore, do not fit within the definition of an animal drug. Additionally, because a previously marketed human formulation of the botanical extract in our non-prescription products was regulated as a human dietary supplement subject to the DSHEA (and not regulated as a drug by the FDA), we do not believe that the FDA would regulate the animal formulation used in our non-prescription products in a different manner. We do not believe that our non-prescription products fit the definition of an animal drug, food or food additive and therefore are not regulated by the FDA at this time.\nHowever, despite many such unregulated animal supplements currently on the market, the FDA may choose in the future to exercise jurisdiction over animal supplement products in which case, we may be subject to unknown regulations thereby inhibiting our ability to launch or to continue marketing our non-prescription products. In the past, the FDA has redefined or attempted to redefine some non-prescription non-feed products as falling within the definition of drug, feed or feed additive and therefore subjected those products to the relevant regulations. We have not discussed with the FDA its belief that the FDA currently does not exercise jurisdiction over our non-prescription products. Should the FDA assert regulatory authority over our non-prescription products, we would take commercially reasonable steps to address the FDA\u2019s concerns, potentially including but not limited to, seeking registration for such products, reformulating such products to further distance such products from regulatory control, or ceasing sale of such products. Further, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, an agency of the USDA, may at some point choose to exercise jurisdiction over certain non-prescription products that are not intended for production animals. We do not believe we are currently subject to such regulation, but could be in the future. If the FDA or other regulatory agencies, such as the USDA, try to regulate our non-prescription products, we could be required to seek regulatory approval for our non-prescription products, which would result in additional expense and could delay or prevent the commercialization of these products.\nEven if we receive the required regulatory approvals for our current or future prescription drug product candidates and non-prescription products, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense.\nIf the FDA or any other regulatory body approves any of our current or future prescription drug product candidates, or if necessary, our non-prescription products, the manufacturing processes, clinical development, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product is subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements could include, but are not limited to, submissions of efficacy and safety and other post-marketing information and reports, establishment registration, and product listing, compliance with new rules promulgated under the FSMA, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs, GLPs and GCPs for any studies that Napo conducts post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our contract manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, are reportable events to the FDA and may result in, among other things:\n\u25cf restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, revised labeling, or voluntary or involuntary product recalls;\n\u25cf additional clinical studies fines, warning letters or holds on studies;\n\u25cf refusal by the FDA, or other regulators to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by Napo or Napo\u2019s strategic collaborators related to the unknown problems, or suspension or revocation of the problematic product\u2019s license approvals;\n\u25cf product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA or other regulatory agency\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or require certain changes to the labeling or require additional clinical work concerning safety and efficacy of the product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would harm our business. In addition, failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in significant penalties.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may enter into consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians, who prescribe or recommend our products, once approved. As a result, we may be subject to state, federal and foreign healthcare laws, including but not limited to anti-kickback laws. If our financial relationships with physicians or veterinarians are found to be in violation of such laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, such as the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. The closing bid price for our common stock must remain at or above $1.00 per share to comply with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid requirement for continued listing. If the closing bid price for our common stock is less than $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, Nasdaq may send us a notice stating that we will be provided a period of 180 days to regain compliance with the minimum bid requirement or else Nasdaq may make a determination to delist our common stock. Our common stock traded for less than $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, and we received notice of this from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC on February 17, 2022. Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been granted a 180 calendar day grace period, or until August 16, 2022, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. The minimum bid price requirement will be met if our common stock has a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180 calendar day grace period. We are diligently working to evidence compliance with the minimum bid requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance or that Nasdaq will grant us a further extension of time to regain compliance, if necessary.\nThe Company may be eligible for additional time to comply if it does not achieve compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by August 16, 2022. In order to be eligible for consideration for such additional time, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement, and must notify Nasdaq in writing of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period.\nThe delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq may make it more difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms in the future. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. Further, if we were to be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock would cease to be recognized as covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. Moreover, there is no assurance that any actions that we take to restore our compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid requirement would stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from falling below the Nasdaq minimum bid price required for continued listing again or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.\nIf we issue all shares available for issuance pursuant to the ATM Agreement, we will have no shares of common stock available for new securities issuances, which may restrict us from accessing additional capital through the sale of new securities.\nOur Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes us to issue up to 150,000,000 shares of voting common stock, 77,053,990 of which are issued and outstanding and 6,634,077 of which are reserved for issuance upon exercise of options, warrants, vesting of RSUs, and shares to consultants as of March 10, 2022. Accordingly, assuming the sale by us under our ATM Agreement at a price of $0.72 per share, which was the closing price of our Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market on January 28, 2022, the maximum amount of shares that we could issue in this offering pursuant to the ATM Agreement without exceeding our total authorized but unissued shares is approximately $68.1 million. If we were to issue the maximum amount of shares in this offering pursuant to the ATM Agreement, we will have no shares of voting common stock available for additional issuances. Our failure to increase our authorized shares may restrict our ability to access additional capital through the sale of new securities, which may harm our financial position and business prospects.\nIf our shares become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain a listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\nThe price of our common stock could be subject to volatility related or unrelated to our operations, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility in the price of our common stock. From January 29, 2021 through January 28, 2022, the share price of our common stock ranged from a high of $10.74 to a low of $0.70. The reason for the volatility in our stock is not well understood and may continue. Factors that may have contributed to such volatility include, but are not limited to, those discussed previously in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this report and others, such as:\n\u25cf delays in the commercialization of Mytesi, Neonorm, Canalevia-CA1, Equilevia or our other current or future prescription drug product candidates and non-prescription products;\n\u25cf any delays in, or suspension or failure of, our current and future studies;\n\u25cf announcements of regulatory approval or disapproval of any of our current or future product candidates or of regulatory actions affecting our company or our industry;\n\u25cf manufacturing and supply issues that affect product candidate or product supply for our studies or commercialization efforts;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in our earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf the payment of licensing fees or royalties in shares of our common stock;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new prescription drug products or product candidates or non-prescription products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, acquisitions or capital commitments;\n\u25cf announcements relating to future development or license agreements including termination of such agreements;\n\u25cf adverse developments with respect to our intellectual property rights or those of our principal collaborators;\n\u25cf commencement of litigation involving us or our competitors;\n\u25cf any major changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u25cf new legislation in the United States relating to the prescription, sale, distribution or pricing of gastrointestinal health products;\n\u25cf product liability claims, other litigation or public concern about the safety of our prescription drug product or product candidates and non-prescription products or any such future products;\n\u25cf market conditions in the human or animal industry, in general, or in the gastrointestinal health sector, in particular, including performance of our competitors;\n\u25cf future issuances of shares of common stock or other securities;\n\u25cf uncertainties related to COVID-19;\n\u25cf general economic conditions in the United States and abroad; and\n\u25cf market speculation regarding\nIn addition, the stock market, in general, or the market for stocks in our industry, in particular, may experience broad market fluctuations, which may adversely affect the market price or liquidity of our common stock. Any sudden decline in the market price of our common stock could trigger securities class-action lawsuits against us. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the time and attention of our management would be diverted from our business and operations. We also could be subject to damages claims if we were found to be at fault in connection with a decline in our stock price.\nA possible \u201cshort squeeze\u201d due to a sudden increase in demand of our common stock that largely exceeds supply may lead to further price volatility in our common stock.\nInvestors may purchase shares of our common stock to hedge existing exposure in our common stock or to speculate on the price of our common stock. Speculation on the price of our common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our common stock available for purchase in the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase our common stock for delivery to lenders of our common stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of our common stock until investors with short exposure are able to purchase additional shares of common stock to cover their short position. This is often referred to as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in shares of our common stock that are not directly correlated to the performance or prospects of our\ncompany and once investors purchase the shares necessary to cover their short position the price of our common stock may decline.\nYou may not be able to resell our common stock when you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider attractive or satisfactory.\nThe listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market exists. Although our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, trading volume in our common stock has been limited and an active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not develop, you may be unable to sell your shares when you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider attractive or satisfactory. The lack of an active market may also adversely affect our ability to raise capital by selling securities in the future, or impair our ability to license or acquire other product candidates, businesses or technologies using our shares as consideration.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our company, or if they issue adverse or misleading opinions regarding us or our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not influence or control the reporting of these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade or provide a negative outlook on our company or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, the price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nYou may be diluted by conversions of outstanding shares of non-voting common stock, exercises of outstanding options and warrants and issuances of securities pursuant to our ATM Agreement.\nAs of March 10, 2022, we had (i) outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 2,327,368 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $9.83 per share, (ii) outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 127,949 shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding inducement options, with a weighted-average exercise price of $4.42 per share, (iii) 563,108 shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants outstanding, with weighted-average exercise price of $7.17, (iv) 465,194 shares of our common stock issuable upon vesting of outstanding RSUs, (v) 38,333 shares of our common stock issuable to third parties upon exercise of those shares, and (vi) 673 shares of our non-voting common stock issuable at an equivalent share of voting common stock. The exercise of such options, warrants, vesting of RSUs, and conversion of the non-voting common stock will result in further dilution of your investment.\nIn addition, you may experience further dilution if we issue common stock in the future, including common stock issued pursuant to our existing At The Market Offering Agreement (the \u201cATM Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the ATM Agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. (\u201cLadenburg\u201d), we may offer and sell up to $75.0 million of our common stock from time to time through Ladenburg as our sales agent. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 2,261,596 shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement for gross proceeds of $3.5 million.\nAs a result of this dilution, you may receive significantly less in net tangible book value than the full purchase price you paid for the shares in the event of liquidation.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment of management.\nOur third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions to include the following:\n\u25cf a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u25cf no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders or be used to deter a possible acquisition of our company;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u25cf the required approval of the holders of at least 75% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or repeal the provisions of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors;\n\u25cf a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u25cf the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u25cf advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nThese provisions could inhibit or prevent possible transactions that some stockholders may consider attractive.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Section 203, a corporation generally may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other exceptions, the board of directors has approved the transaction.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine or (v) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our amended and restated bylaws. This choice-of-forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated bylaws inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the market price of our common stock.\nWe currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth and not to pay any cash dividends on our common stock. Because we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market price of our common stock. We cannot be certain that our common stock will appreciate in price.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nOur initial public offering had a significant, transformative effect on us. Prior to our initial public offering, our business operated as a privately-held company, and we were not required to comply with public reporting, corporate governance and financial accounting practices and policies required of a publicly-traded company. As a publicly-traded company, we incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses compared to historical levels. In addition, new and changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, as well as under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the JOBS Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC and The Nasdaq Capital Market, may result in an increase in our costs and the time that our board of directors and management must devote to our compliance with these rules and regulations. These rules and regulations have substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and diverted management time and attention from our product development and other business activities.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, requires us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm potentially to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have needed to expend time and resources on documenting our internal control over financial reporting so that we are in a position to perform such evaluation when required. As a smaller reporting company (\u201cSRC\u201d), we expect to avail ourselves of the exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. However, we may no longer avail ourselves of this exemption when we cease to be an SRC. When our independent registered\npublic accounting firm is required to undertake an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, the cost of our compliance with Section 404 will correspondingly increase. Our compliance with applicable provisions of Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues as we implement additional corporate governance practices and comply with reporting requirements. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 applicable to us in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company (\u201cSRC\u201d) and a non-accelerated filer, which allows us to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not SRCs or non-accelerated filers, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our Annual Report and our periodic reports and proxy statements and providing only two years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report and our periodic reports. We will remain an SRC so long as (a) the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is less than $250 million or (b) (1) we have less than $100 million in annual revenues and (2) the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is less than $700 million. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on certain or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline.", "PERMNO": 15375, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "JAGX"}
