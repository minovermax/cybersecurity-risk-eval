The following are significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, operating results, industry, financial position, or future financial performance.\nCOMPETITIVE AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS\nWe Face Significant Competition\nWe compete against other providers of advertising, marketing and merchandising products and services, and providers of point-of-purchase and other in-store solutions, as well as other marketing products and services. Competition is based on, among other things, rates, availability of markets, quality of products and services provided and their effectiveness, store coverage and other factors.\nWe face significant competition from News America (which has been sold to Neptune Retail Solutions), the primary provider of at-shelf advertising and promotional signage for a significant majority of retailers. We continue to compete for advertising dollars with News America\u2019s at-shelf advertising and promotional signage offerings. News America has significantly greater market presence and financial resources that can be used to market their products and purchase exclusive access to retailers and CPG manufacturers. Because our competition has continued to develop and extend their exclusive relationships with both our current as well as prospective retailers our revenues and related operations have been adversely affected.\nWe Have Been, and Are, Party to Significant Litigation\nWe were involved in significant litigation with News America between 2003 and 2011. In 2011, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with News America to resolve the antitrust and false advertising lawsuit that had been outstanding for several years.\nIn July 2019, the Company brought suit against News America in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota, alleging violations of federal and state antitrust and tort laws by News America. The complaint alleges that News America has monopolized the national market for third-party in-store advertising and promotion products and services through various wrongful acts designed to harm the Company, its last significant competitor. The suit seeks, among other relief, an injunction sufficient to prevent further antitrust injury and an award of treble damages to be determined at trial for the harm caused to our Company.\nIn August 2019, News America filed an answer and counterclaim. In October 2019, News America moved for a judgment on the pleadings. Management believes that the counterclaim is without merit, and the Company filed a response brief on November 11, 2019. The Company also moved to dismiss the counterclaim. The court heard oral arguments from both parties on January 14, 2020, and subsequently denied both motions. On July 10, 2020 the parties cross-moved for summary judgment on the counterclaim. On December 7, 2020, the Court granted News America\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim in part, requiring Insignia to strike certain allegations from its complaint and finding News America\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs premature.\nFollowing the close of discovery, on August 27, 2021, News America moved for summary judgment on Insignia\u2019s claims. On September 17, 2021, Insignia filed its response opposing summary judgment. On October 1, 2021, News America filed its reply brief. The court cancelled a hearing on the motion originally scheduled for January 26, 2022, and referred the case to mediation. News America\u2019s summary judgment motion remains pending. At this stage of the proceedings, the Company is unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or estimate any potential resulting liability.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nOur Growth Is Dependent on Our Ability to Successfully Develop and Design Solution Offerings that Meet Client Demands\nOur ability to retain, increase and engage our customers and to increase our revenues will depend partially on our ability to create successful solutions and the ability to secure and maintain access to retailer locations that are appealing to CPG manufacturers. We may modify our existing products or develop and introduce new products, including acquired products. If new or enhanced products fail to engage consumers, we may fail to attract or retain customers or to generate sufficient revenues, margins, or other value to justify our investments. As a result, our business may be adversely affected. In the future, we may invest in new products and initiatives to generate revenue, but there is no guarantee these approaches will be successful or have the necessary scale to be profitable.\nWe Face a Number of Risks Associated With Potential Strategic Alternatives\nAs announced in December 2021, we have commenced a formal process to explore strategic options to maximize shareholder value. We intend to use reasonable efforts to identify and evaluate potential transactions. Such activities are accompanied by risks commonly encountered in pursuing and completing such transactions, including, but not limited to, increased expenses associated with the process. Failure to manage the process to a desirable outcome could harm our business, our strategy and our operating results in a material way.\nWe are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities, which could reduce the likelihood of consummating one or more strategic alternatives. We are and will continue to be one of many participants in the pool of companies exploring strategic alternatives. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including special purpose acquisition companies, other public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be competing for similar opportunities or desirable target candidates as us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise, and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we are at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating one or more strategic alternatives.\nWhile we are committed to exploring strategic options to maximize shareholder value, our management remains dedicated to operating our existing business and operations. This and other limitations on time and resources may adversely impact our ability to identify and consummate a successful strategic alternative. No assurances can be given that we will successfully identify and evaluate suitable business opportunities or that we will consummate any transaction. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to negotiate a business combination or other transaction on favorable terms.\nRISKS RELATED TO ECONOMY AND MARKET CONDITIONS\nCPG Manufacturers and Retailers May Be Disproportionately Impacted by Changes in Economic Conditions\nOur revenues are affected by CPG manufacturers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 marketing and advertising spending. Additionally, our revenues and results of operations may be subject to fluctuations based upon general economic conditions inclusive of the dynamic global trade environment. Another economic downturn, whether because of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, may reduce demand or depress pricing for our products and services and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected.\nCurrent and Future Pandemics Are Likely to Impact Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly and adversely impacted our operations and the operations of our CPG customers and retailers as a result of quarantines, illnesses, and travel and logistics restrictions and it is likely to continue to adversely affect our business indefinitely. Our future bookings may be negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors deriving from the COVID-19 response that have impacted or we believe are likely to negatively impact sales and operating results in the future include, but are not limited to: reduced or delayed levels of CPG spending; reduced levels of staffing with our execution partners; limitations on the ability of our employees to perform their work due to illness caused by the pandemic or local, state, or federal orders requiring employees to remain at home; and limitations on the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis.\nWe will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts on our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. We are unable to determine or predict the nature, duration or scope of the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. As a result, the financial impact to our operating results cannot be reasonably estimated; however, it could be material and last for an extended period of time.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nOur Ability to Attract and Retain Key Employees Is Critical to Our Success\nGiven the unique business we operate and the importance of customer relationships to our business, our future success is dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, operational and sales personnel. Competition for talented personnel is intense, and we cannot be certain that we can retain our managerial, operational and sales personnel or that we can attract, assimilate or retain such personnel in the future. Our inability to attract and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe Have Identified Material Weaknesses in Our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the Past Three Years. If We Fail to Establish and Maintain Effective Internal Control over Financial Reporting, We May Not Be Able to Accurately or Timely Report Our Financial Condition or Results of Operations, Which May Adversely Affect Our Business and the Market Price of Our Common Stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, such as the material weaknesses as described below.\nThe Company had a material weakness at December 31, 2020 related to sales tax accounting that was remediated as of December 31, 2021 and had a material weakness at December 31, 2019 related to impairment testing that we performed in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment that was remediated as of December 31, 2020.\nIn connection with the material weakness identified related to sales tax accounting, we restated our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as described in the Explanatory Paragraph and in Note 2 to our annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. The existence of one or more material weaknesses precludes a conclusion by management that a company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nIn response to these identified material weaknesses, our management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, has dedicated significant resources, including the involvement of outside advisors, in efforts to improve our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain effective control over financial reporting in the future, it could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, and our ability to access the capital markets could be limited.\nWe May Not Be Able to Generate Enough Cash or Secure Enough Capital to Execute Our Future Business Plans\nThe Company has experienced net losses and used significant cash in operations in each of the last three years and there is uncertainty regarding our ability to achieve and maintain profitability. Although the Company is continuing to explore strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value and management has taken actions to reduce cash use, we cannot be sure these actions will sufficiently reduce or eliminate future losses. While we believe the Company has adequate cash to meet its liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months, if cash flows from operations together with cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund our operations and any necessary capital expenditures in the longer term, and we are unable to secure alternative sources of financing on terms acceptable to us, then our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.\nWe may pursue debt, equity or other forms of financing to supplement our current capital resources. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend upon a number of factors, including our future performance and financial results, the status of the strategic alternatives exploration process and our pending litigation, and general economic and capital market conditions. We may not be able to maintain adequate capital or raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all, if needed.\nOur Outsourcing Arrangements May Not Yield the Desired Efficiencies Within Our Planned Timeline, If At All\nWe have arrangements with third parties for them to operate certain software applications and significant portions of our information technology infrastructure, as well as most of our production operations that are necessary to conduct our business. We take steps to monitor and regulate the performance of these third parties, but we may not be successful in managing these relationships to achieve the desired outcomes.\nThese outsourcing arrangements make us reliant on third parties to conduct our operations and to satisfy commitments to customers. We are vulnerable to third party failures to satisfy their obligations to us, including as a result of their nonperformance, performance at standards that are not acceptable to us or our customers, changes in their methods of operation or financial condition, and other matters outside of our control. Further, we may not fully realize on a timely basis the anticipated economic and other benefits of the outsourcing projects or other relationships we entered into with these third parties, which could result in substantial costs or other operational or financial problems for the Company.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur Results of Operations Have Been and May Be Subject to Significant Fluctuations\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary in the future due to a wide variety of factors including:\n\u00b7\nthe addition or loss of customers or changes in timing and amount of our customers\u2019 spending with us;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of seasonal events for customers;\n\u00b7\ncosts of evaluating and developing new products, and customers accepting new products;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of additional selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive conditions in our industry; and\n\u00b7\nthe addition or loss of contracts with retailers.\nDue to these factors, our quarterly and annual net sales, expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future and this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nInvestment in Our Stock Could Result in Fluctuating Returns\nDuring 2021, the sale prices of our common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market ranged from a low of $4.76 to a high of $35.50. We believe factors such as the fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results described above, the market\u2019s acceptance of our services and products, the performance of our business relative to market expectations, as well as limited daily trading volume of our stock and general volatility in the securities markets, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations, resulting in changes in the market prices of the stock of many companies, which may not have been directly related to the operating performance of those companies.\nTECHNOLOGY AND CYBERSECURITY RISKS\nWe May be Impacted if Our Information Systems Are Attacked\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks, both internal and outsourced, in connection with a variety of business activities, some of which are managed by third parties. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Insignia and its employees, customers, retailer network and suppliers. The secure operation of these information technology systems and networks, and the processing and maintenance of this data, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats-from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data-are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and products and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain. Establishing systems and processes to address these threats and changes in legal requirements relating to data collection and storage may increase our costs. Should such an attack succeed, it could expose us and our employees, customers, retailer network and suppliers to misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, theft of assets, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions, and breach of privacy, which may require notification under data privacy and other applicable laws. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.", "PERMNO": 76934, "SIC": 7310, "TIC": "ISIG"}
