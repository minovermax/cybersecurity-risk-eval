{"cik": "717806", "company": "UNITED SECURITY BANCSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nMaking or continuing an investment in common stock issued by USBI involves certain risks that you should carefully consider. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties also could adversely affect our business and results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price of your common stock could decline and you could lose all or a part of your investment. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report\non Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of USBI.\nDifficult conditions in the financial services markets may materially and adversely affect the business and results of operations of the Company.\nDramatic declines in the housing market during recent years, along with increasing foreclosures and unemployment, resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs, initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities, caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions, and, in some cases, to fail. This market turmoil and tightening of credit led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility, and widespread reduction of business activity generally. Although conditions have improved, a return of these trends could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Negative market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which may impact our charge-offs and provisions for loan and credit losses. Economic deterioration that affects household and/or corporate incomes could also result in reduced demand for credit or fee-based products and services. These conditions would have adverse effects on us and others in the financial services industry.\nA return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans and/or reduced demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEconomic recession or other economic problems, including those affecting our markets and regions, but also those affecting the U.S. or world economies, could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services. Since the conclusion of the last recession, economic growth has been slow and uneven, and unemployment levels remain high. If economic conditions deteriorate, or if there are negative developments affecting the domestic and international credit markets, the value of our loans and investments may be harmed, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our financial performance, and our financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, although deteriorating market conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, we cannot provide any assurance that we would benefit from any market growth or favorable economic conditions, either in our primary market areas or nationally, even if they do occur.\nAny litigation, regulatory investigations, proceedings, inquiries or changes could have a significant impact on the Company.\nThe financial services industry has experienced unprecedented market value declines caused primarily by the recent recession and real estate market deterioration. As a result of these adverse market conditions, financial institutions now face a heightened risk of litigation, proceedings, inquiries or regulatory changes. Such actions or changes could result in significant costs and thereby adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe banking industry is highly competitive, which could result in loss of market share and adversely affect our business.\nThe Company encounters strong competition in making loans, acquiring deposits and attracting customers for investment services. The Company competes with commercial banks, online banks, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment banking companies, brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries operating in Alabama and elsewhere in various segments of the financial services\nmarket. Many of these competitors, some of which are affiliated with large bank holding companies, have substantially greater resources and lending limits. In addition, many of the Company\u2019s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally-insured banks, and, as a result, may be able to offer certain products and services at a lower cost than the Company is able to offer, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to extensive governmental regulation, and the costs of complying with such regulation could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state laws. We are subject to the regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the ASBD. These regulations are intended primarily to protect depositors, the public and the DIF, and are not intended to protect shareholders. Additionally, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by other regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and state securities and insurance regulators. The Company is subject to changes in federal and state laws, as well as regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles. Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing continuous change, and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. Regulations and laws may be modified at any time, and new legislation may be enacted that could affect the Company. The Company cannot assure you that any changes in regulations or new laws will not adversely the Company\u2019s performance or results of operations. The Company\u2019s regulatory position is discussed in greater detail under \u201cItem 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nGovernmental responses to recent market disruptions may be inadequate and may have unintended consequences.\nIn response to recent market disruptions, legislators and financial regulators have taken a number of steps to stabilize the financial markets. In recent years, these measures have included the enactment and implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the provision of direct and indirect assistance to financial institutions, assistance by the banking regulatory authorities in arranging acquisitions of weakened banks and broker-dealers, implementation of programs by the Federal Reserve to provide liquidity to the commercial paper markets, and the expansion of deposit insurance coverage. More recently, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which provides for sweeping changes to financial sector regulation and oversight, including new substantive authorities and practices in government regulation and supervision, and a restructuring of the regulatory system, including the creation of new federal agencies, offices, and councils.\nAlthough many of these legislative measures and regulatory efforts have been in place for several years, their aggregate effect on the financial markets remains uncertain. Implementation of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act through rulemaking by federal regulatory authorities has resulted in a series of significant changes to the banking industry as a whole, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, the Company competes with a number of financial services companies that are not subject to the same degree of regulatory oversight to which the Company is subject. The impact of the existing regulatory framework and any future changes to it could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to compete with these institutions, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and prospects.\nChanges to the deposit insurance assessment regime could increase the cost to the Bank of holding deposits and thereby adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act changed the method of calculation for FDIC insurance assessments. Under the previous system, the assessment base was domestic deposits minus certain allowable exclusions, such as\npass-through reserve balances. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, assessments for any calculation period are based on the depository institution\u2019s average consolidated total assets, less its average amount of tangible equity, during that period. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement these changes. In addition to changing the assessment base, the final rule defines and limits certain assessment adjustments, such as those based on unsecured debt or brokered deposits. It also creates a new base assessment rate schedule in an attempt to provide more predictable assessment rates to insured financial institutions while collecting approximately the same amount of revenue as under the old rate schedule. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments, and any significant increase in insurance assessments would likely have an adverse effect on the Bank and thereby negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe cost of complying with the regulations and policies of the CFPB could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a new regulatory entity with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has extensive rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to banks and other types of lenders, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. It also has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, like the Bank, are examined for compliance with consumer protection laws by their primary bank regulators, but these regulators defer to the CFPB\u2019s rules and interpretations in evaluating a bank\u2019s compliance with consumer protection laws. Therefore, although the CFPB does not directly supervise the Bank, the actions of the CFPB significantly impact the Bank\u2019s operations.\nThe CFPB has set forth numerous rules and guidance documents since its inception concerning a wide range of consumer protection laws, many of which are directly applicable to the Company\u2019s operations. For example, the CFPB recently imposed new requirements regarding the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans, limitations on the manner in which loan originators may be compensated, mandatory disclosures on documentation given to borrowers, and an obligation on the part of lenders to verify a borrower\u2019s \u201cability to repay\u201d a residential mortgage loan before extending credit, among others. The CFPB likely will continue to make rules relating to consumer protection, and it is difficult to predict which products and services offered by the Company will be subject to these rules or how these rules will be implemented. However, compliance with CFPB regulations likely will result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRapid and significant changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the Company\u2019s performance.\nMost of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and are therefore subject to significant risks from changes in interest rates. The Company\u2019s profitability depends to a large extent on net interest income, and changes in interest rates can impact the Company\u2019s net interest income as well as the valuation of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. The Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by changes in interest rates and the Company\u2019s ability to manage interest rate risks. Changes in market interest rates, changes in the relationships between short-term and long-term market interest rates and changes in the relationships between different interest rate indices can affect the interest rates charged on interest-earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. These differences could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income or a decrease in the Company\u2019s interest rate spread. For a more detailed discussion of these risks and the Company\u2019s management strategies for these risks, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The Company\u2019s net interest margin depends on many factors that are partly or completely out of the Company\u2019s control, including competition, federal economic monetary and fiscal policies and general economic conditions. Despite the implementation of strategies to manage interest rate risks, changes in interest rates may have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe performance of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio is subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates and market conditions.\nChanges in interest rates can negatively affect the performance of most of the Company\u2019s investments. Interest rate volatility can reduce gains or create losses in the Company\u2019s investment portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. Fluctuations in interest rates affect returns on, and the market value of, investment securities. The fair market value of the securities in the Company\u2019s portfolio and the investment income from these securities also fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. The potential effect of these factors is heightened due to the current conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nChanges in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Federal Reserve. The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve include open market operations in United States government securities, changes in the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, particularly in light of the continuing threat of terrorist attacks, the current political unrest in the Middle East and Eastern Europe and the volatile conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally, the Company cannot predict future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand or our business and earnings. Furthermore, the actions of the United States government and other governments in responding to such conditions may result in currency fluctuations, exchange controls, market disruption and other adverse effects.\nIf loan losses are greater than anticipated, the Company\u2019s earnings may be adversely affected.\nAs a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. The Company\u2019s credit risk with respect to its real estate and construction loan portfolio relates principally to the creditworthiness of individuals and the value of the real estate serving as security for the repayment of loans, and the credit risk with respect to its commercial and consumer loan portfolio relates principally to the general creditworthiness of businesses and individuals within the local markets in which the Company operates. The Company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio and provides an allowance for potential loan losses based on a number of factors. The Company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate. However, if estimates, assumptions or judgments used in calculating this allowance are incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses. The actual amount of future provisions for loan losses cannot be determined at this time and may vary from the amounts of past provisions.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability and liquidity may be affected by changes in economic conditions in the areas where the Company\u2019s operations or loans are concentrated.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends to a certain extent on the general economic conditions of the geographic markets served by the Bank and its subsidiaries in the states of Alabama and Mississippi. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s commercial, real estate and construction loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Adverse changes in the economic conditions of the southeastern United States in general or any one or more of these local\nmarkets could negatively impact the financial results of the Company\u2019s banking operations and have a negative effect on profitability. For example, at present, significant unemployment in the timber industry has caused widespread economic distress in many of the areas served by the Company. A continuation of this trend or similar trends in other industries or sectors served by the Company could have a significant negative effect on the profitability of the Company.\nFurther disruptions in the residential real estate market could adversely affect the Company\u2019s performance.\nSince 2008, the residential real estate market in the United States has experienced a variety of unfavorable economic conditions that have adversely affected the performance and market value of the Company\u2019s residential construction and mortgage loans. Across the United States, delinquencies, foreclosures and losses with respect to residential construction and mortgage loans have reached historically high levels and could increase in the future. In addition, housing prices and appraisal values in many markets have not returned to pre-recession levels and are even continuing to decline in some areas. An extended period of flat or declining housing values could result in additional increases in delinquencies and further losses on residential construction and mortgage loans.\nUSBI cannot guarantee that it will pay dividends to shareholders in the future.\nDividends from the Bank are USBI\u2019s primary source of funds for the payment of dividends to its shareholders, and there are various legal and regulatory limits regarding the extent to which the Bank may pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to USBI. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends, as well as USBI\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders, will continue to be subject to and limited by the results of operations of the Bank and by certain legal and regulatory restrictions. Further, any lenders making loans to USBI may impose financial covenants that may be more restrictive than the legal and regulatory requirements with respect to the payment of dividends to shareholders. There can be no assurance as to whether or when USBI may pay dividends to its shareholders.\nExtreme weather could cause a disruption in the Company\u2019s operations, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nSome of the Company\u2019s operations are located in areas near the Gulf of Mexico, a region that is susceptible to hurricanes and other forms of extreme weather. Such weather events could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and have a material adverse effect on its overall results of operations. Further, a hurricane, tornado or other extreme weather event in any of the Company\u2019s market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may adversely impact the value of collateral held by the Company.\nThe Company needs to stay current on technological changes in order to compete and meet customer demands.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. To remain competitive, financial institutions must continuously evaluate changing customer preferences with respect to emerging technologies and develop plans appropriate to address such changes in the most cost-effective manner possible. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and may enable financial institutions to reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success will depend, in part, on its ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and create additional efficiencies in operations.\nWe continually encounter technological change and may have fewer resources than our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements.\nThe banking and financial services industries are undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to enhancing the level of service provided to customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to\nreduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that enhance customer convenience and create additional efficiencies in operations. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements, and we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, which could reduce our ability to effectively compete.\nOur information systems may experience a failure or interruption.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption in the operation of these systems could impair or prevent the effective operation of our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, lending, or other functions. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure or interruption in the operation of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions impacting our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny, civil litigation, and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use information technology in our operations and offer online banking services to our customers, and unauthorized access to our or our customers\u2019 confidential or proprietary information as a result of a cyber-attack or otherwise could expose us to reputational harm and litigation and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. We are under continuous threat of loss due to hacking and cyber-attacks, especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers, our plans to continue to provide internet banking channels, and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers. Therefore, the secure processing, transmission, and storage of information in connection with our online banking services are critical elements of our operations. However, our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other malware, phishing schemes, or other security failures. In addition, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablet PCs, or other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems in order to access our products and services. Our technologies, systems and networks, and our customers\u2019 devices, may become the target of cyber-attacks, electronic fraud, or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary, and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against these threats or to alleviate or investigate problems caused by such threats. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the processing, storage, or transmission of confidential customer information, any breaches or unauthorized access to such information could present significant regulatory costs and expose us to litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent these types of security threats could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation and ability to generate deposits. While we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches to date, we may suffer such losses in the future. The occurrence of any cyber-attack or information security breach could result in potential liability to clients, reputational damage, damage to our competitive position, and the disruption of our operations, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data.\nWe rely on software developed by third-party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on our behalf. These systems include, but are not limited to, general ledger, payroll, employee benefits, loan and deposit processing, and securities portfolio accounting. While we perform a review of controls instituted by the applicable vendors over these programs in accordance with industry standards and perform our own testing of user controls, we must rely on the continued maintenance of controls by these third-party vendors, including safeguards over the security of customer data. In addition, we maintain, or contract with third parties to maintain, daily backups of key processing outputs in the event of a failure on the part of any of these systems. Nonetheless, we may incur a temporary disruption in our ability to conduct business or process transactions, or incur damage to our reputation, if the third-party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. Such a disruption or breach of security may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe internal controls that we have implemented in order to mitigate risks inherent to the business of banking might fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls and procedures that are designed to manage the various risks in our business, including credit risk, operational risk, and interest rate risk. No system of controls, however well-designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. If there were a failure of such a system, or if a system were circumvented, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurities issued by USBI, including its common stock, are not insured.\nSecurities issued by USBI, including its common stock, are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of any bank and are not insured by the DIF maintained by the FDIC or by any other governmental agency or instrumentality, or any private insurer, and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.\nFuture issuances of additional securities could result in dilution of your ownership.\nUSBI may decide from time to time to issue additional securities in order to raise capital, support growth or fund acquisitions. Further, USBI may issue stock options or other stock grants to retain and motivate employees. Such issuances of securities by USBI would dilute the respective ownership interests of USBI shareholders.\nUSBI\u2019s common stock price is volatile, which could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders.\nThe market price of USBI\u2019s common stock has historically been volatile and likely will continue to be volatile. In particular, USBI\u2019s common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and business conditions;\n\u2022\nchanging market conditions in the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nmonetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations and other activities of the government, agencies and similar organizations;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analyst predictions and projections;\n\u2022\ncollectability of loans;\n\u2022\ncost and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings, claims, settlements and judgments;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nannouncements of innovations or new services by the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\nUSBI\u2019s future sales of common stock or other securities; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nDue to these factors, you may not be able to sell your stock at or above the price you paid for it, which could result in substantial losses.\nUSBI\u2019s results of operations depend upon the results of operations of its subsidiaries.\nThere are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of USBI\u2019s subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to USBI. In addition, USBI\u2019s right to participate in any distribution of assets of any of its subsidiaries upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or otherwise will be subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that any of USBI\u2019s claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized.\nThe Company\u2019s performance and results of operations depend in part upon the soundness of other financial institutions.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine investment and banking transactions, as well as the quality and value of the Company\u2019s investments in equity securities and obligations of other financial institutions, could be adversely affected by the actions, financial condition and profitability of such other financial institutions with which the Company transacts, including, without limitation, the FHLBA and the Bank\u2019s correspondent banks. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of shared credits, trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems, losses of depositor, creditor or counterparty confidence in certain institutions and could lead to losses or defaults by other institutions. Any losses, defaults by, or failures of, the institutions with whom the Company transacts could adversely affect the Company\u2019s debt and equity holdings in such other institutions, the Bank\u2019s participation interests in loans originated by other institutions, and the Company\u2019s business, including its liquidity, financial condition and earnings.\nLiquidity risks could affect the Company\u2019s operations and jeopardize its financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the repayment or sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity. The Company\u2019s funding sources include federal funds, purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements, core and non-core deposits, and short- and long-term debt. The Company maintains a portfolio of securities that can be used as a source of liquidity. There are other sources of liquidity available to the Company or the Bank should they be needed, including the ability to acquire additional non-core deposits. USBI may be able, depending upon market conditions, to issue and sell debt securities, and preferred or common securities in public or private transactions. The Company\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize the Company\u2019s activities or on acceptable terms could be impaired by factors that affect the Company specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as further disruption in the financial markets, negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry, continued deterioration in credit markets, or the financial condition, liquidity or profitability of the financial institutions with which the Company transacts.\nThe Company is dependent upon the services of its management team and board of directors, and the unexpected loss of key officers or directors may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nA departure of any of the Company\u2019s executive officers, other key personnel, or directors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations. The community involvement of the Company\u2019s executive officers and directors and the Company\u2019s directors\u2019 diverse and extensive local business relationships are important to the Company\u2019s success. A material change in the composition of the Company\u2019s management team or board of directors could cause the Company\u2019s business to suffer.", "PERMNO": 88384, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FUSB"}
