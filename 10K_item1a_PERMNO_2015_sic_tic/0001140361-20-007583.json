Risk Factors\nBefore you make an investment decision with respect to any of our securities, you should carefully consider all the information we have included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC. In particular, you should carefully consider the risk factors described below and the risks and uncertainties related to \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this annual report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Frontier. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions, may also adversely affect our business and operations. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the balance of this annual report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.\nRisks Related to the Restructuring, Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement in principle in the form of a Restructuring Term Sheet, enter into the Restructuring Support Agreement, comply with the terms of any Restructuring Support Agreement or successfully complete the Restructuring contemplated thereby, creating substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company engaged in discussions with the Unsecured Noteholders with respect to potential deleveraging or restructuring transactions from January 2020 until the expiration of such agreements and corresponding release of certain confidential information on March 27, 2020. These discussions have included negotiations of the terms and conditions of the Restructuring of the existing debt of, existing equity interests in, and certain other obligations of the Company Parties, expected to be set forth in a non-binding Restructuring Term Sheet (Restructuring Term Sheet) and ultimately documented in a binding Restructuring Support Agreement (Restructuring Support Agreement). We have not yet reached an agreement on mutually acceptable terms and conditions with the Unsecured Noteholders regarding a possible transaction. There can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement-in-principle with respect to a Restructuring Term Sheet or successfully negotiate or enter into a Restructuring Support Agreement on the terms set forth in a Restructuring Term Sheet, or at all.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to consummate the Restructuring and to generate sufficient liquidity from the Restructuring to meet our obligations and operating needs. If the Company enters into a Restructuring Term Sheet and a Restructuring Support Agreement, we expect there will be certain material conditions we must satisfy, including the timely satisfaction of specified milestones related to the solicitation of votes to approve a Plan, commencement of Chapter 11 Cases under the Bankruptcy Code, confirmation of a Plan, consummation of a Plan, and the entry of orders relating to any DIP Facility (as defined herein). Our ability to timely complete such milestones required to consummate the Restructuring is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control. These factors, together with the Company\u2019s limited liquidity, recurring losses from operations and accumulated deficit, create substantial doubt about Frontier\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate the Restructuring on the terms set forth in a Restructuring Term Sheet, a Restructuring Support Agreement, or at all, or realize all or any of the expected benefits from the Restructuring.\nSee \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview\u201d and \u201c-(b) Liquidity and Capital Resources-Subsequent Events Related to the Restructuring\u201d and Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Restructuring and the risks related thereto. Refer to \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Recent Developments-Overview-Going Concern\u201d and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and Note 9 for further detail of our debt obligations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe may seek the protection of the Bankruptcy Court, which would subject us to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy and may harm our business and place our equity holders at significant risk of losing all of their investment in the Company.\nIf we seek the protection of the Bankruptcy Court, our operations and ability to develop and execute our business plan, and our ability to continue as a going concern, are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. As such, seeking Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. During any Chapter 11 Cases, our senior management would be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort attending to the Restructuring instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. Bankruptcy Court protection also might make it more difficult to retain management and other employees necessary to the success and growth of our business.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOther significant risks include the following:\n\u25cf our ability to prosecute, confirm and consummate a Plan;\n\u25cf the high costs of bankruptcy and related fees;\n\u25cf the imposition of restrictions or obligations on the Company by regulators related to the bankruptcy;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain sufficient financing to allow us to emerge from bankruptcy and execute our business plan post-emergence;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations; and\n\u25cf the actions and decisions of our debtholders and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 proceedings that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nDelays in Chapter 11 Cases increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.\nAlthough we expect the confirmation of a Plan will be effected through an orderly plan of reorganization, there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement such a Plan. In order for any proposed plan of reorganization to be confirmed, the Bankruptcy Code, in addition to other legal requirements, requires that at least one impaired class of claims votes to accept the plan of reorganization. In order for a class of creditors to approve a plan of reorganization, the plan must be approved by more than one-half of the total number of claim holders and at least two-thirds in claim amount by those who vote within the class. In addition to obtaining the required votes, the requirements for a Bankruptcy Court to approve a plan of reorganization include, among other judicial findings, that:\n\u25cf we acted in accordance with the applicable provisions in the Bankruptcy Code; and\n\u25cf the plan of reorganization has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.\nIn the event there are any impaired classes of claims that do not vote to accept the plan of reorganization, we would have to satisfy the \u201ccram down\u201d requirements of the Bankruptcy Code and show that the plan of reorganization does not unfairly discriminate and is fair and equitable with respect to those classes of claims that did not vote to accept the plan of reorganization.\nFurthermore, we may not be able to obtain approval of a disclosure statement and/or the required votes or the required judicial approval to a Plan promptly, if at all. In such event, a prolonged bankruptcy proceeding could adversely affect our relationships with customers, suppliers, regulators and employees, among other parties, which in turn could adversely affect our business, competitive position, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and our ability to continue as a going concern. A weakening of our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could adversely affect our ability to implement a Plan. In addition, if a Plan is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, we may be forced to liquidate our assets.\nIf we pursue any Chapter 11 Cases, it is also possible that the Bankruptcy Court may dismiss the proceeding or otherwise decide to abstain from hearing it on procedural grounds. In addition, the confirmation and effectiveness of a Plan is subject to certain conditions and requirements in addition to those described above that may not be satisfied, and the Bankruptcy Court may conclude that the requirements for confirmation and effectiveness have not been satisfied.\nIf we are unable to enter into a Restructuring Support Agreement or if a Restructuring Support Agreement is terminated, our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan may be materially and adversely affected.\nEven if we are able to reach an agreement-in-principle with respect to a Restructuring Term Sheet, the final terms of the Restructuring Term Sheet would remain subject to documentation in a binding Restructuring Support Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate or enter into a Restructuring Support Agreement on the terms set forth in a Restructuring Term Sheet or at all. If we are unable to enter into a Restructuring Support Agreement, there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully negotiate for an alternative orderly pre-negotiated plan of reorganization.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nFurthermore, we expect any Restructuring Support Agreement will contain a number of termination events, some of which would give any consenting Unsecured Noteholders the right to terminate such Restructuring Support Agreement, which could adversely affect our ability to confirm and consummate a Plan. If a Plan is not consummated, there can be no assurance that we would be able to enter into a new plan or that any new plan would be as favorable to holders of claims as a Plan contemplated by a Restructuring Support Agreement. In addition, any Chapter 11 Cases may become protracted, which could significantly and detrimentally impact our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties.\nWe may not be able to obtain confirmation of the Plan.\nThere can be no assurance that a Plan as outlined in a Restructuring Term Sheet (or any other plan of reorganization) will be approved by the Bankruptcy Court. The success of any reorganization will depend on approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the willingness of existing debt and security holders to agree to the exchange or modification of their interests as outlined in a Plan, and there can be no guarantee of success with respect to a Plan or any other plan of reorganization. For instance, we might receive objections to confirmation of a Plan from various stakeholders in any Chapter 11 Cases. We cannot predict the impact that any objection might have on a Plan or on a Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision to confirm a Plan. Any objection may cause us to devote significant resources in response which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance as to whether we will successfully reorganize and emerge from any Chapter 11 Cases or, if we do successfully reorganize, as to when we would emerge from any Chapter 11 Cases. If we are unable to successfully reorganize, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nOur limited liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business operations.\nWe require certain capital resources in order to operate our business and our limited liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business operations. We are highly leveraged, and a substantial portion of our liquidity needs will arise from debt service on our outstanding indebtedness and from funding the costs of operations, working capital and capital expenditures. Our $850 million revolving credit facility is fully utilized as of the date of filing and our access to capital and debt markets is significantly limited. A number of factors, including but not limited to, losses of customers, pricing pressure from increased competition, lower subsidy and switched access revenues, and the impact of economic conditions may negatively affect our cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had $245 million and $327 million of long-term debt maturing in 2020 and 2021, respectively, excluding interest obligations. In connection with the Restructuring, we expect to enter into a DIP Facility. While we anticipate being able to obtain a DIP Facility, there can be no assurance we can enter into such a facility of the expected terms or at all, nor any assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity from any DIP Facility and other future indebtedness to fund our operations and consummate the Restructuring.\nSee \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview\u201d and \u201c-(b) Liquidity and Capital Resources-Subsequent Events Related to the Restructuring\u201d for more information on the Restructuring and our liquidity. Refer to Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our debt obligations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe terms of our current indebtedness reduce, and the terms of future indebtedness including any DIP Facility, exit facilities and takeback debt may reduce, our operating and financial flexibility, and we may not be able to satisfy our obligations under these or other, future debt arrangements.\nWe are a highly leveraged company and face significant operational and industry challenges. Pressures on our business are resulting in a continued deterioration in revenue and liquidity and there is a lower outlook for our industry as a whole. While we have undertaken initiatives to strengthen our business, we have experienced significant challenges in achieving improvements in revenue and customer trends. We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which amounted to $17.5 billion outstanding at December 31, 2019, of which $5.8 billion was secured. We also have access to an $850 million secured Revolving Credit Facility, the full amount of which was utilized as of December 31, 2019. Our current debt arrangements require that we devote a significant portion of our cash flows to service amounts outstanding under those debt arrangements and comply with a number of restrictive covenants that impose certain operating, financial and other restrictions.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe expect that the terms of any DIP Facility or other future indebtedness (including any exit financing to consummate the Restructuring) would contain a number of restrictive covenants that would impose certain operating and other restrictions. Such covenants may, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to:\n\u25cf incur additional indebtedness, guarantee indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\u25cf create liens;\n\u25cf make certain investments or make other restricted payments;\n\u25cf enter into mergers or consolidations, or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u25cf pay dividends on, or make distributions in respect of, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;\n\u25cf make certain asset sales;\n\u25cf enter into restrictions affecting the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to make distributions, loans or advances to us or other subsidiaries; and\n\u25cf engage in transactions with affiliates.\nIn addition, any DIP Facility or future indebtedness may require us to comply with specified covenants, including financial ratios. These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advance of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt.\nThe negotiations regarding the Restructuring have consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may face increased levels of employee attrition.\nOur management has spent, and will continue to be required to spend, a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the Restructuring. This diversion of attention may have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business, and, as a result, on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the Restructuring is protracted. During the pendency of the Restructuring, our employees will face considerable distraction and uncertainty and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet customer expectations, thereby adversely affecting our business and results of operations. The failure to retain or attract members of our management team and other key personnel could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Likewise, we could experience losses of customers who may be concerned about our ongoing long-term viability.\nWe have elected to defer making interest payments in respect of certain of our senior notes and debentures, which may lead to default under our debt arrangements and which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe elected to defer making the interest payments of approximately $322 million due on March 16, 2020 with respect to certain of our senior notes and approximately $6.8 million due on April 1, 2020 with respect to certain of our debentures. The indentures governing those senior notes and debentures provide for a 60-day grace period prior to the exercise of remedies by holders for defaults related to missed interest payments. If we do not make these interest payments for the notes by May 15, 2020 or if we do not make any required principal payments required under the indentures governing our notes, an event of default would occur under the applicable indentures, which would give the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of principal amount the option to accelerate maturity of the principal, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on such notes. If we do not make these interest payments for the debentures by May 31, 2020 or if we do not make any required principal payments required under the indentures governing our debentures, an event of default would occur under the applicable indentures, which would give the trustee or the holders of at least a majority of the principal amount the option to accelerate maturity of the principal, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on such debentures. This acceleration of our debt could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nFrontier is primarily a holding company and, as a result, we rely on the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our cash needs and service our indebtedness.\nFrontier is primarily a holding company and our principal assets consist of the shares of capital stock or other equity instruments of our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. We cannot assure you that the operating results of our subsidiaries at any given time will be sufficient to make dividends, distributions or other payments to us in order to allow us to make payments on our indebtedness. In addition, the payment of these dividends, distributions and other payments, as well as other transfers of assets, between our subsidiaries and from our subsidiaries to us may be subject to legal, regulatory or contractual restrictions. Some state regulators have imposed, and others may consider imposing on regulated companies, including us, cash management practices that could limit the ability of such regulated companies to transfer cash between subsidiaries or to the parent company. While none of the existing state regulations materially affects our cash management, any changes to the existing regulations or imposition of new regulations or restrictions may materially adversely affect our ability to transfer cash within our consolidated companies.\nIn certain instances, any Chapter 11 Cases may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nFollowing the commencement of any Chapter 11 Cases, upon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert such Chapter 11 Cases to cases under Chapter 7 (Chapter 7) of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in a Plan because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOur capital structure will likely be significantly altered under a Plan or any other plan of reorganization ultimately confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Under fresh-start reporting rules that may apply to us upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair value and our accumulated deficit would be restated to zero. Accordingly, if fresh-start reporting rules apply, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications reported in our historical consolidated financial statements, which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our Board of Directors will likely change significantly.\nUnder a Plan, the composition of our Board of Directors will likely change significantly. Any new directors are likely to have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on our Board of Directors and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of the Company. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past.\nWe expect to make contributions to our pension plan in future years, the amount of which will be impacted by volatility in asset values related to Frontier\u2019s pension plan and/or changes in pension plan assumptions.\nWe made contributions of $166 million and $150 million to our pension plan in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we expect to continue to make contributions in future years. Volatility in our asset values, liability calculations, or returns may impact the costs of maintaining our pension plan and our future funding requirements. Any future material contribution could have a negative impact on our liquidity by reducing cash flows.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSignificant changes in discount rates, rates of return on pension assets, mortality tables and other factors could adversely affect our earnings and equity and increase our pension funding requirements.\nPension costs and obligations are determined using actual results as well as actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the long-term expected return on assets and mortality tables. Other assumptions include salary increases, lump sum payments, and retirement age. Some of these assumptions, such as the discount rate and return on pension assets, are reflective of economic conditions and largely out of our control. Changes in the pension assumptions could adversely affect our earnings, equity and funding requirements.\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our net operating loss and other tax carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had federal net operating loss (NOLs) carryforwards of approximately $1.6 billion and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $9.8 billion. However, our ability to utilize these NOLs to offset taxable income may be limited in the future.\nA corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is typically subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-ownership change NOLs to offset future taxable income. In general, under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC), an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% stockholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). Purchases or sales of our common stock in amounts greater than specified levels could create a limitation on our ability to utilize our NOLs for tax purposes in the future. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOLs could cause U.S. federal and state income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect.\nFurthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our NOLs before they expire. In addition, NOLs incurred in one state generally are not available to offset income earned in a different state and there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited for state tax purposes, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, permits NOL carryovers and carrybacks to offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows NOLs incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the CARES Act, but at present does not expect that the NOL carryback provision of the CARES Act would result in a material cash benefit to us.\nIn an effort to safeguard our NOLs, our Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan in July 2019, under which Frontier\u2019s shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 11, 2019 received one preferred share purchase right for each share of common stock outstanding. Pursuant to the rights plan, if a shareholder (or group) acquires beneficial ownership of 4.9 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Frontier\u2019s common stock without prior approval of our Board of Directors or without meeting certain customary exceptions, the rights would become exercisable and entitle shareholders (other than the acquiring shareholder or group) to purchase additional shares of Frontier at a significant discount and result in significant dilution in the economic interest and voting power of the acquiring shareholder or group. Although the rights plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an \u201cownership change\u201d that could adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the restrictions on transferability in the rights plan will prevent all transfers that could result in an \u201cownership change\u201d.\nWe expect to request that the Bankruptcy Court approve restrictions on certain transfers of our stock to limit the risk of an \u201cownership change\u201d prior to the consummation of our restructuring in any Chapter 11 Cases. In addition, we anticipate that pursuant to a Restructuring Support Agreement, any consenting Unsecured Noteholders will agree not to transfer their shares of Frontier\u2019s stock to the extent doing so would violate the terms of any order entered by the Bankruptcy Court with respect to preservation of NOLs.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe impact of the Restructuring on the Company\u2019s NOLs will depend on whether the Restructuring is structured as (i) a taxable disposition of substantially all of the assets and/or subsidiary stock of the Company, (ii) a recapitalization of the Company, or (iii) some other alternative structure. If structured as a taxable disposition, we anticipate that NOLs of the Company (if any) remaining after the Restructuring will not be available to the Reorganized Company. If structured as a recapitalization, we anticipate that the Company will experience an ownership change, and thus NOLs of the Company (if any) remaining after the Restructuring will be subject to limitation, such that the Reorganized Company may not derive all of the benefits of any such remaining NOLs. While not free from doubt, we expect that the Restructuring will be structured as a taxable disposition, in which case the Company\u2019s NOLs will not be available to the Reorganized Company.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have experienced declining revenues and may experience further declines in our revenues going forward.\nWe have experienced declining revenues as a result of declining voice services revenues, lower switched and nonswitched access revenues and declining video and data services revenues. Such declines have been driven primarily by customer losses, changing technology and consumer behavior (such as wireless displacement of wireline use, e-mail use, instant messaging and increasing use of VoIP), increased competition, regulatory constraints and financial decisions by governmental authorities. There can be no assurances that we will be able to stabilize or increase our revenues in the future. Future declines in our revenues could materially and adversely impact our ability to execute on our business strategy, comply with our financial covenants, repay our debts as they become due, negotiate with third parties or attract and retain employees.\nIf our initiatives to stabilize and improve revenues, profitability and cash flows are unsuccessful, our financial position and results of operations will be negatively and adversely impacted.\n\ufeff\nWe must produce adequate revenues and operating cash flows that, when combined with cash on hand and borrowing under our revolving credit facility and other financings, will be sufficient to service our debt, fund our capital expenditures, pay our taxes, and fund our pension and other employee benefit obligations. We continue to experience revenue declines as compared to prior years.\nIn recent years, we have undertaken programs and initiatives with the objective of improving revenues, profitability, and cash flows by enhancing our operations and customer service and support processes. These programs and initiatives require significant resources and may divert attention from ongoing operations and other strategic initiatives. Despite these efforts, we have experienced significant challenges in achieving improvements in revenue and customer trends. In the second quarter of 2019, we significantly reduced our forecast for the anticipated long-term results of a transformation program and we continue to evolve our operational strategies and priorities. If current and future programs and initiatives are unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.\nWe face intense competition.\nThe communications industry is extremely competitive. Through mergers and various service expansion strategies, service providers are striving to provide integrated solutions both within and across geographic markets. Our competitors include CLECs, internet service providers, wireless companies, OTT, VoIP providers and cable companies, some of which may be subject to less regulation than we are. These entities may provide services competitive with the services that we offer or intend to introduce. For example, our competitors may seek to introduce networks in our markets that are competitive with or superior to our copper-based networks in those markets. We also believe that wireless and cable providers have increased their penetration of various services in our markets. We expect that competition will remain robust. Our revenue and cash flow will be adversely impacted if we cannot reverse our customer losses or continue to provide high-quality services.\nWe cannot predict which of the many possible future technologies, products or services will be important in order to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on the effectiveness of capital expenditure investments in our properties, our marketing efforts, our ability to deliver high quality customer service, our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including a changing regulatory environment that may affect our business and that of our competitors differently, new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, or habits, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors. Increasing competition may reduce our revenues and increase our marketing and other costs as well as require us to increase our capital expenditures and thereby decrease our cash flows.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe may be unable to meet the technological needs or expectations of our customers and may lose customers as a result.\nThe communications industry is subject to significant changes in technology and replacing or upgrading our infrastructure to keep pace with such technological changes could result in significant capital expenditures. If we do not replace or upgrade technology and equipment and manage broadband speeds and capacity as necessary, we may be unable to compete effectively because we will not be able to meet the needs or expectations of our customers.\nIn addition, enhancements to product offerings may influence our customers to consider other service providers, such as cable operators or wireless providers. We may be unable to attract new or retain existing customers from cable companies due to their deployment of enhanced broadband and VoIP technology. In addition, new capacity services for wireless broadband technologies may permit our competitors to offer broadband data services to our customers throughout most or all of our service areas. Any resulting inability to attract new or retain existing customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a material manner.\nSome of our competitors have superior resources, which may place us at a disadvantage.\nSome of our competitors have market presence, engineering, technical, marketing and financial capabilities which are substantially greater than ours. In addition, some of these competitors have significantly less debt and are able to raise capital at a lower cost than we are able to. Consequently, some of these competitors may be able to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly, adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, including leading edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and various types of data science, as well as take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we will be able to. Additionally, the greater brand name recognition of some competitors may require us to price our services at lower levels in order to retain or obtain customers. Finally, the cost advantages and greater financial resources of some of these competitors may give them the ability to reduce their prices for an extended period of time if they so choose. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted if we are not able to effectively compete.\nWeak economic conditions and disruptions in our industry may decrease demand for our services, necessitate increased discounts and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe could be adversely impacted by weak economic conditions or their effects. The economy may be adversely impacted by unforeseen events beyond our control including incidents of actual or threatened terrorism, regional hostilities or instability, unusual weather patterns, natural disasters, political instability and health concerns (including epidemics or pandemics, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic described below), defaults on government debt, significant increases in fuel and energy costs, tax increases and other matters that could reduce discretionary spending, tightening of credit markets and declines in consumer confidence. Downturns in the economy and competition in our markets have in the past, and could in the future, cause some of our customers to reduce or eliminate their purchases of our basic and enhanced voice services, broadband and video services and make it difficult for us to obtain new customers or retain existing customers. In addition, if economic conditions are depressed, our customers may delay or discontinue payment for our services or seek more competitive pricing from other service providers, or we may be required to offer increased discounts in order to retain our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic and public health emergency of international concern. In March 2020, the President of the United States declared a State of National Emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Other countries affected by the outbreak took similar measures. Many jurisdictions, particularly in North America (including the United States), Asia and Europe and several states in which we operate, including California, New York, Connecticut and others, have adopted or are considering laws, rules, regulations or decrees intended to address the COVID-19 outbreak, including implementing travel restrictions, closing non-essential businesses and/or restricting daily activities. In addition, many communities have limited, and are considering to further limit, social mobility and gathering. As the COVID-19 pandemic develops, governments, corporations and other authorities may continue to implement restrictions or policies that adversely impact consumer spending, the economy and our business, operations and stock price.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe ultimate extent and long-term effects of epidemics and other public health crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, to the economy and the Company are difficult to assess or predict. This may include, risks to employee health and safety, risks for the deployment and maintenance of our services (including by limiting our customer support and domiciliary service repairs and installations, among other effects resulting from public health and government measures), reduced sales in impacted geographic locations, inability to meet increased customer demand for broadband services or bandwidth utilization, reduced ability of our suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to us, disruptions in payment processing services, a further decline in the market price of our common stock, a prolonged economic downturn and deterioration of the economy and/or consumer and commercial spending, any of which could adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. For example, certain of our existing customers, including SME customers as well as wholesale customers, are experiencing or will experience material disruptions to their income or businesses and may be unable to satisfy their obligations with us as a result. In addition, the broader impacts of the pandemic on the U.S. economy, including job losses and the impact on capital markets, may result in a decline in consumer spending and negatively impact the demand for our services. Furthermore, given the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 across communities where we have offices, network operations centers, data centers, call centers and retail stores, we have enabled certain of our employees to work from home or not report to a Company location, like many other companies. The extent to which our employees can effectively and efficiently perform their jobs under these circumstances is uncertain. Should this situation persist for a prolonged period of time, it may have an adverse impact on our employees\u2019 ability to carry out their duties, which could negatively impact our operations. Certain jurisdictions have imposed or may impose further restrictions on the movement of people and/or goods, including the temporary closure of factories, businesses and public spaces. Any delay in production or delivery of our products or components made in such jurisdictions by our suppliers due to an extended closure of our supplier\u2019s plants or other restrictions imposed to limit the spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technology, and a disruption or failure of such networks, systems or technology as a result of computer viruses, cyber-attacks, misappropriation of data or other malfeasance, as well as outages, accidental releases of information or similar events, may disrupt our business and materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur information technology networks and infrastructure may be subject to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, cyber-attacks or breaches, employee or third-party error or malfeasance, power outages, communication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events.\nFurther, our network and information systems are subject to various risks related to third parties and other parties we may not fully control. We use encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information, including our business data and customer information. Similarly, we rely on employees in our network operations centers, data centers, call centers and retail stores to follow our procedures when handling sensitive information. While we select our third-party business partners and employees carefully, we do not always control their actions, which could expose us to cyber-security risks. In addition, our customers using our network to access the Internet may become victim to malicious and abusive Internet activities, such as unsolicited mass advertising (or spam), peer-to-peer file sharing, distribution of viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software; these activities could adversely affect our network, result in excessive call volume at our call centers and damage our or our customers\u2019 equipment and data.\nWhile we maintain security measures, disaster recovery plans and business continuity plans for our business and are continuously working to upgrade our existing technology systems and provide employee training around the cyber risks we face, these risks are constantly evolving and are challenging to mitigate. Like many companies, we are the subject of increasingly frequent cyber-attacks. Any unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional release of confidential information or other disruptions could result in misappropriation of our or our customers\u2019 sensitive information; financial loss; reputational harm; increased costs, such as those relating to remediation or future protection; customer dissatisfaction, which could lead to a decline in customers and revenue; and legal claims or proceedings, fines and other liabilities. There can be no assurance that the impact of such incidents would not be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur business is sensitive to continued relationships with and the creditworthiness of our wholesale customers.\nWe have substantial business relationships with other communications carriers for which we provide service. We seek to maintain and grow our business with these customers, however we face competition for this wholesale business. While bankruptcies or insolvency of communications carriers have not had a material adverse effect on our business in recent years, future bankruptcies or insolvencies in the industry could result in the loss of significant customers, as well as cause more price competition and an increased allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. Such bankruptcies and insolvencies may be more likely in the future if economic conditions stagnate. Additionally, the Restructuring may make our business partners less willing to do business with us and could negatively impact our business. As a result, our revenues and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions.\nApproximately 72% of our total employees were represented by unions and were subject to collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 32% of the unionized workforce are covered by collective agreements that expire in 2020 and approximately 37% of the unionized workforce are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2021.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of negotiations of the collective bargaining agreements covering our employees. If we are unable to reach new agreements or renew existing agreements, employees subject to collective bargaining agreements may engage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to provide services. New labor agreements or the renewal of existing agreements may impose significant new costs on us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nIf we are unable to hire or retain key personnel, we may be unable to operate our business successfully.\nOur success will depend in part upon the continued services of our management team. We cannot guarantee that our key personnel will not leave or compete with us. The loss, incapacity or unavailability for any reason of key members of our management team could have a material impact on our business. In addition, the Restructuring may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain management and other key personnel, which could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years we have had a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. We recorded goodwill impairments in 2017, 2018 and 2019, resulting in significant non-cash charges to earnings and reductions in our stockholders\u2019 equity. We impaired the remaining balance of our goodwill in 2019 and cannot assure you that our other intangible assets will not become further impaired in the future.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Frontier monitors relevant circumstances, including general economic conditions, enterprise value EBITDA multiples for other providers of communications services, our overall financial performance, the market prices for our stock, and the potential impact that changes in such circumstances might have on the valuation of Frontier\u2019s goodwill or other intangible assets.\nThe continued decline in the share price of our common stock resulted in triggering events in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Our quantitative assessments in certain quarters indicated that the carrying value of the enterprise exceeded its fair value and, therefore, an impairment existed. We recorded aggregate goodwill impairments totaling $5,725 million, $641 million and $2,748 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In the third quarter of 2019, we impaired the $276 million remaining balance of our goodwill. This impairment and the write down of the balance of our goodwill was largely driven by a lower enterprise valuation utilized in our testing which reflected, among other things, pressures on our business resulting in a continued deterioration in revenue, challenges in achieving improvements in revenue and customer trends, the long-term sustainability of our capital structure, and the lower outlook for our industry as a whole.\nOur other intangible assets consist primarily of our customer base, trade name, and royalty agreement. If these intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we may be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined, which would further reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNegotiations with the providers of content for our video systems may not be successful, potentially resulting in our inability to carry certain programming channels on our FiOS and Vantage brand video systems, which could result in the loss of subscribers. Alternatively, because of the power of some content providers, we may be forced to pay an increasing amount for some content, resulting in higher expenses and lower profitability.\nWe must negotiate with the content owners of the programming that we carry on our multichannel video systems (marketed as FiOS video and Vantage video brands). These content owners are the exclusive provider of the channels they offer. If we are unable to reach a mutually-agreed contract with a content owner, including pricing and carriage provisions, our existing agreements to carry this content may not be renewed, resulting in the blackout of these channels. The loss of content could result in our loss of customers who place a high value on the particular content that is lost. In addition, many content providers own multiple channels. As a result, we typically have to negotiate the pricing for multiple channels rather than one and carry and pay for content that customers do not value, in order to have access to other content that customers do value. Some of our competitors have materially larger scale than we do, and may, as a result, be better positioned than we are in such negotiations. As a result of these factors, the expense of content acquisition may continue to increase, and this could result in higher expenses and lower profitability.\nWe are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.\nWe are party to various legal proceedings, including, from time to time, individual actions, class and putative class actions, and governmental investigations, covering a wide range of matters and types of claims including, but not limited to, general contract disputes, billing disputes, rights of access, taxes and surcharges, consumer protection, advertising, sales and the provision of services, trademark and patent infringement, employment, regulatory, tort, claims of competitors and disputes with carriers. Litigation is subject to uncertainty and the outcome if individual matters is not predictable. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or enter into settlements with governmental or other entities which impose significant financial and business remediation measures.\nWe rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors.\nWe depend on a number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure, including network elements such as digital and internet protocol switching and routing equipment, optical and copper transmission equipment, broadband connectivity equipment, various forms of customer premise equipment, optical fiber, wireless equipment, as well as the software that is used throughout our network to manage traffic, network elements, and other functions critical to our operations. If any of our major suppliers were to experience disruption, supply-chain interruptions, financial difficulties, or other unforeseen problems delivering, maintaining, or servicing these network components on a timely basis, our operations could suffer significantly. For example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may affect the ability of our suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to us and may adversely impact our operations. In addition, due to changes in the communications industry, the suppliers of many of these products and services have been consolidating. In the event it were to become necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement supplies, services, or utilities on economically-attractive terms, on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase costs or cause disruptions in our services.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Oversight\nChanges in federal or state regulations may reduce the switched access charge revenues we receive.\nA portion of Frontier\u2019s total revenues ($102 million, or 1% in 2019 and $121 million, or 1%, in 2018) are derived from switched access charges paid by other carriers for services we provide in originating intrastate and interstate long-distance traffic. Frontier expects a portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from switched access charges paid by these carriers for these services. The rates Frontier can charge for switched access are regulated by the FCC and state regulatory agencies.\nIn 2011, the FCC adopted the 2011 Order regarding Intercarrier Compensation, which is the payment framework that governs how carriers compensate each other for the exchange of voice traffic between carriers. However, the 2011 Order did not resolve all questions on Intercarrier Compensation. The FCC continues to consider the possibility of transitioning originating access rates in the future. We cannot predict when or how the FCC would implement any changes originating access rates, and future reductions in these revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn April 2017, the FCC issued an order that resulted in substantial deregulation in a number of our markets for special access services where the market is determined to be competitive and the transport market nationwide. While some aspects of the 2017 Order were appealed by stakeholders the 8th Circuit issued a decision that upheld the majority of the 2017 Order. The FCC has since reaffirmed the portions of the 2017 Order that were vacated and no party appealed the FCC\u2019s second decision.\nCertain states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to originating intrastate access charges, other intercarrier compensation, and state universal service funds. Although the FCC has pre-empted state jurisdiction on most access charges, many states could consider moving forward with their proceedings. We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or switched access revenues. However, future reductions in our subsidy or switched access revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated variable expenses.\nA portion of Frontier\u2019s revenues are derived from federal and state subsidies, including support under the FCC\u2019s CAF II program. To the extent the federal or any state government reduces such subsidies, or we are not successful in obtaining future subsidies, our operating income could be materially and adversely impacted.\n\ufeff\nOn January 30, 2020, the FCC adopted an order establishing RDOF, the next phase of the CAF program. With this order, the FCC plans to hold two auctions totaling $20.4 billion of support over ten years. In the first auction, the FCC plans to offer up to $16 billion in support over ten years ($1.6 billion annually) for an estimated 6 million locations that lack access to speeds of at least 25/3 Mbps based on the FCC\u2019s current maps. After the FCC updates its maps with more granular broadband availability information, the FCC plans to hold a second auction for any remaining locations with the remaining funding, at least $4.4 billion. Recognizing that the RDOF auction is unlikely to conclude before the end of the sixth year of CAF Phase II support (year-end 2020), the order explains that CAF recipients are entitled to a seventh year of CAF Phase II support through 2021, whether or not they are successful in the RDOF auction. The Commission released a public notice tentatively establishing October 22, 2020, as the date for the RDOF auction and is still soliciting technical details on the mechanics of the auction. While the RDOF has not yet been completely finalized, it could result in a material change in the level of funding that Frontier receives from the FCC under CAF II as early as 2022.\nA portion of Frontier\u2019s total revenues ($365 million, or 4%, in 2019 and $378 million, or 4%, in 2018) are derived from federal and state subsidies for rural and high-cost support, that consists primarily of CAF II support, as well as Federal High Cost support and various state subsidies. Federal subsidies represented approximately 92% of subsidy revenue in 2019 and 93% in 2018, with the remainder being state subsidies. The FCC\u2019s 2011 Order changed how federal subsidies are calculated and disbursed. These changes transitioned the USF (Universal Service Fund), which supported voice services in high-cost areas, to the CAF (Connect America Fund), which supports broadband deployment in high-cost areas. In 2015, we accepted the FCC\u2019s CAF Phase II offer in 29 states, which provides Frontier with annual support through 2020 (since extended under RDOF) in return for our commitment to make broadband available in specified locations. While the timing and implementation of RDOF are still being developed, we expect that the program design will not be as favorable to Frontier as CAF II. We cannot predict the timing or extent to which Frontier will participate in or receive support under the proposed RDOF program and this program could result in a material change in the level of funding that Frontier receives from the FCC under CAF II as early as 2022.\nFrontier is required to contribute to the USF and the FCC allows Frontier to recover these contributions through a USF surcharge on customers\u2019 bills. This surcharge accounted for $221 million of revenue in 2019 and $213 million in 2018.\nFuture reductions in these subsidies, the inability to replace a substantial portion of our CAF II funding, or our inability to recover USF contributions, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nFrontier and our industry will likely remain highly regulated, and we could incur substantial compliance costs that could constrain our ability to compete in our target markets.\nAs an incumbent local exchange carrier, some of the services we offer are subject to significant regulation from federal, state and local authorities. This regulation could impact our ability to change our rates, especially on our basic voice services and our access rates and could impose substantial compliance costs on us. In some jurisdictions, regulation may restrict our ability to expand our service offerings. In addition, changes to the regulations that govern our business may have an adverse effect on our business by reducing the allowable fees that we may charge, imposing additional compliance costs, reducing the amount of subsidies or otherwise changing the nature of our operations and the competition in our industry. At this time, it is unknown how these regulations or changes to these regulations will affect Frontier\u2019s operations or ability to compete in the future.\nFCC rulemakings and state regulatory proceedings, including those relating to intercarrier compensation, universal service and broadband services, could have a substantial adverse impact on our operations.\nOur Internet access offerings could become subject to additional laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the Internet. As the significance of the Internet expands, federal, state and local governments may pass laws and adopt rules and regulations, including those directed at privacy, or apply existing laws and regulations to the Internet (including Internet access services), and related matters are under consideration in both federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies. Although the FCC has pre-empted state jurisdiction on network neutrality and privacy, many states, including California, have considered or are moving forward with legislation on these or other Internet-related issues. Multiple states have taken executive or legislative action directed at reinstating aspects of the FCC\u2019s 2015 Order. We cannot predict whether the outcome of expected or pending challenges to the FCC\u2019s order or subsequent state actions will prove beneficial or detrimental to our competitive position.\nWe are subject to the oversight of certain federal and state agencies that have in the past, and may in the future, investigate or pursue enforcement actions against us relating to consumer protection matters.\nCertain federal and state agencies, including state attorneys general, monitor and exercise oversight related to consumer protection matters, including those affecting the communications industry. Such agencies have in the past, and may in the future, choose to launch an inquiry or investigation of our business practices in response to customer complaints or other publicized customer service issues or disruptions. Such inquiries or investigations could result in reputational harm, enforcement actions, litigation, fines, settlements and/or operational and financial conditions being placed on the company, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTax legislation may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nTax laws are dynamic and continually change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the TCJA. The TCJA makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and imposes limitations on the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate results in a decreased valuation of our deferred tax asset and liabilities.\nMore recently, on March 18, 2020, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCR Act), and on March 27, 2020, the CARES Act were each enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FFCR Act and the CARES Act contain numerous income tax provisions, such as relaxing limitations on the deductibility of interest and the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this legislation on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Future regulatory guidance under the FFCR Act and the CARES Act (as well as under the TCJA) remains forthcoming, and such guidance could ultimately increase or lessen their impact on our business and financial condition. It is also highly possible that Congress will enact additional legislation in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which could have an impact on the Company.\nThe determination of the benefit from (or provision for) income taxes requires complex estimations and significant judgments concerning the applicable tax laws. If in the future any element of tax legislation changes the related accounting guidance for income tax, it could affect our income tax position and we may need to adjust the benefit from (or provision for) income taxes accordingly.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIf we fail to regain and maintain compliance with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq, or if we file for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws, our common stock may be delisted and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and stock price.\nOn December 16, 2019, we were notified by Nasdaq that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Rule 5450(a)(1), as the minimum bid price of our common stock had been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. Under Nasdaq\u2019s rules, the notification of noncompliance had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of Frontier\u2019s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cFTR\u201d. Under Nasdaq\u2019s rules, we were given 180 days, or until June 15, 2020, to achieve compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the minimum bid price of Frontier\u2019s common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days prior to the expiration of the 180-day grace period. Failure to regain compliance during this period could result in delisting. Since we received the notification, our share price has continued to consistently trade under $1.00. Additionally, Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Rules provide that Nasdaq may use its discretionary authority to suspend or terminate the listing of a company that has filed for protection under any provision of the federal bankruptcy laws, even if the company\u2019s securities otherwise meet all enumerated criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq. As such, we expect our common stock would be suspended upon the commencement of any Chapter 11 Cases and delisted thereafter. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(b) Liquidity and Capital Resources-Subsequent Events Related to the Restructuring.\u201d\nIf we are unable to cure any event of noncompliance with any continued listing standard of Nasdaq within the applicable timeframe and other parameters set forth by Nasdaq, if we fail to maintain compliance with certain continued listing standards that do not provide for a cure period, or if Nasdaq exercises its discretionary authority to delist our common stock if we file for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws, it will result in the delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq, which could negatively impact the trading price, trading volume, liquidity, availability of price quotations, news and analyst coverage of, and have other material adverse effects on, our common stock. Additionally, delisting may adversely impact the perception of the Company\u2019s financial condition and cause reputational harm with investors and parties conducting business with the Company. The perceived decreased value of employee equity incentive awards may reduce their effectiveness in encouraging performance and retention. Each of these occurrences, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nContinued volatility and declines in the price of our common stock may have a material adverse effect on our business and stockholders.\nThe closing price of our common stock decreased from $2.45 per share on January 2, 2019 to $0.37 per share on March 27, 2020, and it could decline further. Such volatility and decline could result from a variety of factors, including, among other things, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, concerns about our future prospects, uncertainty associated with the Restructuring, which may include the filing of Chapter 11 Cases, our ability to restructure our debt to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations and operating needs, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or financial condition, new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations impacting our business, the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, broad market fluctuations and general economic conditions and any other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSee \u201c-If we fail to regain and maintain compliance with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq, or if we file for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws, our common stock may be delisted and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and stock price.\u201d\nTrading in our securities is highly speculative and poses substantial risks.\nAny Plan will likely provide that certain holders of our debt will receive 100% of the common equity (the New Common Stock) of the Company or an entity formed to indirectly acquire substantially all of the assets and/or subsidiary stock of the Company as may be contemplated by the Restructuring (the Reorganized Company), subject to dilution by certain permitted management incentive plans. Any Plan will also likely provide that all equity interests of existing equity holders will be extinguished. Even if a Plan is confirmed, the value of any securities that are issued is highly speculative and may not have any value. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-(b) Liquidity and Capital Resources-Subsequent Events Related to the Restructuring.\u201d\nThere is no assurance that an active public trading market will continue, or that there will be an active public trading market for the New Common Stock of the Reorganized Company.\nThere can be no assurance that an active public trading market for our common stock will be sustained, or that there will be an active public trading market for the New Common Stock of the Reorganized Company. If for any reason an active public trading market does not continue, or there is no active public trading market for the New Common Stock of the Reorganized Company, purchasers of the shares of our common stock or the New Common Stock may have difficulty in selling their securities should they desire to do so and the price of our common stock or the New Common Stock may decline.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES", "PERMNO": 23887, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "FTRCQ"}
