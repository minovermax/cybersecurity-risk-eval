{"cik": "1046327", "company": "REALNETWORKS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results, and the trading price of our common stock, could be materially harmed.\nOur business and financial results will be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully implement our growth plan, strategic initiatives, and restructuring efforts.\nBeginning in mid-2012, we have developed a growth plan that involves the launch of at least one major new product in each of our three business units. In tandem with our growth plan, we have embarked upon strategic initiatives intended to simplify and accelerate our operations, and restructuring efforts intended to streamline costs and bring more focus to our businesses. The simultaneous execution of all of these measures is ambitious and we have not attempted to pursue this level of\ntransition in our history. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth plan, strategic initiatives, and restructuring efforts, either in a timely manner or at all, and our failure to do so would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nWe need to successfully introduce and monetize new products and services to sustain and grow our businesses.\nIn order to sustain our current level of business and to implement our growth plan, we must successfully introduce and monetize new products and services. The process of developing new, and enhancing existing, products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and is subject to a number of risks. Providing products and services that are attractive and useful to subscribers and consumers is in part subject to unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, including end-user preferences and competing products and services. Any failure by us to timely respond to or accurately anticipate consumers\u2019 changing needs, emerging technological trends or important changes in the market or competition for products and services that we introduce, or that we plan to introduce, could increase the current rate of decline in our market share or result in the loss of market opportunities. In addition, we must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether the products and services that we are developing will meet the needs of a large enough group of consumers, which may result in no return or a loss on our investments.\nDuring 2013 and 2014, each of our businesses introduced at least one new product or service. In early 2014, our RealPlayer business completed the global launch of RealPlayer Cloud, our integrated video player and cloud service. In November 2013, our Mobile Entertainment business completed its European launch of LISTEN, an application and service for smartphone users featuring ringback tones and other services. LISTEN was launched with T-Mobile in the U.S. in April 2014. In August 2013, our Games business launched GameHouse Casino Plus with the Golden Dreams Sweepstakes feature and, in September 2014, launched Slingo Adventure. To date, we have not generated significant revenue from any of these new products and services. Over the past several quarters, we have invested heavily in the development of these and other new products and enhanced features for such products, and we expect to continue to invest heavily both in further development and in sales and marketing efforts aimed at monetizing these products and services. These investments have and are expected to continue to have a significant negative impact on our cash position and there can be no assurance that our efforts will generate any meaningful revenue. If we are unable to generate sustained interest in these products and services, and therefore drive revenue growth, our financial results will be materially negatively impacted.\nFurthermore, new products and services may be subject to legal challenge. Responding to any such claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, require us to stop distributing or selling, or to redesign our products or services, or to pay damages, any of which could materially harm our operating results and our ability to grow our businesses.\nOur legacy products and services face new and continuing challenges, causing our revenues to materially decline.\nAs we increasingly focus our development and sales and marketing efforts on our newly launched products and services, sales of our legacy products and services have suffered and will continue to suffer. For instance, while the efforts of our RealPlayer team are targeted increasingly towards enhanced development and monetization of our new RealPlayer Cloud product, we have significantly reduced our marketing of SuperPass and have redirected our development resources away from RealPlayer Plus, both of which have resulted in declines in the number of subscribers of those legacy products.\nOur legacy products and services also face continuing market challenges, including the rapid move to smartphones and tablets, and the introduction of new operating systems. We have historically distributed our legacy products and services through desktop computers and feature phones, but the number of people who access similar products and services through smartphones and tablets has increased dramatically in the past several years. There are many challenges involved in developing and marketing products and services for users of smartphones and tablets, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to transition or effectively monetize our legacy products and services to these devices. In addition, our consumer-based products and services have historically been distributed through desktop operating platforms. As new operating systems are introduced or updated for these platforms, we are likely to continue to face difficulties reaching our traditional customer base and other unknown distribution challenges. If we continue to have difficulty transitioning our legacy products and services for use on new devices or updated operating systems, then our revenues will continue to decline and our business could be significantly harmed.\nOur restructuring efforts may not yield the anticipated benefits to our shareholders.\nSince 2012, we have taken steps to restructure and simplify our business and operations. In September 2012, we announced plans to divisionalize our business, which we implemented during the first quarter of 2013, and to significantly reduce operating expenses, in part through a reduction in our workforce that was substantially concluded by the end of the second quarter of 2013. In August 2014, we announced a further reduction in our workforce and related cost reductions. We\ncontinue to assess opportunities to further streamline our operations and make our businesses more efficient. There can be no assurance, however, that our past or future restructuring efforts will be successful. Our business and operations may be harmed to the extent there is customer or employee uncertainty surrounding the future direction of our product and service offerings and strategy for our businesses. Our restructuring activities have included implementing cost-cutting initiatives, which may not lead to future profitability and which could materially impact our ability to compete in future periods. If we are unable to effectively re-align the cost structure of our businesses or streamline and simplify our operations, our stock price may continue to be adversely affected, and we and our shareholders will not realize the anticipated financial, operational and other benefits from such initiatives.\nOur businesses face substantial competitive challenges that may prevent us from being successful in those businesses, and may negatively impact future growth in those businesses.\nMany of our current and potential competitors in our businesses have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, more employees and significantly greater resources than we do. To effectively compete in the markets for our products and services, we may experience the following consequences, any of which would adversely affect our operating results and the trading price of our stock:\n\u2022\nreduced prices or margins,\n\u2022\nloss of current and potential customers, or partners and potential partners who provide content we distribute to our customers,\n\u2022\nchanges to our products, services, technologies, licenses or business practices or strategies,\n\u2022\nlengthened sales cycles,\n\u2022\nindustry-wide changes in content distribution to customers or in trends in consumer consumption of digital media products and services,\n\u2022\npressure to prematurely release products or product enhancements, or\n\u2022\ndegradation in our stature or reputation in the market.\nThe market for mobile entertainment services, including our ringback tones and music on demand solutions, is highly competitive and evolving rapidly, particularly with the growth in the use of smartphones. Increased use of smartphones has resulted in a proliferation of applications and services that compete with our SaaS services and, in many cases, are not dependent upon our carrier customers to make them available to subscribers. Increased competition has in the past resulted in pricing pressure, forcing us to lower the selling price of our services. We expect this pricing pressure to continue to materially harm our operating results and financial condition.\nOur recently launched RealPlayer Cloud product faces competition from other cloud service providers, including some that are firmly established in the marketplace and have access to extensive resources, as well as video sharing services, which include both well known and established companies and entrepreneurial startups. In addition, as we continue to develop this product and expand its reach, we expect to see growing competition from companies offering innovative features for engaging with users' video content. Our RealPlayer software services compete with alternative streaming media playback technologies and audio and video formats which have obtained very broad market penetration. If we are unable to compete successfully, most notably through the development, marketing and monetization of RealPlayer Cloud, our RealPlayer business could continue to decline.\nThe branded services in our Games business compete with other online aggregators and distributors of online, downloadable and social casual PC games. Some of these competitors have high volume distribution channels and greater financial resources than we do. Our Games business also competes with many other smaller companies that may be able to adjust to market conditions, including responding effectively to the growing popularity of casual games on social networks, faster than us. We also face significant price competition in the casual games market, and some of our competitors may be able to lower prices more aggressively than us. We expect competition to continue to intensify in this market from these and other competitors. Our games development studios compete primarily with other developers of online, downloadable, mobile and social casual PC games and must continue to develop popular and high-quality game titles. Our Games business must also continue to execute on opportunities to expand the play of our games on a variety of non-PC platforms, including social networks, in order to maintain our competitive position and to grow the business. If we are unable to slow recent revenue declines or achieve future growth in our revenue, particularly as we continue to invest in social and mobile games as the market for these games continues to rapidly evolve, revenue in our Games business will continue to decline and the business will suffer.\nContracts with our carrier customers subject us to significant risks that could negatively impact our revenue or otherwise harm our operating results.\nWe derive a material portion of our revenue from the SaaS offerings we provide to carriers. Many of our SaaS contracts with carriers provide for revenue sharing arrangements, but we have little control over the pricing decisions of our carrier customers. Furthermore, most of these contracts do not provide for guaranteed minimum payments or usage levels. Because most of our carrier customer contracts are nonexclusive, it is possible that our mobile carrier customers could purchase similar services from third parties and cease to use our services in the future. As a result, our revenue derived under these agreements could be substantially reduced depending on the pricing and usage decisions of our carrier customers. In addition, some of our SaaS contracts require us to incur significant set-up costs prior to the launch of services with a carrier customer. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we reduced our forecast for profitability associated with certain carrier customer contracts for which the total costs exceeded the total revenue we expect to recognize from these contracts, and as a result, we recorded impairment of deferred costs totaling $20.0 million. We may be required to record additional impairments or other charges in future periods related to our carrier customer contracts, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn addition, none of our SaaS contracts with carriers obligates our carrier customers to market or distribute any of our SaaS offerings. Despite the lack of marketing commitments, revenue related to our SaaS offerings is, to a large extent, dependent upon the marketing and promotion activities of our carrier customers. In addition, many of our carrier contracts are short term and allow for early termination by the carrier with or without cause. These contracts are therefore subject to renegotiation of pricing or other key terms that could be adverse to our interests and leave us vulnerable to non-renewal by the carriers. The loss of carrier customers, a reduction in marketing or promotion of our SaaS offerings, or the termination, non-renewal or renegotiation of contract terms that are less favorable to us would result in the loss of future revenues from our SaaS offerings.\nFinally, nearly all of our carrier contracts obligate us to indemnify the carrier customer for certain liabilities and losses incurred by them, including liabilities resulting from third party claims for damages that arise out of the use of our technology. These indemnification terms provide us with certain procedural safeguards, including the right to control the defense of the indemnified party. Pursuant to these indemnifications obligations, we have in the past agreed to control the defense on behalf of certain of our carrier customers related to patent infringement proceedings. In 2013, we settled two such litigation matters. Future claims against which we may be obligated to defend our carrier customers could result in payments that could materially harm our business or our consolidated financial statements.\nA majority of the revenue that we generate in our Mobile Entertainment business segment is dependent upon our relationships with a few customers, and any deterioration of these relationships could materially harm our revenue.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales of our mobile entertainment services to a few of our mobile carrier customers, including SK Telecom, a leading wireless carrier in South Korea, and its affiliates. In the near term, we expect that we will continue to generate a significant portion of our total revenue from these customers. If these customers fail to market or distribute our services or terminate or fail to renew their business contracts with us, or if our relationships with these customers deteriorate in any significant way, we may be unable to replace the affected business arrangements with acceptable alternatives. Failure to maintain our relationships with these customers could have a material negative impact on our revenue.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining and growing our distribution of digital media products.\nMaintaining and growing the distribution of digital media products through our websites and our other distribution channels has historically been important to our business, including growth through the introduction of new products and services distributed through these channels. It is unlikely that consumers will continue to download and use our digital media products consistent with past usage, so we expect that our ability to generate revenue from those products will be continue to be reduced, which could lead to lower than expected adoption of newly introduced products and services. Our inability to maintain continued high volume distribution of our digital media products could also hold back the growth and development of related revenue streams from these market segments, including the distribution of third-party products and sales of our subscription services, and therefore could harm our business and our prospects. Our revenue from the distribution of third-party products will also be negatively impacted if those products are not widely downloaded by consumers, including due to the relative market saturation of such products. Most of our revenue from the distribution of third-party products was historically derived from a single customer, however, that relationship ended during the third quarter of 2014, and we entered into an agreement with a new distribution partner. Our distribution revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, materially negatively impacted by these factors.\nOur operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate, which may contribute to continued weakness in our stock price.\nThe trading price for our common stock has a history of volatility. Although our recent stock price history shows more stability, with a range from $6.00 to $8.38 per share during the 52-week period ended December 31, 2014 it also shows continued weakness. As a result of the rapidly changing markets in which we compete, our operating results may fluctuate from period to period, which may contribute to volatility of our stock price.\nIn past periods, our operating results have been affected by personnel reductions and related restructuring charges, lease exit and related charges, and impairment charges for certain of our equity investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets. In addition to these factors, the general difficulty in forecasting our operating results and metrics could result in actual results that differ significantly from expected results, causing volatility and continued weakness in our stock price.\nCertain of our product and service investment decisions (for example, research and development and sales and marketing efforts) are based on predictions regarding business and the markets in which we compete. Fluctuations in our operating results, particularly when experienced beyond what we expected, could cause the trading price of our stock to fluctuate. Weakness in our operating performance is likely to cause continued weakness in our stock price.\nAny impairment to our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and definite-lived assets could result in a significant charge to our earnings.\nIn accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach, or more frequently in the event of certain indications of possible impairment. We review definite-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit\u2019s market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, a significant sustained decline in our market capitalization and other factors. If we were to determine that an impairment had occurred, we would be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a significant negative, and unpredicted, impact on our financial results. The total carrying value of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and definite-lived assets as of December 31, 2014 was $44 million.\nContinued loss of revenue from our subscription services may continue to harm our operating results.\nOur operating results have been and could continue to be adversely impacted by the loss of subscription revenue related to our legacy services and by the failure to generate revenue related to our new services. Subscribers may cancel their subscriptions to our services for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the services sufficiently or that the service does not provide enough value, a lack of attractive or exclusive content generally or as compared with competitive service offerings, or because customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Revenue from our SuperPass subscription service, for example, has declined in recent periods due to changes in consumer preferences and changes on our part to focus on other products and services we offer, and we expect these trends to continue. For the subscription services we offer, we must continue to obtain compelling digital media content for our video and games services in order to maintain and increase usage and overall customer satisfaction for these products. Our operating results may be negatively impacted if we cannot obtain content for our subscription services on commercially reasonable terms.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet is evolving, and unfavorable developments could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are subject to regulations and laws specific to the marketing, sale and delivery of goods and services over the Internet. These laws and regulations, which continue to evolve, cover taxation, user privacy, data collection and protection, copyrights, electronic contracts, sales procedures, automatic subscription renewals, credit card processing procedures, consumer protections, digital games distribution, broadband Internet access and content restrictions. We cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction, as it is not entirely clear how existing laws and regulations governing issues such as privacy, taxation and consumer protection apply or will be enforced with respect to the products and services we sell through the Internet. Moreover, as Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation and/or enforcement efforts by federal, state and foreign agencies and the prospects for private litigation claims related to our data collection, privacy policies or other e-commerce practices become more likely. In addition, the adoption of any laws or regulations or the imposition of other legal requirements that adversely affect our ability to market, sell, and deliver our products and services could decrease our ability to offer or customer demand for our service offerings, resulting in lower revenue. Future regulations, or changes in laws and regulations or their existing interpretations or applications, could also require us to change our business practices, raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business and result in additional historical or future liabilities for us, resulting in adverse impacts on our business and our operating results.\nAs a consumer-facing business, we receive complaints from our customers regarding our consumer marketing efforts and our customer service practices. Some of these customers may also complain to government agencies, and from time to time, those agencies have made inquiries to us about these practices. In addition, we may receive complaints or inquiries directly from governmental agencies that have not been prompted by consumers. In May of 2012, we resolved an investigation and complaint filed against us by the Washington State Office of the Attorney General, or Washington AG, relating to our consumer marketing practices through the entry of a consent decree filed in King County, Washington Superior Court. While we resolved that matter, we cannot provide assurance that the Washington AG or other governmental agencies will not bring future claims regarding our marketing, or consumer services or other practices.\nGlobal and national economic conditions have in the past and could in the future have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and operations depend significantly on global and national economic conditions. Because consumers may consider the purchase of our digital entertainment products and services to be a discretionary expenditure, their decision whether to purchase our products and services may be influenced by macroeconomic factors that affect consumer spending such as unemployment, access to credit, negative financial news, and declines in income. In addition, our carrier customers and business partners may reduce their business or advertising spending with us in the face of adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as financial market volatility, government austerity programs, tight credit, and declines in asset values.. We have in the past recorded material asset impairment charges due in part to weakness in the global economy, and we may need to record additional impairments to our assets in future periods in the event of renewed weakness and uncertainty in the global or national economy. Accordingly, any significant weakness in the national and/or global economy could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in a negative manner.\nRhapsody could continue to recognize losses, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOn March 31, 2010, we completed the restructuring of our digital audio music service joint venture, Rhapsody America LLC. As a result of the restructuring, we no longer have operational control over Rhapsody and Rhapsody\u2019s operating performance is no longer consolidated with our consolidated financial statements. Rhapsody has generated accounting losses since its inception and we have recognized losses on our investment in the convertible preferred stock of Rhapsody since the restructuring. If Rhapsody continues to incur losses, or if it otherwise experiences a significant decline in its business, we may incur further losses on our investment, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 4, Rhapsody Joint Venture, for details on the liquidation preference on our convertible preferred investment.\nGiven the current proportion of the outstanding equity of Rhapsody that we hold, we need to receive Rhapsody\u2019s unaudited quarterly financial statements and related information in order to timely prepare our quarterly consolidated financial statements and also to report certain of Rhapsody\u2019s financial results, as may be required, in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. In addition, we may be required to include Rhapsody\u2019s annual audited financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K in future periods. As we no longer exert operational control over Rhapsody, we cannot guarantee that Rhapsody will deliver its financial statements and related information to us in a timely manner, or at all, or that the unaudited financial statement information provided by Rhapsody will not contain inaccuracies that are material to our reported results. Any failure to timely obtain Rhapsody\u2019s quarterly financial statements or to include its audited financial statements in our future annual reports on Form 10-K, if required, could cause our reports to be filed in an untimely manner, which would preclude us from utilizing certain registration statements and could negatively impact our stock price.\nThe loss of key personnel, or difficulty recruiting and retaining them, could significantly harm our business or jeopardize our ability to meet our growth objectives.\nOur success depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of certain key executives and employees. We have experienced a significant amount of executive-level turnover in the past several years, which has had and could continue to have a negative impact on our ability to retain key employees. Rob Glaser, our founder, Chairman and initial chief executive officer, resigned as chief executive officer in 2010, was appointed as interim chief executive officer in July 2012, and was named permanent chief executive officer in July 2014. In addition, each member of our executive team is either new to RealNetworks or new to his or her executive position. We cannot provide assurance that we will effectively manage these executive-level transitions, which may impact our ability to retain key executives and employees and which could harm our business and operations to the extent there is customer or employee uncertainty arising from such transitions.\nOur success is also substantially dependent upon our ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled management, technical and sales personnel. Qualified individuals are in high demand and competition for such qualified personnel in our industry, particularly engineering talent, is intense, and we may incur significant costs to attract or retain them. Our ability to attract and retain personnel may also be made more difficult by the uncertainty created by our recent executive-level turnover\nand by our continued restructuring efforts, which have involved reductions in our workforce. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the key personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth.\nAcquisitions and divestitures involve costs and risks that could harm our business and impair our ability to realize potential benefits from these transactions.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have acquired and sold technologies and businesses in the past and expect that we will continue to do so in the future. The failure to adequately manage transaction costs and address the financial, legal and operational risks raised by acquisitions and divestitures of technology and businesses could harm our business and prevent us from realizing the benefits of these transactions. In addition, we may identify and acquire target companies, but those companies may not be complementary to our current operations and may not leverage our existing infrastructure or operational experience, which may increase the risks associated with completing acquisitions.\nTransaction-related costs and financial risks related to completed and potential future purchase or sale transactions may harm our financial position, reported operating results, or stock price. Previous acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization of purchased technology, amortization of acquired identifiable intangible assets and the incurrence of charges for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are reflected in our operating expenses. New acquisitions and any potential additional future impairment of the value of purchased assets, including goodwill, could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results. For example, in 2013 we acquired Slingo, Inc. pursuant to which we recorded $8.0 million of intangible assets and $9.9 million in goodwill, and Muzicall Limited pursuant to which we recorded $5.4 million of intangible assets and $1.3 million in goodwill. In compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or definite-lived assets may not be recoverable, include reduced future revenue and cash flow estimates due to changes in our forecasts, and unfavorable changes to valuation multiples and discount rates due to changes in the market. If we were to conclude that any of these assets were impaired, we would have to recognize an impairment charge that could significantly impact our financial results.\nPurchase and sale transactions also involve operational risks that could harm our existing operations or prevent realization of anticipated benefits from a transaction. These operational risks include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties and expenses in assimilating the operations, products, technology, information systems, and/or personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nretaining key management or employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nentrance into unfamiliar markets, industry segments, or types of businesses;\n\u2022\noperating, managing and integrating acquired businesses in remote locations or in countries in which we have little or no prior experience;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and other resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with employees, affiliates, advertisers or content providers of our business or acquired business; and\n\u2022\nassumption of known and unknown liabilities of the acquired company, including intellectual property claims.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights or leverage our technology assets, and may face risks associated with third-party claims relating to intellectual property rights associated with our products and services.\nOur ability to compete across our businesses partly depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of our technology, including both internally developed technology and technology licensed from third parties. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not assure our ownership rights in our intellectual property, protect or enhance the competitive position of our products and services or effectively prevent misappropriation of our technology. We also routinely receive challenges to our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property that we are using in our business activities in China. Disputes regarding the validity and scope of patents or the ownership of technologies and rights associated with streaming media, digital distribution, and online businesses are common and likely to arise in the future. While we sold to Intel Corporation in 2012 most of our patents, including patents that covered streaming media, we agreed to indemnify Intel for certain third-party infringement claims against these patents up to the purchase price we received in the sale. We may also be forced to litigate, to enforce, or defend our patents and other intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights, enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or redesign our product features and services. Any such dispute would likely be costly and distract our management, and the outcome of any such dispute could fail to improve our business prospects or otherwise harm our business.\nFrom time to time we receive claims and inquiries from third parties alleging that our technology may infringe the third parties\u2019 proprietary rights, especially patents. Third parties have also asserted and most likely will continue to assert claims against us alleging contract breaches, infringement of copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret rights or other proprietary rights, or alleging unfair competition or violations of privacy rights. These claims, even if not meritorious, could force us to spend significant financial and managerial resources. Given the broad distribution of some of our consumer products, any individual claim related to those products could give rise to liabilities that may be material to us. For example, in July 2012, VoiceAge Corporation brought a lawsuit against us alleging breach of our obligation to pay them licensing fees under our patent license agreement with VoiceAge and seeking a material amount in damages. While we settled the dispute with VoiceAge in the fourth quarter of 2013, similar future lawsuits could result in significant legal expenses, monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us that could have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated financial statements. In addition, in 2012 we sold substantially all of our patent assets to Intel. We believe that our patent portfolio may have in the past discouraged third parties from bringing infringement or other claims against us relating to the use of our technologies in our business. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether the sale of these patent assets to Intel will result in additional infringement or other claims against us from third parties.\nOur business and operating results will suffer if our systems or networks fail, become unavailable, unsecured or perform poorly so that current or potential users do not have adequate access to our products, services and websites.\nOur ability to provide our products and services to our customers and operate our business depends on the continued operation and security of our information systems and networks. A significant or repeated reduction in the performance, reliability, security or availability of our information systems and network infrastructure could harm our ability to conduct our business, and harm our reputation and ability to attract and retain users, customers, advertisers and content providers. We have on occasion experienced system errors and failures that caused interruption in availability of products or content or an increase in response time. Problems with our systems and networks could result from our failure to adequately maintain and enhance these systems and networks, natural disasters and similar events, power failures, HVAC failures, intentional actions to disrupt our systems and networks and many other causes. The vulnerability of a large portion of our computer and communications infrastructure is enhanced due to its geographic concentration in Seattle, Washington, an area that is at heightened risk of earthquake, flood, and volcanic events. Many of our services do not currently have fully redundant systems or a formal disaster recovery plan, and we may not have adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur from a system outage.\nThe growth of our business is dependent in part on successfully managing our international operations.\nOur international operations involve risks inherent in doing business globally, including difficulties in managing operations due to distance, language, and cultural differences, local economic conditions, different or conflicting laws and regulations, taxes, and exchange rate fluctuations. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency of the country in which each subsidiary operates. We translate our subsidiaries\u2019 revenues into U.S. dollars in our financial statements, and continued volatility in foreign exchange rates, particularly if the U.S. dollar strengthens against the euro or the Korean won, may result in lower reported revenue or net assets in future periods. Our foreign currency exchange risk management program reduces, but does not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. If we do not effectively manage any of the risks inherent in running our international businesses, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe may be subject to market risk and legal liability in connection with our data collection and data security capabilities.\nMany of our products are interactive Internet applications that by their very nature require communication between a client and server to operate. For example, to provide better consumer experiences and to operate effectively, our products send information, including personally identifiable information, to our servers or servers hosted by third parties. In addition, we sell many of our products and services through online sales transactions directly with consumers, through which we collect and store credit card information. In connection with our direct sales to consumers, we may be the victim of fraudulent transactions, including credit card fraud, which presents a risk to our revenue and potentially disrupts service to our consumers. While we take measures to protect our consumer data, we have experienced unauthorized access to our consumer data in the past, and it is possible that our security controls over consumer data may not prevent future improper access or disclosure of credit card information or personally identifiable information. We have an extensive privacy policy concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data involved in interactions between our client and server products. A security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information (including personally identifiable information) or any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy or existing or new legislation regarding privacy issues could harm our reputation, impact the market for our products and services, subject us to litigation, and require us to expend significant resources to mitigate the breach of security, comply with breach notification laws or address related matters. In addition, we need to maintain compliance with standards of the Payment Card Industry, or PCI, for data security in connection with our use of credit card services for payment.\nIf we fail to maintain the PCI compliance standards we may be subject to substantial monetary penalties and we could lose the ability to accept credit card payments for transactions with our customers. Any of these consequences could materially harm our business or our consolidated financial statements.\nChanges in regulations applicable to the Internet and e-commerce that increase the taxes on the services we provide could materially harm our business and operating results.\nAs Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing taxation by state, local or foreign tax authorities becomes more likely. For example, taxation of electronically delivered products and services or other charges imposed by government agencies may also be imposed. We believe we collect transactional taxes and are compliant and current in all jurisdictions where we believe we have a collection obligation for transaction taxes. Any regulation imposing greater taxes or other fees for products and services could result in a decline in the sale of products and services and the viability of those products and services, harming our business and operating results. A successful assertion by one or more states or foreign tax authorities that we should collect and remit sales or other taxes on the sale of our products or services could result in substantial liability for past sales.\nIn those countries where we have a tax obligation, we collect and remit value added tax, or VAT, on sales of \u201celectronically supplied services\u201d provided to European Union residents. The collection and remittance of VAT subjects us to additional currency fluctuation risks.\nWe may be subject to additional income tax assessments.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, income taxes payable, and net deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical financial statements. An audit or litigation can result in significant additional income taxes payable in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer beneficially owns approximately 36% of our stock, which gives him significant control over certain major decisions on which our shareholders may vote or may discourage an acquisition of us.\nRobert Glaser, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns approximately 36% of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Glaser and his affiliates will have significant influence to:\n\u2022\nelect or defeat the election of our directors;\n\u2022\namend or prevent amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u2022\neffect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\u2022\ncontrol the outcome of any other matter submitted to the shareholders for vote.\nThe stock ownership of Mr. Glaser and his affiliates may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of RealNetworks, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nProvisions of our charter documents, shareholder rights plan, and Washington law could discourage our acquisition by a third party.\nOur articles of incorporation provide for a strategic transactions committee of the board of directors. Without the prior approval of this committee, and subject to certain limited exceptions, the board of directors does not have the authority to:\n\u2022\nadopt a plan of merger;\n\u2022\nauthorize the sale, lease, exchange or mortgage of assets representing more than 50% of the book value of our assets prior to the transaction or on which our long-term business strategy is substantially dependent;\n\u2022\nauthorize our voluntary dissolution; or\n\u2022\ntake any action that has the effect of any of the above.\nMr. Glaser has special rights under our articles of incorporation to appoint or remove members of the strategic transactions committee at his discretion that could make it more difficult for RealNetworks to be sold or to complete another change of control transaction without Mr. Glaser\u2019s consent. RealNetworks has also entered into an agreement providing Mr. Glaser with certain contractual rights relating to the enforcement of our charter documents and Mr. Glaser\u2019s roles and authority within RealNetworks. These rights and his role as Chairman of the Board of Directors, together with Mr. Glaser\u2019s\nsignificant beneficial ownership, create unique potential for concentrated influence of Mr. Glaser over potentially material transactions involving RealNetworks and decisions regarding the future strategy and leadership of RealNetworks.\nWe have adopted a shareholder rights plan, which was amended and restated in December 2008, which provides that shares of our common stock have associated preferred stock purchase rights. The exercise of these rights would make the acquisition of RealNetworks by a third party more expensive to that party and has the effect of discouraging third parties from acquiring RealNetworks without the approval of our board of directors, which has the power to redeem these rights and prevent their exercise.\nWashington law imposes restrictions on some transactions between a corporation and certain significant shareholders. The foregoing provisions of our charter documents, shareholder rights plan, our agreement with Mr. Glaser, and Washington law, as well as our charter provisions that provide for a classified board of directors and the availability of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, could have the effect of making it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. These provisions may therefore have the effect of limiting the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 85576, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "RNWK"}
