{"cik": "910638", "company": "3D SYSTEMS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this Form 10-K that are not statements of historical or current facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include the cautionary statements and risk factors set forth below as well as other statements made in this Form 10-K that may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from historical results or from any future results or projections expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nIn addition to the statements set forth below that explicitly describe risks and uncertainties to which our business and our financial condition and results of operations are subject, readers are urged to consider statements in future or conditional tenses or that include terms such as \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cbelief,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201canticipates\u201d or \u201cplans\u201d that appear in this Form 10-K to be uncertain and forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may include comments as to our beliefs, expectations and projections as to future events and trends affecting our business. Forward-looking statements are based upon our beliefs, assumptions and current expectations concerning future events and trends, using information currently available to us, and are necessarily subject to uncertainties, many of which are outside our control. We assume no obligation, and do not intend, to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law. The factors stated under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d set forth below, as well as other factors, could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected or predicted in forward-looking statements.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those reflected in or suggested by forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement that you read in this Form 10-K reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, financial condition, growth strategy and liquidity. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to individuals acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this discussion. You should specifically consider the factors identified in this Form 10-K, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those referred to in forward-looking statements.\nRisk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material also may impair our business operations, results of operations and financial condition. If any of the risks described below or if any other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material actually occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.\nThe risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements that are intended to provide our current expectations with regard to those risks. There can be no assurance that our current expectations will be met, and our actual results may differ substantially from the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements.\nWe face significant competition in many aspects of our business, which could cause our revenue and gross profit margins to decline. Competition could also cause us to reduce sales prices or to incur additional marketing or production costs, which could result in decreased revenue, increased costs and reduced margins.\nWe compete for customers with a wide variety of producers of equipment and software for models, prototypes, other three-dimensional objects and end-use parts as well as producers of print materials and services for this equipment. Some of our existing and potential competitors are researching, designing, developing and marketing other types of competitive equipment and software, print materials and services. Certain of these competitors may have financial, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources substantially greater than ours.\nWe also expect that future competition may arise from the development of allied or related techniques for equipment and materials that are not encompassed by our patents, from the issuance of patents to other companies that may inhibit our ability to develop certain products, and from improvements to existing print materials and equipment technologies.\nSome of our patents have recently expired and others will expire in coming years. Upon expiration of those patents, our competitors may introduce products using the technology previously protected by the expired patents, which products may have lower prices than those of our products. To compete, we may need to reduce our prices for those products, which could adversely affect our revenues, margins and profitability. Additionally, the expiration of our patents could reduce barriers to entry into additive manufacturing, which could result in the reduction of our sales and earnings potential. If competitors using technology previously protected by our expired patents were to introduce products of inferior quality, our potential customers may view the technology negatively, which would have an adverse effect on our image and reputation and on our ability to compete with systems using other additive fabrication technologies.\nWe intend to continue to follow a strategy of continuing product development to enhance our position to the extent practicable. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current position in the field or continue to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition. If we do not keep pace with technological change and introduce new products, we may lose revenue and demand for our products. We also incur significant costs associated with the investment in our product development in furtherance of our strategy that may not result in increased revenue or demand for our products and which could negatively affect our operating results.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to deliver products that meet changing technology and customer needs.\nOur business may be affected by rapid technological change, changes in user and customer requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new standards and practices, any of which could render our existing products and proprietary technology obsolete. Accordingly, our ongoing research and development programs are intended to enable us to maintain technological leadership. We believe that to remain competitive we must continually enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. However, there is a risk that we may not be able to:\n\u00b7\nDevelop or obtain leading technologies useful in our business;\n\u00b7\nEnhance our existing products;\n\u00b7\nDevelop new products, services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective customers, particularly in the area of printer speeds and print materials functionality;\n\u00b7\nRespond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis; or\n\u00b7\nRecruit or retain key technology employees.\nWe have made, and may make in the future, strategic acquisitions that may involve significant risks and uncertainties. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert management.\nWe completed four acquisitions in 2015. Acquisitions involve certain risks and uncertainties including, among others, the following:\n\u00b7\nDifficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner, which may also impact our ability to realize the potential benefits associated with the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nThe risk that significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration may be encountered;\n\u00b7\nThe challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits;\n\u00b7\nThe risk that our marketplaces do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in the marketplaces that we serve;\n\u00b7\nThe risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying party;\n\u00b7\nThe inability to maintain a relationship with key customers, vendors and other business partners of the acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\nThe difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;\n\u00b7\nThe potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\nThe risk of diverting management attention from our existing operations;\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in coordinating geographically disparate organizations and corporate cultures and integrating management personnel with different business backgrounds;\n\u00b7\nThe potential failure of the due diligence process to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nThe risk that we incur significant costs associated with such acquisition activity that may negatively impact our operating results before the benefits of such acquisitions are realized, if at all;\n\u00b7\nThe risk of incurring significant goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges;\n\u00b7\nThe risk of incurring significant exit costs if products or services are unsuccessful;\n\u00b7\nThe entry into marketplaces where we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger marketplace positions;\n\u00b7\nThe exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with our assuming claims or litigation risks from terminated employees, customers, former shareholders or other third parties; and\n\u00b7\nThe risk that historical financial information may not be representative or indicative of our results as a combined company.\nHistorically, we have experienced growth in our operations, both organically and from acquisitions, and we intend to continue to grow. The adaptation of our infrastructure will require, among other things, continued development of our financial and management controls and management information systems, management of our sales channel, continued capital expenditures, the ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel and the training of new personnel. We cannot be sure that our infrastructure, systems, procedures, business processes and managerial controls will be adequate to support the growth in our operations. Any delays in, or problems associated with, implementing, or transitioning to, new or enhanced systems, procedures, or controls to accommodate and support the requirements of our business and operations and to effectively and efficiently integrate acquired operations may adversely affect our ability to meet customer requirements, manage our product inventory, and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. These potential negative effects could prevent us from realizing the benefits of an acquisition transaction or other growth opportunity. In that event, our competitive position, revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, which could, in turn, adversely affect our share price and shareholder value.\nOur balance sheet contains several categories of intangible assets that we were required to write down in the fourth quarter of 2015 and that we could be required to write off or write down in the future in the event of the impairment of certain of those assets arising from any deterioration in our future performance or other circumstances. Such write-offs or write-downs could adversely impact our earnings and stock price, and our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nAt December 31, 2015, after recording goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, we had $187.9 million in goodwill capitalized on our balance sheet and $157.5 million of other intangible assets, net capitalized on our balance sheet, which represented 38.7% of our total assets.\nAs discussed below, we completed several business acquisitions during 2015, 2014 and 2013. The majority of the acquisitions have resulted in our recording additional goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet. This goodwill typically arose because the purchase price for these businesses reflected a number of factors including the future earnings and cash flow potential of these businesses, the multiples to earnings, cash flow and other factors, such as prices at which similar businesses have been purchased by other acquirers, the competitive nature of the process by which we acquired the business, and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring to existing operations.\nAccounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 350, \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d requires that goodwill and some long-lived intangibles be tested for impairment at least annually. See Notes 2, 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates-Goodwill and other intangible and long-lived assets\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nAs a result of our annual impairment testing, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $443.7 million and other intangible assets impairment charges of $93.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The impairment charges are non-cash in nature and do not impact our cash position or cash flows, but such a charge, and possible additional charges in the future could adversely affect our results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity and could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We will continue to monitor our reporting units in an effort to determine whether events and circumstances warrant further interim impairment testing. We could be required to write off or write down additional amounts in the future in the event of deterioration in our future performance, sustained slower growth or other circumstances.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may incur substantial costs enforcing or acquiring intellectual property rights and defending against third party claims as a result of litigation or other proceedings.\nIn connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights, the acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights or disputes related to the validity or alleged infringement of third party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we have been, and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting attention and energies of management and key technical personnel, and by increasing our costs of doing business. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes.\nThird-party intellectual property claims asserted against us could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from assembling or licensing certain of our products, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the marketplaces in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements. In addition we may incur significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products. Any of these could seriously harm our business.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information, including our digital content, from third-party infringers or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.\nAlthough we defend our intellectual property rights and endeavor to combat unlicensed copying and use of our digital content and intellectual property rights through a variety of techniques, preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is inherently difficult. If our intellectual property becomes subject to piracy attacks, they may harm our business.\nAdditionally, we endeavor to protect the secrecy of our digital content, confidential information and trade secrets. If unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets occurs, we could potentially lose trade secret protection. The loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying previously confidential features, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements. However there is a risk that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations it may be difficult and/or costly for us to enforce our rights.\nOur business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack.\nWe have experienced cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our sensitive information. Prior cyber-attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results; however this may not continue to be the case in the future. Cyber security assessment analyses undertaken by us have identified and prioritized steps to enhance our cyber security safeguards. We are in the process of implementing these recommendations to enhance our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures. Despite the implementation of these new safeguards, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protecting our information or that we will not experience any future successful attacks. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries who target us because of the products and services we provide. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nWe may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our cyber security protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses. These costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations, the services we provide to our customers, our future financial results, our reputation or our stock price; or such events could result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts or other intellectual property or early obsolescence of our products and services.\nIf we cease to generate net cash flow from operations and if we are unable to raise additional capital, our financial condition could be adversely affected and we may not be able to execute our growth strategy.\nWe cannot assure you that we will generate cash from operations or other potential sources to fund future working capital needs and meet capital expenditure requirements.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring or incurring additional debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to obtain additional capital or refinance any indebtedness will depend on, among other things, the capital markets, our financial condition at such time and the terms and conditions of any such financing or indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nFrom time-to-time we may seek access to additional external sources of capital to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. However, we cannot assure you that capital would be available from external sources such as bank credit facilities, debt or equity financings or other potential sources to fund any of those future needs.\nIf our ability to generate cash flow from operations and our existing cash becomes inadequate to meet our needs, our options for addressing such capital constraints include, but are not limited to, (i) obtaining additional debt financing or increasing the limit on our current revolving credit facility, (ii) accessing the public capital markets, or (iii) delaying certain of our existing development projects. If it became necessary to obtain additional debt financing it is likely that such alternatives in the current market environment would be on less favorable terms than we have historically obtained, which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe lack of additional capital resulting from any inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise equity or debt financing could force us to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any necessary funds, if available, would be available on attractive terms or that they would not have a significantly dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. If our financial condition worsens and we become unable to attract additional equity or debt financing or enter into other strategic transactions, we could become insolvent or be forced to declare bankruptcy and we would not be able to execute our growth strategy.\nGlobal economic, political and social conditions and financial markets may harm our ability to do business, adversely affect our sales, costs, results of operations, and cash flow and negatively affect our stock price.\nWe are subject to global economic, political and social conditions that may cause customers to delay or reduce technology purchases due to economic downturns, volatility in fuel and other energy costs, difficulties in the financial services sector and credit markets, geopolitical uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors affecting spending behavior. We face risks that may arise from financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, resellers or customers, including, among others, the following:\n\u00b7\nCustomers or partners to whom we sell our products and services may face financial difficulties or may become insolvent, which could lead to our inability to obtain payment of accounts receivable that those customers may owe;\n\u00b7\nCustomers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products;\n\u00b7\nKey suppliers of raw materials, finished products or components used in the products that we sell may face financial difficulties or may become insolvent, which could lead to disruption in the supply of printers, print materials or spare parts to our customers; and\n\u00b7\nThe inability of customers, including resellers, suppliers and contract manufacturers, to obtain credit financing to finance purchases of our products and raw materials used to build those products.\nThe variety of products that we sell could cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our gross profit margins, and those fluctuations in margins could cause fluctuations in operating income or loss and net income or loss.\nWe continuously work to expand and improve our products, materials and services offerings, the number of geographic areas in which we operate and the distribution channels we use to reach various target product applications and customers. This variety of products, applications and channels involves a range of gross profit margins that can cause substantial quarterly fluctuations in gross profit and gross profit margins depending upon the mix of product shipments from quarter to quarter. Additionally, the introduction of new products or services may further heighten quarterly fluctuations in gross profit and gross profit margins due to manufacturing ramp-up and start-up costs. We may experience significant quarterly fluctuations in gross profit margins or operating income or loss due to the impact of the mix of products, channels or geographic areas in which we sell our products from period to period. In some quarters, it is possible that our financial performance could be below expectations of analysts and investors. If so, the price of our common stock may be volatile or decline and our cost of capital may increase.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from business conducted outside the U.S and are subject to the risks of doing business outside the U.S.\nFor the year ended 2015, 49.0% of our consolidated revenue was derived from customers in countries outside the U.S. There are many risks inherent in business activities outside the U.S. that, unless managed properly, may adversely affect our profitability, including our ability to collect amounts due from customers. While most of our operations outside the U.S. are conducted in highly developed countries, our operations could be adversely affected by, among others, the following:\n\u00b7\nUnexpected changes in laws, regulations and policies of non-U.S. governments relating to investments and operations, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad;\n\u00b7\nChanges in regulatory requirements, including export controls, tariffs and embargoes, other trade restrictions, competition, corporate practices and data privacy concerns;\n\u00b7\nPolitical policies, political or civil unrest, terrorism or epidemics and other similar outbreaks;\n\u00b7\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nLimited protection for the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\nOperating in countries with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices;\n\u00b7\nPotentially adverse changes in taxation; and\n\u00b7\nOther factors, depending upon the specific country in which we conduct business.\nThese uncertainties may make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately plan future business activities and may lead our customers in certain countries to delay purchases of our products and services. More generally, these geopolitical, social and economic conditions could result in increased volatility in global financial markets and economies.\nThe consequences of terrorism or armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our market opportunities or our business. We are uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorism, acts of war and similar events.\nWhile the geographic areas outside the U.S. in which we operate are generally not considered to be highly inflationary, our foreign operations are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates arising from, among other things, certain intercompany transactions that are generally denominated, for example, in U.S. dollars rather than their respective functional currencies.\nMoreover, our operations are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when we consider it to be appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe depend on our supply chain for components and sub-assemblies used in our 3D printers and other products and for raw materials used in our print materials. If these relationships were to terminate or be disrupted, our business could be disrupted while we located alternative suppliers and our expenses may increase.\nWe have outsourced the assembly of certain of our printers to third party suppliers, we purchase components and sub-assemblies for our printers from third-party suppliers, and we purchase raw materials that are used in our print materials, as well as certain of those print materials, from third-party suppliers.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWhile there are several potential suppliers of the components, parts and sub-assemblies for our products, we currently choose to use only one or a limited number of suppliers for several of these components, including our lasers, print materials and certain jetting components. Our reliance on a single or limited number of suppliers involves many risks, including, among others, the following:\n\u00b7\nPotential shortages of some key components;\n\u00b7\nDisruptions in the operations of these suppliers;\n\u00b7\nProduct performance shortfalls; and\n\u00b7\nReduced control over delivery schedules, assembly capabilities, quality and costs.\nWhile we believe that we can obtain all the components necessary for our products from other manufacturers, we require any new supplier to become \u201cqualified\u201d pursuant to our internal procedures, which could involve evaluation processes of varying durations. We generally have our printers and other products assembled based on our internal forecasts and the supply of raw materials, assemblies, components and finished goods from third parties, which are subject to various lead times. In addition, at any time, certain suppliers may decide to discontinue production of an assembly, component or raw material that we use. Any unanticipated change in the sources of our supplies, or unanticipated supply limitations, could increase production or related costs and consequently reduce margins.\nIf our forecasts exceed actual orders, we may hold large inventories of slow-moving or unusable parts, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, profitability and results of operations. Inversely, we may lose orders if our forecast is low and we are unable to meet demand.\nWe have engaged selected design and manufacturing companies to assemble certain of our production printers. In carrying out these outsourcing activities, we face a number of risks, including, among others, the following:\n\u00b7\nThe risk that the parties that we retain to perform assembly activities may not perform in a satisfactory manner;\n\u00b7\nThe risk of disruption in the supply of printers or other products to our customers if such third parties either fail to perform in a satisfactory manner or are unable to supply us with the quantity of printers or other products that are needed to meet then current customer demand; and\n\u00b7\nThe risk of insolvency of these suppliers, as well as the risks that we face, as discussed above, in dealing with a limited number of suppliers.\nThe costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters involving us or our subsidiaries, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations, inquiries or similar matters arising out of our business, including those described in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company cannot predict the outcome of these or any other legal matters. In the future, we may need to record litigation reserves with respect to these matters because our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin, product returns, product liability, warranty or other claims that could result in significant expenses and harm to our reputation.\nWe sell complex hardware and software products, materials and services that can contain undetected design and manufacturing defects or errors when first introduced or as enhancements are released that, despite testing, are not discovered until after the product has been installed and used by customers. Sophisticated software and applications, such as those sold by us, may contain \u201cbugs\u201d that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u2019s intended operation. Defects may also occur in components and products we purchase from third parties. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software, materials and services we sell. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, delayed market acceptance of those products and services, claims from distributors, end-users or others, increased end-user service and support costs, and significant warranty claims and other expenses to correct the defects, diversion of management time and attention and harm to our reputation.\nOur operations could suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key management or other key employees.\nOur success depends upon the continued service and performance of our senior management and other key personnel. Our senior executive team is critical to the management of our business and operations, as well as to the development of our strategy. The loss of the services of one or more members of our senior executive team could delay or prevent the successful implementation of our growth strategy, or our commercialization of new applications for our systems or other products, or could otherwise adversely affect our ability to manage our company effectively and carry out our business plan. Members of our senior management team may resign at any time. High demand exists for senior management and other key personnel (including scientific, technical and sales personnel) in the 3D printing industry, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain such personnel. We experience intense competition for qualified personnel. While we intend to continue to provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain key personnel, some of our competitors for these employees have greater resources and more experience, making it difficult for us to compete successfully for key personnel. If we cannot attract and retain sufficiently qualified technical employees for our research and development and manufacturing operations, we may be unable to achieve the synergies expected from mergers and acquisitions that we may effect from time to time, or to develop and commercialize new products or new applications for existing products. Furthermore, possible shortages of key personnel, including engineers, in the regions surrounding our facilities could require us to pay more to hire and retain key personnel, thereby increasing our costs.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims, which could result in material expense, diversion of management time and attention and damage to our business reputation.\nThe sale and support of our products entails the risk of product liability claims. We may become subject from time to time to product liability claims that could lead to significant expenses. The risk may be heightened when we provide products into certain markets, such as health-care, aerospace and automotive industries.\nThis risk of product liability claims may also be greater due to the use of certain hazardous chemicals used in the production of certain of our products, including irritants, harmful chemicals and chemicals dangerous to the environment. We may also be subject to claims that our printers have been, or may be used to, create parts that are not in compliance with legal requirements or that infringes on the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe attempt to include provisions in our agreements with customers that are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability for damages arising from defects or errors in our products and other issues. However, the nature and extent of these limitations vary from customer to customer. Their effect is subject to a variety of legal limitations and it is possible that these limitations may not be effective as a result of unfavorable judicial decisions or laws enacted in the future.\nAny claim brought against us, regardless of its merit, could result in significant expense, diversion of management time and attention, damage to our business reputation and failure to retain existing customers or to attract new customers. Although we maintain product liability insurance, such insurance is subject to deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. Costs or payments made in connection with product liability claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe rely on our management information systems for inventory management, distribution, and other key functions. If our information systems fail to adequately perform these functions, or if we experience an interruption in their operation, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely on our management information systems to, among other things, effectively manage our accounting and financial functions, including maintaining our internal controls; to manage our manufacturing and supply chain processes; and to maintain our research and development data. The failure of our management information systems to perform properly could disrupt our business and product development, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business and operating results to suffer. Although we take steps to secure our management information systems, including our computer systems, intranet and Internet sites, email and other telecommunications and data networks, the security measures we have implemented may not be effective and our systems may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, natural or man-made disasters, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, power loss, or other disruptive events. Our reputation and financial condition could be adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, our operations are disrupted or shut down; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we must dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs.\nWe are subject to U.S. and other anti-corruption laws, trade controls, economic sanctions, and similar laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative penalties and harm our reputation.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners and investments. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and United Kingdom Bribery Act (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d), export controls and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), the State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (\u201cDDTC\u201d), and the Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d). As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign customers, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations.\nAs part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA\u2019s prohibition on providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. In addition, the provisions of the Bribery Act extend beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also apply to transactions with individuals that a government does not employ. Some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption. Our continued expansion outside the U.S., including in Brazil, China, India and developing countries, and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide, could increase the risk of FCPA, OFAC or Bribery Act violations in the future.\nAs an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws include the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d) administered by the DDTC, the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) administered by the BIS, and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by OFAC. The EAR governs products, parts, technology and software which present military or weapons proliferation concerns, so-called \u201cdual use\u201d items, and ITAR governs military items listed on the United States Munitions List. Prior to shipping certain items, we must obtain an export license or verify that license exemptions are available. Any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products, and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nViolations of anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist our compliance with applicable U.S. and international anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, including the FCPA, the Bribery Act and trade controls and sanctions programs administered by OFAC, the DDTC and BIS, and have trained our employees to comply with these laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, agents or other associated persons will not take actions in violation of our policies and these laws and regulations, and that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage or provide a defense to any alleged violation. In particular, we may be held liable for the actions that our joint venture partners take inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation, even if our policies prohibit it, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business with sanctioned countries, persons and entities, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in, or interpretation of, tax rules and regulations may impact our effective tax rate and future profitability.\nWe are a U.S. based, multinational company subject to taxation in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in statutory tax rates or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in jurisdictions in which we do business, changes in the amount of revenue or earnings in the countries with varying statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, we are subject to audits and examinations of previously filed income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential impact of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that we expect may result from the current examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, there is no assurance that the final determination of any examination will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials, and we must comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur business involves the blending, controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. We and our suppliers are subject to federal, state and local as well as foreign laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by us for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident, state, federal or foreign authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. If we are subject to any liability as a result of activities involving hazardous materials, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected and our reputation may be harmed.\nRegulations related to conflict-free minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and may create challenges with our customers.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability regarding the use of \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo (the \u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries. The SEC has established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use \u201cconflict\u201d minerals sourced from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict-free minerals, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain these conflict-free minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Compliance with these requirements may also increase our costs, including costs that may be incurred in conducting due diligence procedures to determine the sources of certain minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. In addition, we may face challenges with our customers if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals used in our products.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur common stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, considerable volatility. Between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $8.44 per share to a high of $97.28 per share. Numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock, including those described or referred to in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Form 10-K, as well as, among other things:\n\u00b7\nOur perceived value in the securities markets;\n\u00b7\nOverall trends in the stock market;\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements of fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nThe impact of changes in our results of operations, our financial condition or our prospects;\n\u00b7\nFuture sales of our common stock or other securities (including any shares issued in connection with earn-out obligations for any past or future acquisition);\n\u00b7\nMarket conditions for providers of products and services such as ours;\n\u00b7\nExecutive level management uncertainty or change;\n\u00b7\nChanges in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors.\nThe number of shares of common stock issuable in a stock offering, the issuance of restricted stock awards or the issuance of shares in connection with certain acquisitions or the conversion of the notes could dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect the market price for our common stock.\nWe may issue additional securities, from time to time, as necessary to provide flexibility to execute our growth strategy.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes our issuance of up to a total 220.0 million shares of common stock, of which 113.1 million shares have been issued or are otherwise currently reserved for issuance. Future issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing stockholders\u2019 individual ownership percentages and could lead to volatility in our common stock price.\nAdditionally, subject to the limitations of our Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law, we are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions or other issuances of our common stock or convertible securities, including outstanding options, may dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 5 million shares of preferred stock.\nThe Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 5 million shares of preferred stock, none of which is currently issued or outstanding. The Board of Directors is authorized to issue these shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series without further action of the stockholders and in that regard to determine the issue price, rights, preferences and privileges of any such class or series of preferred stock generally without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur ability to issue preferred stock gives us flexibility concerning possible acquisitions and financings, but it could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. In addition, any preferred stock that is issued may have other rights, including dividend rights, liquidation preferences and other economic rights, senior to the common stock, which could have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law contain anti-takeover provisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change in our control.\nCertain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control or the replacement of our incumbent directors and management, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares, possibly at a premium over the then market price of our common stock. One of these Delaware laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder (as defined in the statute) for a period of three years from the date that the person became an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met.", "PERMNO": 78664, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "DDD"}
