RISK FACTORS\nOur business may be impacted as a result of the pandemic impact the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID 19\u201d) may have in the U.S. and global economy.\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and our property portfolio. While we did not incur significant disruptions during 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties. These uncertainties include the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. The pandemic is having a significant impact on the U.S. economy and on the local markets in which our properties are located. Nearly every industry has been impacted directly or indirectly, and the commercial real estate market has come under pressure due to numerous factors, including preventative measures taken by local, state and federal authorities to alleviate the public health crisis such as mandatory business closures, quarantines, and restrictions on travel and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d or \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders. The future impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial activities will depend on future developments, which at this stage are unpredictable considering the fluctuations of COVID-19 outbreaks and the resulting changes in the market.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Business\nAn investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information in this report before trading our securities.\nWe may not be able to access financial markets to obtain capital on a timely basis, or on acceptable terms.\nWe may need to rely on third party capital sources for a portion of our capital needs, including capital for acquisitions and development. The public debt and equity markets are among the sources on which we rely. There is no guarantee that we will be able to access these markets, or any other source of capital. The ability to access the public debt and equity markets depends on a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf general economic conditions affecting these markets;\n\u25cf our own financial structure and performance;\nOur degree of reliance on the operations of certain real estate assets to collect the notes receivable can affect our cash flow.\nThe collection of our notes receivable are dependent upon the ability of the real estate assets that secure the notes to produce sufficient cash flow to service these notes. Changes in general or local economic conditions in the Dallas, Texas area can have an adverse effect on the payment of these notes.\nOur degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe degree of leverage available to the Company could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. The degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt.\nWe may incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which would adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance any existing debt when it matures.\nWe may need to sell assets from time to time for cash flow purposes.\nIn the event that we must sell assets to generate cash flow, we cannot predict whether there will be a market for those assets in the time period we desire or need to sell them, or whether we will be able to sell them at a price that will allow us to fully recoup our investment. We may not be able to realize the full potential value of our assets and we may incur costs related to the early pay-off of the debt secured by such assets. In addition, to the extent that the Company provides financing to the buyer, our ability to collect the amounts owed when due may adversely affect our cash flow.", "PERMNO": 75069, "SIC": 6162, "TIC": "IOR"}
