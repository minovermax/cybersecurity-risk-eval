{"cik": "1494448", "company": "EMERGENT CAPITAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness & Organizational Structure\nAt present, we do not have sufficient funds to pay our debt and other obligations as they come due or to finance our operations for more than a limited period of time.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and operating cash flows may be inadequate to meet our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and our other obligations. At December 31, 2016, 619 of the policies we owned were pledged as collateral under our White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility. When those policies mature, distributions will be made pursuant to a \"waterfall\" payment structure and any amounts available to us will vary based on the respective then current loan to value ratio under the facility. The White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility contemplates that proceeds will be directed to pay fees to service providers and premiums, with any remaining proceeds directed to pay outstanding interest. To the extent there is not sufficient remaining proceeds in the waterfall to satisfy the amount of required interest, White Eagle will be obligated to pay any such shortfall amount.\nUnder the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, proceeds from the maturity of the policies pledged as collateral are distributed pursuant to a waterfall. After distributions for payments of premiums, fees to service providers, and interest, a percentage of the collections from policy proceeds are to be paid to the lenders, which will vary depending on the then loan-to-value ratio (\"LTV\") as illustrated below where the valuation is determined by the lenders:\nProvided that (i) if (a) the Company failed to maintain a cash interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0:1 at any time during the immediately preceding calendar quarter or (b) the Company fails to take steps to improve its solvency in a manner acceptable to the required lenders (as determined in their sole and absolute discretion), then the cash flow sweep percentage to\nthe lenders shall equal one-hundred percent (100%) and (ii) if such distribution date occurs on or after December 29, 2025, then the cash flow sweep percentage shall equal one-hundred percent (100%). See Note 8, \"White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility\" to our accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nAccordingly, there can be no assurance as to when proceeds or the amounts from maturities of the policies pledged as collateral under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility will be distributed to us. In addition, we are not able to borrow money under our White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility to pay interest or principal under the facility or any other indebtedness. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on any of our indebtedness, we will be in default, which could cause defaults under any other of our indebtedness then outstanding. Any such default would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, upon an event of default of the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, absent a waiver, in addition to principal and interest, the lenders\u2019 rights to proceeds from collections under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility will become due. If these obligations cannot be satisfied, the lenders, or their agent, may dispose of, release, or foreclose on (including by means of strict foreclosure on all or any of the policies or on our interests in White Eagle, which might be exercised in a manner intended to impair our rights to excess proceeds of any liquidation of foreclosed assets), or take other actions with respect to the policies pledged as collateral under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility that we or our shareholders may disagree with or that may be contrary to the interests of our shareholders.\nOur substantial leverage and significant debt service obligations adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and make it unlikely for us to fund our operations through the second quarter.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $362.1 million in outstanding long-term debt (without giving effect to the fair value of such indebtedness) consisting of borrowings under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, our 8.50% senior unsecured convertible notes (the \"Convertible Notes\") and the 15% senior secured notes (the \"15% Senior Secured Notes\"). Our substantial level of indebtedness could have important negative consequences to you and us, including:\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty satisfying our debt obligations, including payment of current interest obligations;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty refinancing our existing indebtedness or obtaining financing in the future for working capital, premium payments, portfolio lending, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022\nwe will need to use a substantial portion of our available cash flow to pay interest and principal on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and other business activities;\n\u2022\nour debt level increases our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions;\n\u2022\nour debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general; and\n\u2022\nour leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nWhile the terms of the financing arrangements governing our debt contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Accordingly, we could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future; the more we become leveraged, the more we become exposed to the risks described above.\nWe require additional capital and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital in a timely manner, at the level sought, or on favorable terms or at all.\nSubject to borrowing base limitations and other conditions to funding, White Eagle may borrow proceeds to pay premiums on all of the life insurance policies pledged as collateral under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2016. However, we estimate that, in addition to general overhead expenses, we will need to pay approximately $117,000 in premiums to keep our remaining 2 life insurance policies that have not been pledged as collateral under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility in force through December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $11.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and certificates of deposit of $6.0 million; of this amount, approximately $8.3 million is available to pay premiums on the 2 unencumbered policies and other overhead expenses, with approximately $9.1 million being restricted by the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility. Accordingly, we must proactively manage our cash and may need to raise additional capital in order to effectively run our businesses, maintain the policies that have not been pledged under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, pay interest expense on our debt and opportunistically grow our assets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will, if needed, be able to raise additional or sufficient capital on favorable terms or at all.\nAs part of our cash management and business strategy, we may, subject to the covenants in our debt arrangements, determine to sell all or a portion of our portfolio, but there can be no assurance that we can consummate any sales or that, if consummated, sales of policies will be at or above their carrying values. We may also, subject to the covenants in our debt arrangements and lender approval, determine to lapse certain of these policies that have a low return profile or as our portfolio management needs dictate. The lapsing of policies, if any, could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements and would create losses as the policies would be written down to zero.\nWe may not be successful in consummating a voluntary change to our organizational or finance structure and we may be required to undergo such change involuntarily.\nWe are currently in the process of exploring strategic alternatives that would change our organizational or capital structure, which includes equity recapitalization and debt refinancing. See Note 20 \"Subsequent Events\" of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate such a transaction on a timely basis, or at all. If the process takes longer than anticipated, the Company may seek to raise capital, including, but not limited to a rights offering and the at-the-market offering program. If we are unable to secure additional capital or successfully complete a transaction on a timely basis and on terms that are acceptable to our shareholders, or if our expenses exceed our current plans and expectations, we may be required to participate in a reorganizational transaction that likely will not be favorable to holders of our equity.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner that we own our life settlements and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States, Ireland and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax proceeds from companies. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for intercompany arrangements and ownership of life settlements, which could increase our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal and state authorities and from 2014 on, foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a material negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe U.S., Ireland and many countries in the European Union, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. Certain proposals, including proposals with retroactive effects, could include recommendations that would significantly increase our tax obligations where we do business or where our subsidiaries own life insurance policies. Any changes in the taxation of either international business activities or ownership of life settlements may increase our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations and, under certain circumstances, may constitute an event of default under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe may not be able to refinance the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that may significantly limit our ability to refinance. In addition, the lender under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility has a substantial interest in and priority rights to distributions of certain proceeds from policies pledged by White Eagle. Such covenants and such interests in and rights to distributions may significantly reduce our ability to attract replacement financing were we to seek to refinance the credit facility as a means of limiting adverse actions by the lenders in the exercise of their remedies in relation to any event of default.\nWe may be unable to deduct interest payments on debt that is attributed to policies that we own, which would reduce any future income and cash flows.\nGenerally, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), interest paid or accrued on debt obligations is deductible in computing a taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax liability. However, when the proceeds of indebtedness\nare used to pay premiums on life insurance policies that are owned by the entity incurring the debt or otherwise used to support the purchase or ownership of life insurance policies, the interest in respect of such proceeds may not be deductible. Accordingly, so long as we use a portion of debt financing to pay the premiums on policies owned by us or to support the continued ownership of life insurance policies by us, the interest paid or accrued on that portion of the debt may not be currently deductible by us for federal income tax purposes. We have net operating losses that we may be able to use to reduce a portion of our future taxable income, but the inability to currently deduct interest accrued on debt could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings and cash flows available for the payment of interest.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an \"ownership change\" (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period) is subject to limitation on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards, or net operating losses, to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change, as may future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the purchase price. If an ownership change has occurred or does occur in the future, our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset income if we attain profitability may be limited.\nWe may adopt a tax benefit preservation plan in the form of a Section 382 Rights Agreement, designed to preserve the value of certain income tax assets, primarily net operating loss carryforwards, which may discourage acquisition and sale of large blocks of our stock and may result in significant dilution for certain stockholders, may deter institutional investors from investing in our stock, and may deter potential acquirers from making premium offers to acquire the Company, factors which may depress the market price of our stock.\nWe may not have the cash necessary to repurchase the Convertible Notes and the 15% Senior Secured Notes as well as may not have the funds available to pay required interest.\nWe have issued $70.7 million in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes and $30.0 million in 15% Senior Secured Notes. Holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A fundamental change under the Convertible Notes is deemed to occur whenever any of the following occurs: (a) our common stock ceases to be listed or quoted on a national securities exchange in the United States, (b) our shareholders approve any plans for liquidation or dissolution, or (c) we experience a change in control represented by: (i) a majority of the members of our board of directors no longer being considered continuing directors, (ii) a transaction whereby our shareholders own less than 50% of the surviving company after the transaction, or (iii) a person or group obtaining more than 50% of the voting power of the common stock.\nHowever, we may not have enough available cash to make a required repurchase of the Convertible Notes at the applicable time, and may not be able to obtain the necessary financing on favorable terms. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes may be limited by law or by the agreements governing our other indebtedness that exist at the time of the repurchase, as the case may be. Our failure to repurchase the Convertible Notes when required by their indenture would constitute a default, which could also lead to a default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and to repurchase the Convertible Notes. Any such default would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nInterest on the Convertible Notes and on the 15% Senior Secured Notes is due semi-annually and quarterly, respectively. On February 14, 2017, the Company entered into a solicitation to consent (the \"Consent Solicitation\") to issue additional Convertible Notes (the \"Additional Convertible Notes\") in lieu of a cash payment of interest due on February 15, 2017 (the \"2017 Interest Payment Date\") to holders of the Convertible Notes. The Company's obligation to issue the Additional Convertible Notes was subject to the satisfaction of (1) not less than 95% of the aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes agreeing to accept Additional Convertible Notes in lieu of a cash payment of interest on the 2017 Interest Payment Date and (2) the amendment of the Indenture dated as of March 11, 2016 with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as indenture trustee for the 15% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the \"Senior Secured Indenture\") to permit the issuance of the Additional Convertible Notes. This consent is only effective for the cash payment of interest due on February 15, 2017 and not for subsequent interest payments.\nOn March 14, 2017, the Company issued an additional $3.5 million in Additional Convertible Notes following the Company\u2019s receipt of requisite consents of the holders of the Convertible Notes of approximately 98% of the aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes (the \"Consenting Holders\"), pursuant to the Consent Solicitation, whereby each Consenting Holder agreed to accept Additional Convertible Notes in lieu of a cash payment of interest on the Convertible Notes due on the 2017 Interest Payment Date. All Additional Convertible Notes issued by the Company to Consenting Holders were issued under the Indenture dated February 21, 2014 between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (the\n\"Convertible Indenture\") and such Additional Convertible Notes have identical terms to existing Convertible Notes. Interest on the Additional Convertible Notes will accrue from February 15, 2017.\nThe Company did not make an interest payment of $1.1 million, due March 15, 2017, on the 15.0% Senior Secured Notes, of which $30.0 million principal amount was outstanding on that date. If the interest payment is not made within five business days of its due date, such failure would result in an event of default under the Senior Secured Indenture governing the 15.0% Senior Secured Notes, and the trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding 15.0% Senior Secured Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest immediately due and payable. Any such default would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. The Company released the cash interest payment of $1.1 million to the holders of the 15% Senior Secured Notes on March 20, 2017.\nOn March 15, 2017 the Company entered into a series of separate agreements (the \"Agreements\") with a third party and certain holders of the convertible notes regarding a series of integrated transactions with the intent to effect a recapitalization of the Company (the \"Transaction\"). The agreements include, among other transactions, a Convertible Note Exchange Offer, New Convertible Notes, a Senior Note Exchange Offer, and New Senior Notes (each as defined in the Agreements and, together with the Agreements and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreements, the \"Transaction Documents\").\nAs part of the Transaction, the Company will offer to exchange, in each case with existing holders, its outstanding Convertible Notes for 5.0% Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2023 (the \"New Convertible Notes\"), and its outstanding 15.0% Senior Secured Notes for 8.5% Senior Notes due 2021 (the \"New Senior Notes\"). At least 98% of the holders of each class of notes must tender in the relevant exchange offer as a condition to closing the Transaction.\nThe Transaction is subject to certain conditions, including that the Company shall have obtained the requisite approval by the Company's shareholders to amend the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company' common stock, $0.01 par value (the \"Common Stock\"), and that the requisite number of holders of the Company's 15% Senior Secured Notes and Convertible Notes shall have tendered their notes in connection with the applicable exchange offer as described herein, and certain customary closing conditions, including that each of the Transaction Documents shall have been executed and delivered to the other parties thereto. The Transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017, although the consummation of the Transaction is subject to multiple conditions and there can be no assurance that the Transaction will close on a timely basis or at all. Failure to close the Transaction would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may fail to comply with certain other financial covenants, which could lead to default and the need to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws.\nWe currently anticipate that we will not comply with our financial covenant under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility to maintain a cash interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0:1. Absent waivers or cures, non-compliance with such covenant would result in the cash flow sweep percentage being equal to one-hundred percent (100%), and even if the required LTV ratio may have been satisfied, the Company would not participate in any cash flow sweep. As of December 31, 2016, the cash interest coverage ratio was 1.65:1 and the LTV ratio was 55%, which was calculated using the lender's valuation. It is possible we could obtain waivers from our debt holder; however, the aforementioned projections and certain liquidity risks raise substantial doubt about whether we will meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date of issuance of this report.\nThere can be no assurance that management's plan to improve our operating performance and financial position will be successful or that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. As a result, our liquidity and ability to timely pay our obligations when due could be severely limited. Furthermore, our debt holders and creditors may resist renegotiation or lengthening of payment and other terms through legal action or otherwise. If we are not able to timely, successfully or efficiently implement the strategies that we are pursuing to improve our operating performance and financial position, obtain alternative sources of capital or otherwise meet our liquidity needs, we may need to voluntarily seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have been experiencing net losses and expect that net losses could continue for an uncertain period. If we continue to operate at a loss, our business will not be financially viable.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our net loss from continuing operations was $49.4 million. We have now reported 3 consecutive loss years with an accumulated deficit of $132.5 million. As of December 31, 2016, our cash balance was $11.3\nmillion and certificates of deposit were $6.0 million. We had net working capital of $16.4 million, outstanding debt of $362.1 million and we had life settlement assets of $498.4 million. If we do not succeed in our business plan\u2019s objectives to achieve profitability, our business might continue to experience losses and may not be sustainable in the future.\nAt our current estimated burn rate, we only have sufficient capital to continue through the second quarter. Accordingly, we must raise capital to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance that we can raise additional funding to continue as a going concern or to operate profitably. Any inability to obtain additional financing when needed could require us to significantly curtail or cease operations. Even if funding is available to us, we cannot assure investors that additional financing will be available on terms that are favorable to us or to our existing shareholders. If we fail to raise sufficient funds, investors may lose their entire investment.\nOur success in operating our life finance business is dependent on making accurate assumptions about life expectancies and maintaining adequate cash balances to pay premiums.\nWe are responsible for paying all premiums necessary to keep the policies in our portfolio in force and prevent them from lapsing. We estimate that we will need to pay $117,000 in premiums to keep our current portfolio of life insurance policies that are not pledged as collateral under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility in force through 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $11.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and certificates of deposit of $6.0 million; of this amount, approximately $8.3 million is available to pay premiums on the 2 unencumbered policies and general expenses, with approximately $9.1 million being restricted by the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility. By using cash reserves to pay premiums for retained life insurance policies, we will have less cash available for other business purposes. Therefore, our cash flows and the required amount of our cash reserves to pay premiums is dependent on our assumptions about life expectancies being accurate.\nLife expectancies are estimates of the expected longevity or mortality of an insured and are inherently uncertain. A life expectancy obtained on an insured for a life insurance policy may not be predictive of the future longevity or mortality of the insured. Inaccurate forecasting of an insured\u2019s life expectancy could result from, among other things: (i) advances in medical treatment (e.g., new cancer treatments) resulting in deaths occurring later than forecasted; (ii) inaccurate diagnosis or prognosis; (iii) changes to life style habits or the individual\u2019s ability to fight disease, resulting in improved health; (iv) reliance on outdated or incomplete age or health information about the insured, or on information that is inaccurate (whether or not due to fraud or misrepresentation by the insured); or (v) improper or flawed methodology or assumptions in terms of modeling or crediting of medical conditions.\nIn forecasting estimated life expectancies, we utilize third party medical underwriters to evaluate the medical condition and life expectancy of each insured. The firms that provide health assessments and life expectancy information may depend on, among other things, actuarial tables and model inputs for insureds and third-party information from independent physicians who, in turn, may not have personally performed a physical examination of any of the insureds and may have relied solely on reports provided to them by attending physicians or other health care providers with whom they were authorized to communicate. The accuracy of this information has not been and will not be independently verified by us or our service providers.\nIf life expectancy valuations underestimate the longevity of the insureds, the actual maturity date of the life insurance policies may be farther in the future than projected. Consequently, we may not have sufficient cash for payment of insurance premiums or to service our indebtedness. The extension of time to receive a return on our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring 2015, the U.S. Society of Actuaries (the \"SOA\") released new versions of the Valuation Basic Tables, the (\"2015 VBT\"). The 2015 VBT has a significant increase in exposure and number of claims compared to the 2008 VBT is believed to be a better fit for the life settlement industry, and is becoming more widely accepted. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company changed its valuation technique and decided to adopt the 2015 VBT, smoker and gender distinct tables, to determine the value of the policies. The table shows lower mortality rates in the earlier select periods at most ages, so while the Company continues to fit the life expectancies from independent life expectancy providers (each, an \"LE provider\") to the 2015 VBT, the change in the mortality curve changes the timing of the Company\u2019s expected cash flow streams. Adopting the 2015 VBT resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our policies, and had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent and future increases to the premiums due on life insurance policies that we own will adversely affect the fair value and our returns on such life insurance policies.\nTo keep the life insurance policies that we own in force, insurance premiums must be timely paid. Projected premium payments are a critical component of our fair value estimates, and any increase in expected premiums will likely decrease the fair value of a given life insurance policy and adversely affect the return on that policy. Commencing in the third quarter of 2015, 24 of our policies became subject to a cost of insurance increase. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the cost of insurance increase for these additional policies caused the fair value of our life settlements to decrease by approximately $3.2 million and approximately $7.6 million since the third quarter of 2015. Further cost of insurance increases may cause our projected premium payments to significantly increase, adversely affect the loan to value ratios under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility and otherwise could have an adverse, material effect on our business, results of operations and the value of any affected policies.\nThe premiums necessary to maintain our life finance assets are expected to increase if we were to acquire additional policies.\nThe premiums necessary to keep our policies in force may increase. Assuming no maturities in 2017, we would need to pay $118,000 in premiums in 2017 to maintain the policies owned as of December 31, 2016 that are not pledged under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility. For the 619 policies pledged as collateral under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, White Eagle is eligible to borrow under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility to pay the estimated $86.1 million in premiums for 2017 (assuming no maturities), so long as the applicable borrower maintains compliance with the borrowing base formula determined by the lender. If White Eagle is unable to draw under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, it may not be able to sustain the policies it owns, which could lead to lapses or an event of default under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" under Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nContractions in the market for life insurance policies could make it more difficult for us to opportunistically sell policies that we own and may make it more difficult to borrow under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility.\nA potential sale of a life insurance policy owned by us depends significantly on the market for life insurance, which may contract or disappear depending on the impact of potential government regulation, future economic conditions and/or other market variables. For example, the secondary and tertiary markets for life insurance policies incurred a significant slowdown in 2008, which lasted several years. Historically, many investors who invest in life insurance policies are foreign investors who are attracted by potential investment returns from life insurance policies issued by United States life insurers with high ratings and financial strength, as well as by the view that such investments are non-correlated assets-meaning changes in the equity or debt markets should not affect returns on such investments. Changes in the value of the United States dollar and corresponding exchange rates, as well as changes to the ratings of United States life insurers can cause foreign investors to suffer a reduction in the value of their United States dollar denominated investments and reduce their demand for such products, which could make it more difficult for us to opportunistically sell our life insurance policies.\nThe ability of White Eagle to continue to draw borrowings under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility is controlled by a borrowing base formula. To the extent the above noted and other factors result in market contractions, they will likely also negatively impact the value of the policies owned by White Eagle, which could decrease the borrowing base under the facility. If White Eagle is unable to draw under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, it may not be able to sustain the policies it owns, which could lead to lapses or an event of default under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur fair value assumptions are inherently subjective and, if the fair value of our life insurance policies decreases, we will report losses with respect to these policies.\nWhen we obtain ownership of a life insurance policy, we record the policy as an investment in life settlements at the transaction price as of the date of acquisition. At the end of each reporting period, we re-value the life insurance policies we own. To the extent that the calculation results in an adjustment to the fair value of the policy, we record this as a change in fair value of our life insurance policies. This evaluation of the fair value of life insurance policies is inherently subjective as it requires estimates and assumptions that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Using our valuation model, we determine the fair value of life insurance policies on a discounted cash flow basis. The most significant assumptions that we estimate are the life expectancy of the insured, expected premium payments and the discount rate. The discount rate is based upon current information about market interest rates, the credit exposure to the insurance company that issued the life insurance policy and our estimate of the risk margin an investor in the policy would require. Third party life expectancy providers review and analyze the medical records of an insured and provide us with a life expectancy estimate based on the insured\u2019s health. We then calculate a mortality impairment factor for the insured as that factor which, when applied to our mortality table, reproduces the same life expectancy provided for that insured. We use the resulting mortality impairment factor to generate a series of probabilistic future cash flows for the policy, which we then discount and aggregate to\narrive at the fair value of the policy. If we are unable to accurately estimate any of these factors, we may have to write down the fair value of our life settlements, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition. Adopting the 2015 VBT resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our policies. See, \"Our success in operating our life finance business is dependent on making accurate assumptions about life expectancies and maintaining adequate cash balances to pay premiums,\" under Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\nInsurable interest concerns regarding a life insurance policy can also adversely impact its fair value. A claim or the perceived potential for a claim for rescission or a challenge to insurable interest by an insurance company or by persons with an insurable interest in the insured of a portion of or all of the policy death benefit can negatively impact the fair value of a life insurance policy.\nIf the calculation of fair value results in a decrease in value, we record this reduction as a loss. If we determine that it is appropriate to increase the discount rate or adjust other inputs to our fair value model, if we are otherwise unable to accurately estimate the assumptions in our valuation model, or if other factors cause the fair value of our life insurance policies to decrease, the carrying value of our assets may be materially adversely affected and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe life insurance policies that we own may be subject to contest, rescission and/or non-cooperation by the issuing life insurance company, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAll states require that the initial purchaser of a new life insurance policy insuring the life of an individual have an \u201cinsurable interest,\u201d meaning a stake in the insured\u2019s health and wellbeing, rather than the insured\u2019s death, in such individual\u2019s life at the time of original issuance of the policy. Whether an insurable interest exists in the context of the purchase of a life insurance policy is critical because, in the absence of a valid insurable interest, life insurance policies are unenforceable under most states\u2019 laws. Where a life insurance policy has been issued to a policyholder without an insurable interest in the life of the individual who is insured, the life insurance company may be able to void or rescind the policy. Even if the insurance company cannot void or rescind the policy, the insurable interest laws of a number of states provide that persons with an insurable interest on the life of the insured may have the right to recover a portion or all of the death benefit payable under a policy from a person who has no insurable interest on the life of the insured. These claims can generally only be brought if the policy was originally issued to a person without an insurable interest in the life of the insured.\nMany states have enacted statutes prohibiting stranger-originated life insurance, or STOLI, in which an individual purchases a life insurance policy with the intention of selling it to a third-party investor, who lacks an insurable interest in the insured\u2019s life. Some insurance carriers have contested policies as STOLI arrangements, specifically citing the existence of certain nonrecourse premium financing arrangements as a basis to challenge the validity of the policies used to collateralize the financing. Additionally, if an insurance carrier alleges that there were misrepresentations or fraud in the application process for an insurance policy, they may sue us or others to contest or rescind that policy. Decisions in Florida have increased the risk that challenges to premium financed policies may be decided in favor of the issuing insurance company. Moreover, because life insurance policies we own were originated in the same or a similar manner and in a limited number of states, there is a heightened risk that an adverse court decision or other challenge or determination by a regulatory or other interested party with respect to a policy could have a material adverse effect on a significant number of other policies. If a policy that we own is subject to a successful contest or rescission, the fair value of the policy could be reduced to zero, negatively impacting the discount rates used to value our portfolio generally and our ability to sell policies. Generally, life insurance policies may only be rescinded by the issuing life insurance company within the contestability period, which, in most states is two years. Lack of insurable interest can in some instances form the basis of loss of right to payment under a life insurance policy for many years beyond the contestability period and insurance carriers have been known to challenge claims for death benefits for more than five years from issuance of the policy.\nFrom time to time, insurance carriers have challenged the validity of policies owned by us or that once served as the underlying collateral for a premium finance loan made by us. See \"Litigation\" under Note 15, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the USAO Investigation and the SEC Investigation have caused us to experience more challenges to policies by insurers attempting to use such investigations and the Non-Prosecution Agreement as grounds for rescinding or contesting a policy. Any such future challenges may result in a cloud over title and collectability, increased costs, delays in payment of life insurance proceeds or even the voiding of a policy, and could have a material adverse effect on the ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, if an insurance company successfully rescinds or contests a policy, the insurance company may not be required to refund all or, in some cases, any of the insurance premiums paid for the policy. While defending an action to contest or rescind a policy, premium payments may have to continue to be made to the life insurance company. Hence, in the case of a contest or rescission, premiums paid to the carrier (including those paid during the pendency of a contest or rescission action) may not be refunded. If they are not, we may suffer a complete loss with respect to a policy, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPremium financed life insurance policies are susceptible to a higher risk of fraud and misrepresentation on life insurance applications, which increases the risk of contest, rescission or non-cooperation by issuing life insurance carriers.\nWhile fraud and misrepresentation by applicants and potential insureds in completing life insurance applications exist generally in the life insurance industry (especially with respect to the health and medical history and condition of the potential insured as well as the applicant\u2019s net worth), such risk of fraud and misrepresentation may be heightened in connection with life insurance policies for which the premiums are financed through premium finance loans. In particular, there is a risk that applicants and potential insureds may not have truthfully or completely answered questions related to whether the life insurance policy premiums would be financed through a premium finance loan or otherwise, the applicants\u2019 purpose for purchasing the policy or the applicants\u2019 intention regarding the future sale or transfer of life insurance policies. Such risk may be further increased to the extent life insurance agents communicated to applicants and potential insureds regarding potential premium finance arrangements or transfers of life insurance policies through payment defaults under premium finance loans. In the ordinary course of our legacy premium finance business, our sales team received inquiries from life insurance agents and brokers regarding the availability of premium finance loans for their clients. However, any communication between the life insurance agent and the potential policyholder or insured is beyond our control and we may not know whether a life insurance agent discussed with the potential policyholder or the insured the possibility of a premium finance loan by us or the subsequent transfer of the life insurance policy. Consequently, notwithstanding the representations and certifications obtained from the policyholders, insureds and the life insurance agents, there is a risk that insurance carriers, the estates or heirs of insureds, or others could contest policies we acquired through foreclosures of premium finance loans based on fraud or misrepresentation as to any information provided to the life insurance company, including the life insurance application. See \"Litigation\" under Note 15, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nMisrepresentations, fraud, omissions or lack of insurable interest can also, in some instances, form the basis of loss of right to payment under a life insurance policy. Based on statements made in the Non-Prosecution Agreement, there is a risk that policies that we own may increasingly be challenged by insurance carriers and the estates or heirs of insureds. Any such challenges to the policies may result in increased costs, delays in payment of life insurance proceeds or even the voiding of a policy, a reduction in the fair value of a policy and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, of the 621 policies in our life settlement portfolio, 539 policies were previously premium financed.\nDelays in payment and non-payment of life insurance policy proceeds can occur for many reasons and any such delays may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA number of arguments may be made by former beneficiaries (including but not limited to spouses, ex-spouses and descendants of the insured) under a life insurance policy, by the beneficiaries of the trust that once held the policy, by the estate or legal heirs of the insured or by the insurance company issuing such policy, to deny or delay payment of proceeds following the death of an insured, including arguments related to lack of mental capacity of the insured, usury, contestability or suicide provisions in a policy. The statements in the Non-Prosecution Agreement may make such delays more likely and may increase challenges by carriers to paying out death claims or challenges by families of insureds to policy proceeds. Furthermore, if the death of an insured cannot be verified and no death certificate can be produced, the related insurance company may not pay the proceeds of the life insurance policy until the passage of a statutory period (usually five to seven years) for the presumption of death without proof. Such delays in payment or non-payment of policy proceeds may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete with a number of other finance companies and investors and may encounter additional competition.\nThere are a number of finance companies and investors that compete with us in the life finance industry. Many are significantly larger and possess considerably greater financial, marketing, management and other resources than we do. The life finance business could also prove attractive to new entrants. As a consequence, competition in this sector may increase. Increased competition could result in increased acquisition costs, changes to discount rates, margin compression and/or less\nfavorable financing terms, each of which could materially adversely affect our income, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf a regulator or court decides that trusts that were formed to own the life insurance policies that once served as collateral for our premium finance loans do not have an insurable interest in the life of the insured, such determination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGenerally, there are two forms of insurable interests in the life of an individual, familial and financial. Additionally, an individual is deemed to have an insurable interest in his or her own life. It is also a common practice for an individual, as a grantor or settlor, to form an irrevocable trust to purchase and own a life insurance policy insuring the life of the grantor or settlor, where the beneficiaries of the trust are persons who themselves, by virtue of certain familial relationships with the grantor or settlor, also have an insurable interest in the life of the insured. In the event of a payment default on our premium finance loan, we generally acquired life insurance policies owned by trusts (or the beneficial interests in the trust itself) that we believe had an insurable interest in the life of the related insureds. However, a state insurance regulatory authority or a court may determine that the trust or policy owner did not have an insurable interest in the life of the insured or that we, as lender, only have a limited insurable interest. Any such determination could result in our being unable to receive the proceeds of the life insurance policy, which could lead to a total loss on our investment in life settlements. Any such loss or losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the creditworthiness of the life insurance companies that issued the policies in comprising our portfolio. If a life insurance company defaults on its obligation to pay death benefits on a policy we own, we would experience a loss of our investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the creditworthiness of the life insurance companies that issued the policies that we own. We assume the credit risk associated with life insurance policies issued by various life insurance companies. The failure or bankruptcy of any such life insurance or annuity company could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation. A life insurance company\u2019s business tends to track general economic and market conditions that are beyond its control, including extended economic recessions or interest rate changes. Changes in investor perceptions regarding the strength of insurers generally and the policies or annuities they offer can adversely affect our ability to sell or finance our assets. Adverse economic factors and volatility in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on a life insurance company\u2019s business and credit rating, financial condition and operating results, and an issuing life insurance company may default on its obligation to pay death benefits on the life insurance policies that we own. In such event, we would experience a loss of our investment in such life insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nWe are subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires us to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. We have consumed and will continue to consume management resources and incur expenses for SOX compliance on an ongoing basis. In addition, as we have reduced the number of our employees and moved certain of our operations to foreign subsidiaries, we have increased our reliance on third parties for various aspects of our internal controls. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nChanges to statutory, licensing and regulatory regimes governing life settlements could have a material adverse effect on our activities and income.\nChanges to statutory, licensing and regulatory regimes could result in the enforcement of stricter compliance measures or adoption of additional measures on us or on the insurance companies that stand behind the insurance policies that we own, which could have a material adverse impact on our business activities and income. The SEC issued a task force report in July 2010 recommending that sales of life insurance policies in life settlement transactions be regulated as securities for purposes of the federal securities laws. To date, the SEC has not made such a recommendation to Congress. However, if the statutory definitions of \"security\" were amended to encompass life settlements, we could become subject to additional extensive\nregulatory requirements under the federal securities laws, including the obligation to register sales and offerings of life settlements with the SEC as public offerings under the Securities Act of 1933 and, potentially, the obligation to register as an \"investment company\" pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940. Any legislation implementing such regulatory change or a change in the transactions that are characterized as life settlement transactions could lead to significantly increased compliance costs, increased liability risk and adversely affect our ability to acquire or sell life insurance policies in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the new Presidential administration and U.S. Congress, we expect that there may be many changes to existing U.S. laws, regulations, and standards. Because of the uncertainty regarding existing law, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of such change on our business model, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing, or effect of changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential legislation.\nOur former structured settlements business may expose us to future claims or contingent liabilities.\nPursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement we entered into in connection with the sale of our structured settlements business, we sold substantially all of that business\u2019 operating assets while retaining substantially all of its liabilities. In addition, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain breaches of representations and warranties regarding us and various aspects of that business. Many of our indemnification obligations are subject to time and maximum liability limitations, however, in some instances our indemnification obligations are not subject to any limitations. Significant indemnification claims by the purchaser or other claims or contingent liability related to our former structured settlement business could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain the security of personally identifiable and other information, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such information, or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such information, could adversely affect us.\nIn connection with our business, we collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to insureds and counterparties. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security and privacy is constantly evolving. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of customer, counterparty, employee or our data by cybercrime or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines, penalties, litigation or regulatory action.\nDisasters, disruptions and other impairment of our information technologies and systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur businesses depend upon the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems, including third party hosted services and data facilities that we do not control. While we have developed certain disaster recovery plans and backup systems, these plans and systems are not fully redundant. A system disruption caused by a natural disaster, cybercrime or other impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and may cause delays, loss of critical data and reputational harm, and could otherwise prevent us from servicing our portfolio of life insurance policies.\nThe loss of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our key executive officers, including Antony Mitchell, our chief executive officer. Mr. Mitchell has significant experience operating specialty finance businesses, which are highly regulated. If we should lose Mr. Mitchell, such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we do not maintain key man life insurance with respect to any of our executives other than Mr. Mitchell.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our executive officers\u2019 employment agreements could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors or otherwise effect a change of control, which could diminish the price of our common stock.\nWe have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers. These agreements provide for substantial payments upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, including a material diminution of base salaries or\nresponsibilities. These payments may deter any transaction that would result in a change in control, which could diminish the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors or otherwise effect a change of control, which could diminish the price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so. In particular, shareholders are required to provide us with advance notice of shareholder nominations and proposals to be brought before any annual meeting of shareholders, which could discourage or deter a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or to introduce a proposal. In addition, our articles of incorporation eliminate our shareholders\u2019 ability to act without a meeting and require the holders of not less than 50% of the voting power of our common stock to call a special meeting of shareholders.\nThese provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable. For example, these provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging changes in management and takeover attempts in the future. Furthermore, our articles of incorporation and our bylaws provide that the number of directors shall be fixed from time to time by our board of directors, provided that the board shall consist of at least three and no more than fifteen members.\nThe market price of our stock has been highly volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated and could fluctuate substantially in the future. This volatility may subject our stock price to material fluctuations due to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section, and other factors including market reaction to the estimated fair value of our portfolio; our capital structure; cash position; ability to service our debt; rumors or dissemination of false information; changes in coverage or earnings estimates by analysts; our ability to meet analysts\u2019 or market expectations; and sales of common stock by existing shareholders.\nThe conversion rate for the Convertible Notes will be adjusted in connection with a make-whole fundamental change.\nIf a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior to maturity, under certain circumstances, we will increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock for the Convertible Notes converted in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. The increase in the conversion rate will be determined based on the date on which the make-whole fundamental change occurs or becomes effective and the price paid (or deemed paid) per share of common stock in such fundamental change. A make-whole fundamental change generally means a fundamental change or redemption by us of the Convertible Notes. Such increase in the conversion rate will dilute the ownership interest of our common stock shareholders.\nCertain laws of the State of Florida could impede a change of control, which could diminish the price of our common stock.\nAs a Florida corporation, we are subject to the Florida Business Corporation Act, which provides that a person who acquires shares in an \"issuing public corporation,\" as defined in the statute, in excess of certain specified thresholds generally will not have any voting rights with respect to such shares, unless such voting rights are approved by the holders of a majority of the votes of each class of securities entitled to vote separately, excluding shares held or controlled by the acquiring person. The Florida Business Corporation Act also contains a statute which provides that an affiliated transaction with an interested shareholder generally must be approved by (i) the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of our voting shares, other than the shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder, or (ii) a majority of the disinterested directors.\nOne of our subsidiaries, Imperial Life Settlements, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is licensed as a viatical settlement provider and is regulated by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. As a Florida viatical settlement provider, Imperial Life Settlements, LLC is subject to regulation as a specialty insurer under certain provisions of the Florida Insurance Code. Under applicable Florida law, no person can finally acquire, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of a viatical settlement provider or its controlling company without the written approval of the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Accordingly, any person who acquires beneficial ownership of 10% or more of our voting securities will be required by law to notify the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation no later than five days after any form of tender offer or exchange offer is proposed, or no later than five days after the acquisition of securities or ownership interest if no tender offer\nor exchange offer is involved. Such person will also be required to file with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation an application for approval of the acquisition no later than 30 days after the same date that triggers the 5-day notice requirement.\nThe Florida Office of Insurance Regulation may disapprove the acquisition of 10% or more of our voting securities by any person who refuses to apply for and obtain regulatory approval of such acquisition. In addition, if the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation determines that any person has acquired 10% or more of our voting securities without obtaining its regulatory approval, it may order that person to cease the acquisition and divest itself of any shares of our voting securities that may have been acquired in violation of the applicable Florida law. Due to the requirement to file an application with and obtain approval from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, purchasers of 10% or more of our voting securities may incur additional expenses in connection with preparing, filing and obtaining approval of the application, and the effectiveness of the acquisition will be delayed pending receipt of approval from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.\nThe Florida Office of Insurance Regulation may also take disciplinary action against Imperial Life Settlements, LLC\u2019s license if it finds that an acquisition of our voting securities is made in violation of the applicable Florida law and would render the further transaction of business hazardous to our counterparties, creditors, shareholders or the public.\nDue to delisting our common stock from the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"), you may find it difficult to dispose of your shares and our share price may be adversely affected.\nOn January 23, 2017, we voluntarily delisted our common stock from the NYSE, and on February 3, 2017, the trading of our common stock became listed on the over-the-counter market, OTCQB. Such trading could reduce the market liquidity of our common stock. As a result, investors may find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common stock, and our ability to raise future capital through the sale of the shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock could be severely limited.\nTrading in our common stock might also become subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trade involving a stock defined as a \"penny stock\" (generally, any equity security not listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on The NASDAQ Stock Market that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions). Many brokerage firms are reluctant to recommend low-priced stocks to their clients. Moreover, various regulations and policies restrict the ability of stockholders to borrow against or \"margin\" low-priced stocks, and declines in the stock price below certain levels may trigger unexpected margin calls. Additionally, because brokers\u2019 commissions on low-priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher priced stocks, the current price of the common stock can result in an individual stockholder paying transaction costs that represent a higher percentage of total share value than would be the case if our share price were higher. This factor may also limit the willingness of institutions to purchase our common stock. Finally, the additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from facilitating trades in our common stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of the stock and the ability of investors to trade our common stock, thereby negatively impacting the share price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12557, "SIC": 6159, "TIC": "EMGC"}
