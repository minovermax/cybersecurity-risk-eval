{"cik": "1120370", "company": "BROADWIND ENERGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur financial and operating performance is subject to certain factors out of our control, including the state of the wind energy market in North America.\nAs a supplier of products to wind turbine manufacturers, our results of operations (like those of our customers) are subject to general economic conditions, and specifically to the state of the wind energy market. In addition to the state and federal government policies supporting renewable energy described above, the growth and development of the larger wind energy market in North America is subject to a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u00b7\nthe availability and cost of financing for the estimated pipeline of wind energy development projects;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of electricity, which may be affected by a number of factors, including government regulation, power transmission, seasonality, fluctuations in demand, and the cost and availability of fuel and particularly natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe general demand for electricity or \u201cload growth\u201d;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of competing power sources, including natural gas, nuclear power, solar power and other power sources;\n\u00b7\nthe development of new power generating technology or advances in existing technology or discovery of power generating natural resources;\n\u00b7\nthe development of electrical transmission infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nstate and federal laws and regulations regarding avian protection plans and noise or turbine setback requirements;\n\u00b7\nstate and federal laws and regulations, particularly those favoring low carbon energy generation alternatives;\n\u00b7\nadministrative and legal challenges to proposed wind energy development projects;\n\u00b7\nthe improvement in efficiency and cost of wind energy, as influenced by advances in turbine design and operating efficiencies; and\n\u00b7\npublic perception and localized community responses to wind energy projects.\nIn addition, while some of the factors listed above may only affect individual wind energy project developments or portions of the market, in the aggregate they may have a significant effect on the successful development of the wind energy market as a whole, and thus affect our operating and financial results.\nWe may have difficulty maintaining our current financing arrangements or obtaining additional financing when needed or on acceptable terms, and there can be no assurance that our operations will generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness.\nWe rely on banks and capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations or asset sales. We have experienced operating losses for most periods during which we have operated, and our committed sources of liquidity may be inadequate to satisfy our operational needs. There can be no assurances that even if we were to achieve in part any or all of our strategic objectives that we would be successful in obtaining and improving profitability. If we are not able to access capital at competitive rates, the ability to implement our business plans may be adversely affected. In the absence of access to capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations at times when the prices for such assets or operations are depressed. In such event, we may not be able to consummate those dispositions. Furthermore, the proceeds of any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations when due.\nOur ability to comply with the restrictive covenants contained in our debt instruments, to make scheduled payments on our existing or future debt obligations, and to fund our operations will depend on our future financial and operating performance. Such performance is, to a significant extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. If assumptions regarding our production, sales and subsequent collections from certain of our large customers, as well as customer deposits and revenues generated from new customer orders, are materially inconsistent with actual results, or any future restructuring efforts are not successful, we may encounter cash flow and liquidity issues. Additionally, new or existing customers may request acceleration of production or we may accept new orders or modify existing orders to purchase steel opportunistically or to build products with deposits, which will reduce our liquidity. There can be no assurances that our operations will generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to maintain compliance with the restrictive covenants contained in our debt instruments, pay our remaining indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, among other things, our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable which could force us to liquidate certain assets or alter our business operations or debt obligations, and we could be forced into a restructuring, bankruptcy or liquidation. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do any of the foregoing on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders. In addition, raising capital in the equity capital markets could result in limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards.\nBorrowings under our Credit Facility and other variable rate indebtedness may use the London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted, but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness causing a negative impact on our financial position and operating results.\nWe are substantially dependent on a few significant customers.\nHistorically, the majority of our revenues are highly concentrated with a limited number of customers. In 2018, two customers, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (\u201cSGRE\u201d) and Gardner Denver, accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues, and our five largest customers accounted for 78% of our consolidated revenues. Certain of our customers periodically have expressed their intent to scale back, delay or restructure existing customer agreements, which has led to reduced revenues from these customers. It is possible that this may occur again in the future. As a result, our operating profits and gross margins have historically been negatively affected by significant variability in production levels, which has created production volume inefficiencies in our operations and cost structures.\nThe U.S. wind energy industry is significantly impacted by tax and other economic incentives and political and governmental policies. A significant change in these incentives and policies could significantly impact our results of operations and growth.\nWe sell towers to wind turbine manufacturers who supply wind energy generation facilities. The U.S. wind energy industry is significantly impacted by federal tax incentives and state Renewable Portfolio Standards (\u201cRPS\u2019s\u201d). Despite recent reductions in the cost of wind energy, due to variability in wind quality and consistency, and other regional differences, wind energy may not be economically viable in certain parts of the country absent such incentives. These programs have provided material incentives to develop wind energy generation facilities and thereby impact the demand for our products. The increased demand for our products that generally results from the credits and incentives could be impacted by the expiration or curtailment of these programs.\nOne such federal government program, the PTC, provides economic incentives to the owners of wind energy facilities in the form of a tax credit. The PTC has been extended several times since its initial introduction in 1992. The FY16 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, passed on December 18, 2015, included a five-year extension and phase-down of the PTC, as well as providing the option to elect the ITC for wind energy projects. As a result, the PTC has been extended at full value for projects commenced by the end of 2016, was reduced to 80% of full value for projects commenced in 2017, 60% for projects commended in 2018, and 40% for projects commenced in 2019. Similarly, for the ITC election, projects that started construction in 2015 and 2016 are eligible for a full 30% ITC, and projects that start construction in 2017, 2018 and 2019 are eligible for an ITC of 24%, 18% and 12%, respectively. As before, the rules allow wind energy projects to qualify so long as construction is started before the end of the respective period and either completed within three years, or under continuous construction between the start date and completion. The PTC tax benefits are available for the first ten years of operation of a wind energy facility, and also applies to significant redevelopment of existing wind energy facilities.\nRPSs generally require or encourage state regulated electric utilities to supply a certain proportion of electricity from renewable energy sources or to devote a certain portion of their plant capacity to renewable energy generation. Typically, utilities comply with such standards by qualifying for renewable energy credits evidencing the share of electricity that was produced from renewable sources. Under many state standards, these renewable energy credits can be unbundled from their associated energy and traded in a market system, allowing generators with insufficient credits to meet their applicable state mandate. These standards have spurred significant growth in the wind energy industry and a corresponding increase in the demand for our products. Currently, the majority of states have RPS\u2019s in place and certain states have voluntary utility commitments to supply a specific percentage of their electricity from renewable sources. The enactment of RPS\u2019s in additional states or any changes to existing RPS\u2019s (including changes due to the failure to extend or renew the federal incentives described above), or the enactment of a federal RPS or imposition of other greenhouse gas regulations, may impact the demand for our products. We cannot assure that government support for renewable energy will continue. The elimination of, or reduction in, state or federal government policies that support renewable energy could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial performance and future development efforts.\nNew tariffs have resulted in increased prices and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The Trump Administration imposed Section 232 tariffs on certain steel products imported into the U.S. which have increased the prices of these inputs. Increased prices for imported steel products have lead domestic sellers to respond with market-based increases to prices for such inputs as well. Additional tariffs have been announced that may be imposed on goods imported from China in the future. The new tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S. or other countries, could result in further increased prices and a decreased available supply of steel as well as additional imported components and inputs. We may not be able to pass price increases on to our customers and may not be able to secure adequate alternative sources of steel on a timely basis. While retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact, we cannot predict further developments.\nU.S. tariffs have been imposed on imported steel, but have not been applied to fabricated wind towers, which has adversely impacted our cost structure and competitiveness relative to imported towers. This has contributed to a general decrease in tower margins, which has reduced the profitability of our business.\nThe existence of government subsidies available to our competitors in certain countries may affect our ability to compete on a price basis.\nIn 2013, the U.S. International Trade Commission (\u201cUSITC\u201d) determined that wind towers from China and Vietnam were being sold in the U.S. at less than fair value. As a result of that determination, the U.S. Department of Commerce (\u201cUSDOC\u201d) issued antidumping and countervailing duty orders on imports of wind towers from China and an antidumping duty order on imports of towers from Vietnam. Since that time, imports of wind towers from those countries have substantially ceased. Those orders expired in 2018 and are currently under review for a five-year extension. There can be no assurance that they will be renewed or extended. Additionally, producers in other countries not subject to those orders may benefit from government subsidies (particularly with respect to the price of steel, the primary raw material used in the production of wind towers) which could lead to increased competition from those producers in the U.S. market, causing us to lose market share and/or reducing our margins.\nOur customers may be significantly affected by disruptions and volatility in the economy and in the wind energy market.\nMarket disruptions and regular market volatility, including decreases in oil and commodity prices, may adversely impact our customers\u2019 ability to pay amounts due to us and could cause related increases in our working capital or borrowing needs. In addition, our customers have in the past attempted and may attempt in the future to renegotiate the terms of contracts or reduce the size of orders with us as a result of disruptions and volatility in the markets. We cannot predict with certainty the amount of our backlog that we will ultimately ship to our customers.\nMarket disruptions and regular market volatility may also result in an increased likelihood of our customers asserting warranty or remediation claims in connection with our products that they would not ordinarily assert in a more stable economic environment. In the event of such a claim, we may incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or to engage in litigation with the affected customer regarding the claim. We maintain product liability insurance, but there can be no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against such claims. A successful claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nConsolidation among wind turbine manufacturers could increase our customer concentration and/or disrupt our supply chain relationships.\nWind turbine manufacturers are among our primary customers. There has been consolidation among these manufacturers, and more consolidation may occur in the future. For example, both Siemens and Gamesa were customers for our tower business until their business combination in early 2017, at which time SGRE became our largest customer. Customer consolidation may result in pricing pressures, to which we are subject, leading to downward pressure on our margins and profits, and may also disrupt our supply chain relationships.\nWe face competition from industry participants who may have greater resources than we do.\nOur businesses are subject to risks associated with competition from new or existing industry participants who may have more resources and better access to capital. Certain of our competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial resources, customer support, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do. Among other things, these industry participants compete with us based upon price, quality, location and available capacity. We cannot be sure that we will have the resources or expertise to compete successfully in the future. We also cannot be sure that we will be able to match cost reductions by our competitors or that we will be able to succeed in the face of current or future competition.\nWe face significant risks associated with uncertainties resulting from changes to policies and laws with the periodic changes in the U.S. administration as well as risks associated with changes in our relationship with our significant customers.\nChanges of administration in the U.S. federal government may affect our business in a manner that currently cannot be reliably predicted, especially given the potentially significant changes to various laws and regulations that affect us. These uncertainties may include changes in laws and policies in areas such as corporate taxation, taxation on imports of internationally-sourced products, international trade including trade treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, environmental protection and workplace safety laws, labor and employment law, immigration and health care, which individually or in the aggregate could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAdditionally, if our relationships with significant customers should change materially, it could be difficult for us to immediately and profitably replace lost sales in a market with such concentration, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results. We could be adversely impacted by decreased customer demand for our products due to (i) the impact of current or future economic conditions on our customers, (ii) our customers\u2019 loss of market share to their competitors that do not use our products, and (iii) our loss of market share with our customers. We could lose market share with our customers to our competitors or to our customers themselves, should they decide to become more vertically integrated and produce the products that we currently provide.\nIn addition, even if our customers continue to do business with us, we could be adversely affected by a number of other potential developments with our customers. For example:\n\u00b7\nThe inability or failure of our customers to meet their contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\n\u00b7\nCertain customer contracts provide the customer with the opportunity to cancel a substantial portion of its volume obligation by providing us with notice of such election prior to commencement of production. Such contracts generally require the customer to pay a sliding cancelation fee based on how far in advance of commencement of production such notice is provided.\n\u00b7\nIf we are unable to deliver products to our customers in accordance with an agreed upon schedule we may become subject to liquidated damages provisions in certain supply agreements for the period of time we are unable to deliver finished products. Although the liquidated damages provisions are generally capped, they can become significant and may have a negative impact on our profit margins and financial results.\n\u00b7\nA material change in payment terms with a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our short term cash flows.\nOur plans for growth, diversification, and restructuring may not be successful, and could result in poor financial performance.\nThe Company continues to strategically diversify, restructure and grow the business to improve operational efficiency and meet customer demand. Our diversification efforts further into the natural gas turbine (\u201cNGT\u201d) power generation, O&G, mining and other industries, particularly within our gearing and Heavy Fabrications businesses and through our 2017 acquisition of Red Wolf, may require additional investments in personnel, equipment and operational infrastructure. Moreover, although we have historically participated in most of these lines of business, there is no assurance that we will be able to grow our presence in these markets at a rate sufficient to compensate for a potentially weaker wind energy market. If we are unable to further penetrate these markets, our plans to diversify our operations may not be successful and our anticipated future growth may be adversely affected.\nOur restructuring efforts, including the 2018 restructuring plan, may involve occasionally opening or closing facilities to rationalize facility capacity and management structure, and consolidating and increasing efficiencies in certain operations. If the Company is unable to generate anticipated costs savings or successfully implement its strategies, the Company\u2019s financial results could suffer. These efforts and strategies could also have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s relationships, including those with its employees or customers, which could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nOur growth efforts through increased production levels at existing facilities, acquisitions and continuous improvement activities such as the proper coordination and integration of the supply chain, the consistent use of systems with respect to production activities, the Advanced Product Quality Processes (APQP) to support the introduction of new products, and the hiring of continuous improvement experts to optimize our production processes, will require coordinated efforts across the Company and continued enhancements to our current operating infrastructure. If the cost of making these changes increases or if our efforts are unsuccessful, the Company may not realize anticipated benefits and our future earnings may be adversely affected.\nIf our projections regarding the future market demand for our products are inaccurate, our operating results and our overall business may be adversely affected.\nWe have previously made significant capital investments in anticipation of rapid growth in the U.S. wind energy market. However, the growth in the U.S. wind energy market has not kept pace with our expectations when some of these capital investments were made, and there can be no assurance that the U.S. wind energy market will grow and develop in a manner consistent with our expectations, or that we will be able to fill our capacity through the further diversification of our operations. Our internal manufacturing capabilities have required significant upfront fixed costs. If market demand for our products does not increase at the pace we have anticipated and align with our manufacturing capacity, we may be unable to offset these costs and achieve economies of scale, and our operating results may continue to be adversely affected by high fixed costs, reduced margins and underutilization of capacity which may cause us to continue to incur significant losses and may prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability. In light of these considerations, we may be forced to reduce our labor force and production to minimum levels, as was done at certain operating locations in both 2017 and 2018, temporarily idle existing capacity or sell to third parties manufacturing capacity that we cannot utilize in the near term, in addition to the steps that we have already taken to adjust our capacity more closely to demand. Alternatively, if we experience rapid increased demand for our products in excess of our estimates, or we reduce our manufacturing capacity, our installed capital equipment and existing workforce may be insufficient to support higher production volumes, which could adversely affect our customer relationships and overall reputation. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a timely manner, procure adequate resources or locate suitable third party suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers, and our business could be adversely affected. Our ability to meet such excess customer demand could also depend on our ability to raise additional capital and effectively scale our manufacturing operations.\nOur growth strategies could be ineffective due to the risks of acquisitions and risks relating to integration.\nOur growth strategy has included acquiring complementary businesses, such as Red Wolf, as more fully described in Note 21, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. In regards to Red Wolf, or any other future acquisitions, we could fail to identify, finance or complete suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms and prices. Acquisitions and the related integration processes could increase a number of risks, including diversion of operations personnel, financial personnel and management\u2019s attention, difficulties in integrating systems and operations, potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies and exposure to unanticipated liabilities. The price we pay for a business may exceed the value realized and we cannot provide any assurance that we will realize the expected synergies and benefits of any acquisition, including Red Wolf. Our discovery of, or failure to discover, material issues during due diligence investigations of acquisition targets, either before closing with regard to potential risks of the acquired operations, or after closing with regard to the timely discovery of breaches of representations or warranties, could materially harm our business. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating a new business to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition could cause an interruption or loss of momentum in our existing activities and could adversely affect our profitability. Acquisitions also may result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our financial position and operating results.\nOur diversification outside of the wind energy market exposes us to business risks associated with the gas turbine, oil and gas, and mining industries, among others, which may slow our growth or penetration in these markets.\nAlthough we have experience in the gas turbine, oil and gas and mining industry markets, these markets have not historically been our primary focus. In further diversifying our business to serve these markets, we face competitors who may have more resources, longer operating histories and more well established relationships than we do, and we may not be able to successfully or profitably generate additional business opportunities in these industries. Moreover, if we are able to successfully diversify into these markets, our businesses may be exposed to risks associated with these industries, which could adversely affect our future earnings and growth. These risks include, among other things:\n\u00b7\nthe prices and relative demand for oil, gas, minerals and other commodities;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and global political and economic conditions affecting the O&G and mining industries;\n\u00b7\nchanges in technology;\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources, as well as changes in energy consumption or supply; and\n\u00b7\nfederal, state and local regulations, including, among others, regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing and greenhouse gas emissions.\nWe have substantially generated net losses since our inception.\nWe have experienced operating losses since inception, except that we were profitable in 2016. We have incurred significant costs in connection with the development of our businesses, and because we have operated at low capacity utilization in certain facilities, there is no assurance that we will generate sufficient revenues to offset anticipated operating costs. Although we anticipate deriving revenues from the sale of our products, no assurance can be given that these products can be sold on a profitable basis. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.\nWe may continue to incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors.\nCurrent or future litigation and regulatory actions could have a material adverse impact on us.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business. No assurance can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of lawsuits, investigations or arbitrations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Defending ourselves in these matters may be time consuming, expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and may result in significant expense and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business, which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives. Additionally, any amount that we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment or settlement may not be covered by insurance. Under our charter and the indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our officers, directors and certain third parties, we are required to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with their participation in certain proceedings. There can be no assurance that any of these payments will not be material.\nWe may need to hire additional qualified personnel, including management personnel, and the loss of our key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur future success will depend largely on the skills, efforts and motivation of our executive officers and other key personnel. Our success also depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management and other key personnel throughout our organization. We face competition in the attraction and retention of personnel who possess the skill sets we seek. In addition, key personnel may leave us and subsequently compete against us. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe rely on unionized labor, the loss of which could adversely affect our future success.\nWe depend on the services of unionized labor and have collective bargaining agreements with certain of our operations workforce at our Cicero, Illinois and Neville Island, Pennsylvania Gearing facilities. The loss of the services of these and other personnel, whether through terminations, attrition, labor strike or otherwise, or a material change in our collective bargaining agreements, could have a material adverse impact on us and our future profitability. In November 2017, a five-year collective bargaining agreement was ratified by the collective bargaining union in our Neville Island facility and is expected to remain in effect through October 2022. A new four-year collective bargaining agreement with the Cicero union was negotiated in the third quarter of 2018 and is expected to remain in effect through February 2022. As of December 31, 2018, these collective bargaining units represented approximately 23% of our workforce.\nWe could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental, health and safety (\u201cEHS\u201d) laws and regulations and to address violations of or liabilities under these requirements.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of EHS laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and sell products governing, among other things, health, safety, pollution and protection of the environment and natural resources, including the use, handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous materials and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, groundwater and soil, product content, performance and packaging. We cannot guarantee that we have been, or will at all times be in compliance with such laws and regulations. Changes in existing EHS laws and regulations, or their application, could cause us to incur additional or unexpected costs to achieve or maintain compliance. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, obtain the necessary permits to operate our business, or comply with the terms and conditions of such permits may subject us to a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the imposition of civil and criminal sanctions, monetary fines and penalties, remedial obligations, and the issuance of compliance requirements limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. The assertion of claims relating to regulatory compliance, on or off site contamination, natural resource damage, the discovery of previously unknown environmental liabilities, the imposition of criminal or civil fines or penalties and/or other sanctions, or the obligation to undertake investigation, remediation or monitoring activities could result in potentially significant costs and expenditures to address contamination or resolve claims or liabilities. Such costs and expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Under certain circumstances, violation of such EHS laws and regulations could result in us being disqualified from eligibility to receive federal government contracts or subcontracts under the federal government\u2019s debarment and suspension system.\nWe also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of currently and formerly owned, leased or operated properties, or properties to which hazardous substances or wastes were sent by current or former operators at our current or former facilities, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. Several of our facilities have a history of industrial operations, and contaminants have been detected at some of our facilities. The presence of contamination from hazardous substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or use our properties as collateral for financing. We also could be held liable under third party claims for property damage, natural resource damage or personal injury and for penalties and other damages under such environmental laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to comply with regulatory requirements is critical to our future success, and there can be no guarantee that our businesses are in full compliance with all such requirements.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of wind and other energy industry products we are subject to the requirements of federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to a number of industry standard setting authorities, such as the American Gear Manufacturers Association and the American Welding Society. Changes in the standards and requirements imposed by such authorities could have a material adverse effect on us. In the event we are unable to meet any such standards when adopted, our businesses could be adversely affected. We may not be able to obtain all regulatory approvals, licenses and permits that may be required in the future, or any necessary modifications to existing regulatory approvals, licenses and permits, or maintain all required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits. There can be no guarantee that our businesses are fully compliant with such standards and requirements.\nWe may be unable to keep pace with rapidly changing technology in wind turbine and other industrial component manufacturing.\nThe global market for wind turbines, as well as for our other manufactured industrial components, is rapidly evolving technologically. Our component manufacturing equipment and technology may not be suited for future generations of products being developed by wind turbine companies. As turbines grow in size, tower manufacturing becomes more complicated and may require investments in new manufacturing equipment. For example, some wind turbine manufacturers are using wind turbine towers made partially or fully from concrete instead of steel. To maintain a successful business in our field, we must keep pace with technological developments and the changing standards of our customers and potential customers and meet their constantly evolving demands. If we fail to adequately respond to the technological changes in our industry, or are not suited to provide components for new types of wind turbines, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nDisruptions in the supply of parts and raw materials, or changes in supplier relations, may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe are dependent upon the supply of certain raw materials used in our production process, and these raw materials are exposed to price fluctuations on the open market. Raw material costs for materials such as steel, our primary raw material, have fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, we have generally tried to match raw material purchases to our sales contracts or incorporated price adjustment clauses in our contracts. However, limitations on availability of raw materials or increases in the cost of raw materials (including steel), energy, transportation and other necessary services may impact our operating results if our manufacturing businesses are not able to fully pass on the costs associated with such increases to their respective customers. Alternatively, we will not realize material improvements from any decline in steel prices as the terms of our contracts generally require that we pass these cost savings through to our customers. In addition, we may encounter supplier constraints, be unable to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or be affected by disruptions in the supply chain caused by events such as natural disasters, shipping delays, power outages and labor strikes. Additionally, our supply chain has become more global in nature and, thus, more complex from a shipping and logistics perspective. In the event of limitations on availability of raw materials or significant changes in the cost of raw materials, particularly steel, our margins and profitability could be negatively impacted.\nIf our estimates for warranty expenses differ materially from actual claims made, or if we are unable to reasonably estimate future warranty expense for our products, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe provide warranty terms generally ranging between one and five years to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer agreement. We reserve for warranty claims based on prior experience and estimates made by management based upon a percentage of our sales revenues related to such products. From time to time, customers have submitted warranty claims to us. However, we have a limited history on which to base our warranty estimates for certain of our manufactured products. Our assumptions could materially differ from the actual performance of our products in the future and could exceed the levels against which we have reserved. In some instances our customers have interpreted the scope and coverage of certain of our warranty provisions differently from our interpretation of such provisions. The expenses associated with remediation activities in the wind energy industry can be substantial, and if we are required to pay such costs in connection with a customer\u2019s warranty claim, we could be subject to additional unplanned cash expenditures. If our estimates prove materially incorrect, or if we are required to cover remediation expenses in addition to our regular warranty coverage, we could be required to incur additional expenses and could face a material unplanned cash expenditure, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to produce, maintain and disseminate relevant and/or reliable data and information pertaining to our business in an efficient, cost-effective, secure and well-controlled fashion and avoid security breaches affecting our information technology systems, such inability may have significant negative impacts on our confidentiality obligations, and proprietary needs and therefore on our future operations, profitability and competitive position.\nManagement relies on information technology infrastructure and architecture, including hardware, network, software, people and processes, to provide useful and confidential information to conduct our business in the ordinary course, including correspondence and commercial data and information interchange with customers, suppliers, consultants, advisors and governmental agencies, and to support assessments and conclusions about future plans and initiatives pertaining to market demands, operating performance and competitive positioning.\nThere has been an increase in global cybersecurity threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human and technological errors. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, including through the use of protective systems, monitoring and testing and employee training, any material failure, interruption of service, compromised data security, computer virus or cybersecurity threat or attack could adversely affect our relations with suppliers and customers, place us in violation of confidentiality and data protection laws, rules and regulations, and result in negative impacts to our reputation, market share, operations and profitability. Despite our use of measures to protect our systems and confidential information, security breaches, human or technological error or other failures in our information technology could result in theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property which could materially and adversely impact our future results.\nFuture sales of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock may depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, may reduce the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities and may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their common stock at a time and price that they deem appropriate.\nOn August 11, 2017, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-219931), which was declared effective by the SEC on October 10, 2017, to register securities that we may choose to issue in the future (the \u201cBroadwind Form S-3\u201d). Under the registration statement, we have the option to offer and sell up to $50,000 in the aggregate of securities in one or more offerings. On July 31, 2018, we entered into a $10,000 At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the \u201cATM Agreement\u201d) with Roth Capital Partners, LLC. During 2018, the Company issued 15,112 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock under the ATM Agreement and the net proceeds (before upfront costs) to the Company from the sale of the Company\u2019s common stock were approximately $33 after deducting commissions paid of approximately $1. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $9,967 remained available for issuance with respect to the ATM Agreement.\nThere is a limited trading market for our securities and the market price of our securities is subject to volatility.\nOur common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The absence of an active trading market increases price volatility and reduces the liquidity of our common stock. The market price and level of trading of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, our limited trading volume, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, the nature and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our business and the general state of the securities market, as well as general economic, political and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results. In 2018, the price of our common stock varied from a high of $3.15 per share to a low of $1.20 per share. Stockholders may have incurred substantial losses with regard to any investment in our common stock adversely affecting stockholder confidence.\nLimitations on our ability to utilize our net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) may negatively affect our financial results.\nWe may not be able to utilize all of our NOLs. For financial statement presentation, all benefits associated with the NOL carryforwards have been reserved; therefore, this potential asset is not reflected on our balance sheet. To the extent available, we will use any NOL carryforwards to reduce the U.S. corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. However, if we do not achieve profitability prior to their expiration, we will not be able to fully utilize our NOLs to offset income. Section 382 of the IRC (\u201cSection 382\u201d) generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOL carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone certain changes in stock ownership. Our ability to utilize NOL carryforwards and built in losses may be limited, under Section 382 or otherwise, by our issuance of common stock or by other changes in ownership of our stock. After analyzing Section 382 in 2010 we determined that aggregate changes in our stock ownership had triggered an annual limitation of NOL carryforwards and built in losses available for utilization to $14,284 per annum. Although this event limited the amount of pre ownership change date NOLs and built in losses we can utilize annually, it does not preclude us from fully utilizing our current NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration. However, subsequent changes in our stock ownership could further limit our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and our income could be subject to taxation earlier than it would if we were able to use NOL carryforwards and built in losses without an annual limitation, which could result in lower profits. To address these concerns, in February 2013 we adopted a Section 382 Stockholder Rights Plan, which was subsequently approved by our stockholders and extended in 2016 for an additional three-year period (as amended, the \u201cRights Plan\u201d), designed to preserve our substantial tax assets associated with NOL carryforwards under Section 382. The Rights Plan is intended to deter any person or group from being or becoming the beneficial owner of 4.9% or more of our common stock and thereby triggering a further limitation of our available NOL carryforwards. On February 7, 2019, the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) approved an amendment extending the Rights Plan for an additional three years. The amendment is subject to approval by our stockholders at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. See Note 14, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our Rights Plan. There can be no assurance that our stockholders will ratify the extension of the Rights Plan or that the Rights Plan will be effective in protecting our NOL carryforwards.", "PERMNO": 92917, "SIC": 3510, "TIC": "BWEN"}
