{"cik": "1471261", "company": "Cobalt International Energy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, business prospects, stock price, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect us. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola is subject to Angolan government approval, and such sale may be delayed or may not be consummated. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement governing such sale, we are obligated to transfer our interests in Block 20 and 21 prior to receipt of all consideration for such transfer.\nOn August 22, 2015, we executed a purchase and sale agreement (the \"Purchase and Sale Agreement\") with Sociedade Nacional de Combust\u00edveis de Angola-Empresa P\u00fablica (\"Sonangol\") for the sale to Sonangol of the share capital of certain of our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries which hold our working interests in each of Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola. The consummation of this sale is subject to approval by the Angolan Ministry of Petroleum pursuant to the Angolan Petroleum Activities Law. If such approval is not received within one year from the execution date of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, this agreement will automatically terminate and any obligations executed by the parties thereto shall be restituted in order to put such parties in their original positions as if no agreement had been executed. There can be no assurance that such Angolan government approval will be forthcoming within the required time period. In addition, the closing of the sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 could be delayed or ultimately not consummated for a variety of reasons, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the closing of the sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 is not consummated or is delayed indefinitely, we would need to renegotiate our license agreements governing Blocks 20 and 21 with Sonangol to provide for adjusted development schedules and other timelines. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate such agreements on favorable terms or at all. Such failure could materially adversely affect the value of such licenses. In addition, the Angolan government passed Presidential Decree No. 212/15 on December 2, 2015, which established a new Block 20/15 concession area covering our Lontra discovery. Such Presidential Decree ostensibly conflicts with our rights to develop oil from the Lontra discovery under the Block 20 PSC. Accordingly, it is unclear what effect the passage of this Presidential Decree has on our rights to develop Lontra under the Block 20 PSC, although we are working with Sonangol to understand its significance given the pending Angola Transaction. Should the closing of the sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 be delayed or ultimately not consummated, we would need to resolve this potential conflict caused by the Presidential Decree. Any such resolution may not be favorable to us. As such, failure to consummate the closing of the sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our ability to service and/or repay our substantial existing indebtedness.\nPursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we are required to provide certain transition services to Sonangol, which may include continuing to support operations on Blocks 20 and 21 on a no-profit no-loss basis until Sonangol nominates a new operator or operators of such blocks, despite the fact that we may have already transferred the share capital of our subsidiaries holding our working interests in Blocks 20 and 21 to Sonangol. The duration of this transition period could be lengthy and require us to devote a substantial amount of resources to maintain operations on Blocks 20 and 21, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations, and we may not be indemnified against any losses or liabilities that we may incur during the transition period. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that Sonangol will be able to nominate a new operator(s) for such blocks in a timely manner, which may delay the timing of required Angolan government approvals and the consummation of the sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21.\nThe consideration payable by Sonangol for our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 is to be paid in three installments. Should Angolan government approval for the sale be obtained, and should Sonangol pay the first two installments and reimburse us for our share of the costs attributable to Blocks 20 and 21 from the period from January 1, 2015 through the date upon which we receive the Angolan government approvals, we are obligated under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement to transfer the share capital of our subsidiaries holding our working interests in Blocks 20 and 21 to Sonangol. The third installment, in an amount of $200 million, is due within the earlier of 30 days following the execution of a transfer of operations agreement, which will contain terms and conditions governing the transition of operations on each of Block 20 and Block 21 from us to a new operator(s), or one year from the execution of the Purchase and Sale Agreement. This third installment may not become payable until after the consummation of the transfer of our working interests. Should this occur, we would be subject to the risk that such third installment amount is not paid in full, or at all, or becomes subject to renegotiation. The Purchase and Sale Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Angola and requires any disputes thereunder to be settled by arbitration. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in enforcing our rights under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Any delays in the receipt, or failure to receive, the full amount of the consideration set forth in the Purchase and Sale Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our ability to service and/or repay our substantial existing indebtedness.\nContinuation of the recent decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOil and gas prices are in the midst of a severe and prolonged downturn. The significant decline in oil and gas prices over the past eighteen months has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and market price of our common stock. The price that we receive for our oil and natural gas production affects our revenue, profitability, liquidity, access to capital and future growth rate. Historically, the oil and natural gas markets have been volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. For example, daily settlement prices for New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate oil ranged from a high of $61.43 per barrel to a low of $34.73 per barrel during 2015. Daily settlement prices for NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas ranged from a high of $3.23 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) to a low of $1.76 per MMBtu during 2015. Recently, oil and natural gas prices have experienced an even further severe decline. Oil and natural gas prices depend on numerous factors, all of which are out of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nchanges in supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe actions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u00b7\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nspeculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil futures contracts;\n\u00b7\nglobal economic conditions, including the strength of the U.S. dollar;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic conditions, including embargoes, in oil-producing countries or affecting other oil-producing activities, particularly in the Middle East, Africa, Russia and South America;\n\u00b7\nthe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including U.S. military operations in the Middle East;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories and oil and natural gas refining capacities;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions and other natural disasters;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u00b7\nproximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas; and\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nSignificant declines in oil and natural gas prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business:\n\u00b7\nlimiting our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance our capital expenditures and results of operations;\n\u00b7\nreducing the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically;\n\u00b7\ncausing us to delay, postpone or terminate our exploration, appraisal and development activities;\n\u00b7\nreducing any future revenues, operating income and cash flows;\n\u00b7\nreducing the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties; or\n\u00b7\nlimiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt.\nOil and natural gas prices have declined dramatically from mid-2014 and will likely continue to be depressed and volatile in the future. There can be no assurance that oil and natural gas prices will rebound in the near term or at all. Continuation of the substantial and extended decline in oil and natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness, which may increase over time, could reduce our financial flexibility.\nWe have $2.68 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes (the \u201cnotes\u201d) outstanding and have entered into a $150 million senior secured reserve-based loan. We are able to incur significant additional indebtedness pursuant to these debt instruments in the future in order to make investments or acquisitions or to explore, appraise or develop our oil and natural gas assets. In addition to our debt obligations, we have a substantial amount of contractual commitments pursuant to our license and lease agreements and rig contracts, among other things. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u00b7\na significant portion or all of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;\n\u00b7\na high level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, such as the recent severe and prolonged downturn in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\na high level of indebtedness may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness could prevent us from pursuing; and\n\u00b7\na high level of indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for our development projects, exploration drilling program, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes.\nA high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions, risks associated with exploring for and producing oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. For example, oil and gas prices have recently been in the midst of a severe and prolonged downturn, which may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201c-Continuation of the recent extended decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our equity securities or a refinancing of our indebtedness include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital. In particular, weakness in the financial markets or other financing sources, due to recent significant declines in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, may delay or prevent us from accessing additional funding sources to refinance and/or service our existing indebtedness. Further, our liquidity and financial condition may be adversely affected if we are\nunable to consummate key operational transactions, including our sale of our working interests in Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola. See \u201c-The sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola is subject to Angolan government approval, and such sale may be delayed or may not be consummated. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement governing such sale, we are obligated to transfer our interests in Block 20 and 21 prior to receipt of all consideration for such transfer.\u201d If any of these adverse conditions occur or continue, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such indebtedness.\nFailure to effectively execute our appraisal and development projects could result in significant delays and/or cost over-runs, including the delay of any future production, which could negatively impact our operating results, liquidity and financial position.\nAll of our appraisal and development projects are in the early stages of the project development life-cycle, except for our Heidelberg project. Our development projects and discoveries will require substantial additional evaluation and analysis, including appraisal drilling and the expenditure of substantial amounts of capital, prior to preparing a development plan and seeking formal project sanction. First production from these development projects and discoveries is not expected for several years, with the exception of our Heidelberg project which only recently began producing oil and gas. All of our development projects and discoveries are located in challenging deepwater environments and, given the magnitude and scale of the initial discoveries, will entail significant technical and financial challenges, including extensive subsea tiebacks to production facilities, pressure maintenance systems, gas re-injection systems, and other specialized infrastructure. This may include the advancement of technology and equipment necessary to withstand the higher pressures associated with producing oil and gas from Inboard Lower Tertiary horizons.\nThis level of development activity and complexity requires significant effort from our management and technical personnel and places additional requirements on our financial resources and internal financial controls. In addition, we have increased dependency on third-party technology and service providers and other supply chain participants for these complex projects. We may not be able to fully execute these projects due to:\n\u00b7\nthe timing or occurrence of the closing of the sale of our interests in Block 20 and 21 offshore Angola;\n\u00b7\npersistent low oil and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\ninability to obtain sufficient and timely financing;\n\u00b7\ninability to attract and/or retain sufficient quantity of personnel with the skills required to bring these complex projects to production on schedule and on budget;\n\u00b7\nsignificant delays in delivery of essential items or performance of services, cost overruns, supplier insolvency, or other critical supply failure could adversely affect project development;\n\u00b7\ninability to advance certain technologies;\n\u00b7\nlack of partner or government approval for projects;\n\u00b7\ncivil disturbances, anti-development activities, legal challenges or other interruptions which could prevent access; and\n\u00b7\ndrilling hazards or accidents or natural disasters.\nWe may not be able to compensate for, or fully mitigate, these risks.\nOur business plan requires substantial additional capital, which we may be unable to raise on acceptable terms in the future, which may in turn limit our ability to execute our development projects and achieve production, conduct exploration activities or renew our exploration portfolio.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not generate any revenue from operations and only recently began producing oil and gas. Our capital outlays and operating expenditures will increase substantially over at least the next several years as we expand our operations and will vastly exceed the revenue we receive from our oil and gas operations. Developing major offshore oil and gas projects, especially in complex and challenging environments, continuing exploration activities and obtaining additional leases or concessional licenses and seismic data are very expensive, and we expect that we will need to raise substantial additional capital, through future private or public equity offerings, asset sales, strategic alliances or debt or project financing. The recent significant and sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to consummate key sales or acquisitions, including the sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola;\n\u00b7\nthe performance of the producing wells on our Heidelberg development;\n\u00b7\nthe scope, rate of progress and cost of our exploration, appraisal and development activities;\n\u00b7\nlack of partner participation in exploration, appraisal or development operations;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which we invest in additional oil leases or concessional licenses;\n\u00b7\noil and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\nour ability to locate and acquire hydrocarbon reserves;\n\u00b7\nour ability to produce oil or natural gas from those reserves;\n\u00b7\nour ability to meet the timelines for development set forth in our leases;\n\u00b7\nthe terms and timing of any drilling and other production-related arrangements that we may enter into; and\n\u00b7\nthe timing of partner and governmental approvals and/or concessions.\nIf the closing of the Angola Transaction is delayed, or if the Angola Transaction is ultimately not consummated, we may be forced to raise a substantial amount of capital. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, due to our substantial level of indebtedness, the recent severe and continuing downturn in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise. Even if we succeed in selling additional securities to raise funds, at such time the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders could be diluted, and new investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the financing may involve covenants that restrict our business activities. If we choose to farm-out interests in our leases or licenses, we would dilute our ownership interest subject to the farm-out and any potential value resulting therefrom, and we may lose operating control over such prospects.\nIn response to the recent decline in oil and gas prices, certain of our partners have announced significant capital expenditure reductions, which may cause such partners to elect not to participate in the drilling of a particular exploration or appraisal well with us. This could dramatically increase our share of the costs of such operation and may cause us to cancel or delay certain operations and may materially adversely impact our liquidity and results of operations.\nIn order to protect our exploration and production rights in our license areas, we must meet various drilling and declaration requirements. Assuming we are able to commence exploration and production activities or successfully exploit our properties during the primary license term, our licenses over the developed areas of a prospect could extend beyond the primary term, generally for the life of production. However, unless we make and declare discoveries within certain time periods specified in the documents governing our licenses, our interests in either the undeveloped parts of our license areas (as is the case in Angola and Gabon) or the whole block (as is the case in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico) may be forfeited, we may be subject to significant penalties or be required to make additional payments in order to maintain such licenses. The costs to maintain licenses may fluctuate and may increase significantly since the original term, and we may not be able to renew or extend such licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are not successful in raising additional capital, we may be unable to execute our development projects, continue our exploration activities or successfully exploit our properties, and we may lose the rights to develop these properties upon the expiration of our licenses.\nThe productivity of the Heidelberg field is uncertain, and the production rates achieved from the initial development wells drilled at Heidelberg may be materially lower than expectations.\nThe productivity of the Heidelberg field is uncertain and the production rates achieved from the initial development wells drilled at Heidelberg may be materially lower than expectations. Oil and gas production from the Heidelberg field commenced in January 2016 and it may take a significant amount of time to ramp up production. Production rates from deepwater oil and gas developments may deviate substantially from expectations due to a variety of factors, including unforeseen geologic complexities, inability to maintain adequate pressures within the field reservoir, and failure or non-performance of key production equipment and infrastructure, including production facilities. Deepwater oil and gas developments are extremely complex and the downside risks to production levels are especially acute in the early stages of production. If we realize lower production rates than expected from Heidelberg, this may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe have limited proved reserves and areas that we decide to drill may not yield hydrocarbons in commercial quantities or quality, or at all.\nWe have limited proved reserves and our exploration portfolio consists of identified yet unproven exploration prospects based on available seismic and geological information that indicates the potential presence of hydrocarbons. The exploration, appraisal and development wells we drill may not yield hydrocarbons in commercial quantities or quality, or at all. In addition, while our exploration efforts are oil-focused, any well we drill may discover gas or other hydrocarbons, which, in the case of Angola, we may not have rights to develop or produce. Even when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. We have drilled a limited number of appraisal wells on our discoveries. Undue reliance should not be placed on our limited drilling results or any estimates of the characteristics of our projects or prospects, including any derived calculations of our potential resources or reserves based on these limited results and estimates. Additional appraisal wells, other testing and production data from completed wells will be required to fully appraise our discoveries, to better estimate their characteristics and potential resources and reserves and to ultimately understand their commerciality and economic viability. Accordingly, we do not know how many of our development projects, discoveries or exploration prospects will contain hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities or quality to recover drilling and completion costs or to be economically viable. Even if hydrocarbons are found on our exploration prospects in commercial quantities, construction costs of oil pipelines, production platforms, facilities or subsea infrastructure, as applicable, and transportation costs may prevent such prospects from being economically viable. We will require various regulatory approvals in order to develop and produce from any of our discoveries, which may not be forthcoming or may be delayed.\nAdditionally, the analogies drawn by us from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields may not prove valid in respect of our drilling prospects. We may terminate our drilling program for a prospect if data, information, studies and previous reports indicate that the possible development of our prospect is not commercially viable and, therefore, does not merit further investment. If a significant number of our prospects do not prove to be successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nTo date, there has been limited exploration, appraisal and development drilling which has targeted the Inboard Lower Tertiary trend in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, an area in which we intend to focus a substantial amount of our exploration, appraisal and development efforts.\nOur discoveries and appraisal and development projects remain subject to varying degrees of additional evaluation, analysis and partner and regulatory approvals prior to official project sanction and production.\nOur use of the term \u201cdevelopment project\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our existing discoveries upon which we have conducted appraisal or development drilling. Our use of the term \u201cdiscoveries\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our existing discoveries and is not intended to refer to (i) our exploration portfolio as a whole, (ii) prospects where drilling activities have not discovered hydrocarbons or (iii) our undrilled exploration prospects. A discovery made by the initial exploration well on a prospect does not ensure that we will ultimately develop or produce hydrocarbons from such prospect or that a development project will be economically viable or successful. Following a discovery by an initial exploration well, substantial additional evaluation, analysis, expenditure of capital and partner and regulatory approvals will need to be performed and obtained prior to official project sanction and development, which may include (i) the drilling of appraisal wells, (ii) the evaluation and analysis of well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples and the results of production tests from both exploration and appraisal wells, and (iii) the preparation of a development plan which includes economic assumptions on future oil and gas prices, the costs of drilling development wells, and the construction or leasing of offshore production facilities and transportation infrastructure. Regulatory approvals are also required to proceed with certain development plans.\nAny of the foregoing steps of evaluation and analysis may render a particular development project uneconomic, and we may ultimately decide to abandon the project, despite the fact that the initial exploration well, or subsequent appraisal or development wells, discovered hydrocarbons. We may also decide to abandon a project based on forecasted oil and gas prices or the inability to obtain sufficient financing. We may not be successful in obtaining partner or regulatory approvals to develop a particular discovery, which could prevent us from proceeding with development and ultimately producing hydrocarbons from such discovery, even if we believe a development would be economically successful.\nOur proved reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserves estimates or assumptions underlying our reserves estimates could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their value. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise, and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation. Our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. In addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. The estimates of our proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:\n\u00b7\nhistorical production from an area compared with production from similar producing areas;\n\u00b7\nassumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and court rulings;\n\u00b7\nassumptions concerning future oil and natural-gas prices, future operating costs and capital expenditures; and\n\u00b7\nestimates of future severance and excise taxes, workover costs, and remedial costs.\nFor these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates. Additionally, because our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.\nWe are not, and may not be in the future, the operator of all our properties, and do not, and may not in the future, hold all of the working interests in our properties. Therefore, we will not be able to control the timing of exploration or development efforts, associated costs, or the rate of production of any non-operated and to an extent, any non-wholly owned, assets.\nWe are not the operator of our Heidelberg, Shenandoah and Anchor projects. The Heidelberg development project commenced production in January 2016 and is currently our only source of revenue. We are also not the operator on the Diaba Block offshore Gabon. As a non-operator of Heidelberg, Shenandoah and Anchor, we are subject to additional risks to our business and financial condition as the ultimate technical, operational and economic success of these projects will depend upon the efforts of our competitors. The long-term success of our business will depend in part upon whether Heidelberg, Shenandoah and Anchor are successful from a technical, operational and economic perspective, which we will have limited ability to control or influence as a non-operator.\nAs we carry out our exploration and development programs, we may enter into arrangements with respect to existing or future prospects that result in a greater proportion of our prospects being operated by others. In addition, the terms of our current or future licenses or leases may require at least the majority of working interests to approve certain actions. As a result, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of the prospects operated by our partners or which are not wholly-owned by us, as the case may be. Dependence on the operator or our partners could prevent us from realizing our target returns for those prospects. Further, it may be difficult for us to minimize the cycle time between discovery and initial production with respect to prospects for which we do not operate or wholly-own. The success and timing of exploration and development activities operated by our partners will depend on a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u00b7\npartner, government and regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\nselection of technology; and\n\u00b7\nthe rate of production of reserves, if any.\nThis limited ability to exercise control over the operations of some of our prospects may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDevelopment drilling may not result in commercially productive quantities of oil and gas reserves.\nOur exploration success has provided us with a number of major development projects on which we are moving forward. We must successfully execute our development projects, including development drilling, in order to generate future production and cash flow. However, development drilling is not always successful and the profitability of development projects may change over time.\nFor example, in new development projects available data may not allow us to completely know the extent of the reservoir or choose the best locations for drilling development wells. Therefore, a development well we drill may be a dry hole or result in noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Projects in frontier areas may require the development of special technology for development drilling or well completion and we may not have the knowledge or expertise in applying new technology. All costs of development drilling and other development activities are capitalized, even if the activities do not result in commercially productive quantities of hydrocarbon reserves. This puts a property at higher risk for future impairment if commodity prices decrease or operating or development costs increase.\nOur drilling and development plans are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter their occurrence or timing.\nOur drilling and development plans on our acreage are scheduled out over a multi-year period. Our drilling and development plans depend on a number of factors, including the availability of capital and equipment, qualified personnel, seasonal and weather conditions, regulatory and block partner approvals, civil and political conditions, oil prices, costs and drilling results. The final determination on whether to drill any exploration, appraisal, or development well, including the exact drilling location as well as the successful development of any discovery, will be dependent upon the factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as, to some degree, the results of our drilling activities. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the drilling locations we have identified or targeted will be drilled in the location we currently anticipate, within our expected timeframe or at all or if we will be able to economically produce oil or gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling and development plans and locations may be materially different from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDrilling wells is speculative, often involving significant costs that may be more than our estimates, and may not result in any discoveries or additions to our future production or reserves. Any material inaccuracies in drilling costs, estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect our business.\nExploring for and developing oil reserves involves a high degree of operational and financial risk, which precludes definitive statements as to the time required and costs involved in reaching certain objectives. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing and operating exploration, appraisal and development wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise due to a tightening in the supply of various types of oilfield equipment and related services. Drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including geological conditions, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Exploration wells\nbear a much greater risk of financial loss than development wells. In the past we have experienced unsuccessful drilling efforts. Moreover, the successful drilling of an oil well does not necessarily result in a profit on investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well or an entire development project to become uneconomic or only marginally economic. Our initial drilling sites, and any potential additional sites that may be developed, require significant additional exploration and appraisal, regulatory approval and commitments of resources prior to commercial development. We face additional risks in the Inboard Lower Tertiary Trend in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Gabon due to a general lack of infrastructure and, in the case of offshore Gabon, underdeveloped oil and gas industries and increased transportation expenses due to geographic remoteness. Thus, this may require either a single well to be exceptionally productive, or the existence of multiple successful wells, to allow for the development of a commercially viable field. If our actual drilling and development costs are significantly more than our estimated costs, we may not be able to continue our business operations as proposed and would be forced to modify our plan of operation.\nWe contract with third parties to conduct drilling and related services on our development projects and exploration prospects for us. Such third parties may not perform the services they provide us on schedule or within budget. The recent decline in oil and gas prices may have an adverse impact on certain third parties from which we contract drilling, development and related oilfield services, which in turn could affect such companies\u2019 ability to perform such services for us and result in delays to our exploration, appraisal and development activities. Furthermore, the drilling equipment, facilities and infrastructure owned and operated by the third parties we contract with is highly complex and subject to malfunction and breakdown. Any malfunctions or breakdowns may be outside our control and result in delays, which could be substantial. Any delays in our drilling campaign caused by equipment, facility or equipment malfunction or breakdown could materially increase our costs of drilling and cause an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe only recently began producing oil and gas and our future performance is uncertain.\nWe only recently began producing oil and gas from our Heidelberg project in which we own just a 9.375% working interest. We do not produce oil or gas from any of our other properties and do not expect to commence production from those properties for a significant amount of time. Production from our oil and gas properties will depend upon our ability to execute the appraisal and development of our projects and progress our projects through the project appraisal and development life-cycle, including the approval of development plans, obtaining formal project sanction, achieving successful appraisal and development drilling results and constructing or leasing production facilities and related subsea infrastructure. Our ability to commence production from our other properties will also depend upon us being able to obtain substantial additional capital funding on a timely basis and attract and retain adequate personnel. We have only been generating revenue from operations for a very short period of time and expect to generate only limited revenue from production for several years. Companies in their initial stages of development face substantial business and financial risks and may suffer significant losses. We have generated substantial net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since our inception and expect to continue to incur substantial net losses as we continue our project appraisal and development activities, our exploration drilling program and our new venture activities. We face challenges and uncertainties in financial and commercial planning as a result of the complex nature of our business and uncertainties regarding the nature, scope and results of our future activities and financial commitments. In the event that our appraisal, development or exploration drilling schedules are not completed, or are delayed, modified or terminated, our operating results will be adversely affected and our operations will differ materially from the activities described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result of industry factors or factors relating specifically to us, we may have to change our methods of conducting business, which may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe inability of one or more third parties who contract with us to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may be liable for certain costs if third parties who contract with us are unable to meet their commitments under such agreements. We are currently exposed to credit risk through joint interest receivables from our block and/or lease partners. As a result of our exploration success, we have a large inventory of development projects which will require significant capital expenditures and have long development cycle times. Our partners, both in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and West Africa, must be able to fund their share of investment costs through the lengthy development cycle, through cash flow from operations, external credit facilities, or other sources, including project financing arrangements. Our partners may not be successful in obtaining such financing, which could negatively impact the progress and timeline for development. In addition to project development costs, our partners must also be able to fund their share of exploration and other operating expenses. The significant decline in oil and gas prices over the past eighteen months may make it more difficult for our partners to meet their obligations to us under applicable joint operating and other agreements. For example, as of December 31, 2015, outstanding joint interest and other receivables attributable to our partners in West Africa were approximately $156.6 million. We may be unable to recover such outstanding amounts, which would materially negatively impact our liquidity and financial position. Furthermore, in response to the recent decline in oil and gas prices, certain of our partners have announced significant capital expenditure reductions, which may cause such partners to elect not to participate in the drilling of a particular exploration or appraisal well with us. This could dramatically increase our share of the costs of such operation and may cause us to cancel or delay certain operations and may materially adversely impact our liquidity and results of operations.\nIn addition, if any of the service providers we contract with to conduct development or exploration activities file for bankruptcy or are otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations to us, we may face increased costs and delays in locating replacement vendors. The recent severe decline in oil and natural gas prices and the resulting adverse impact on our industry may have an adverse impact on or contribute to the insolvency of certain third parties from which we contract drilling, development and related oilfield services, as well as block partners, which in turn could affect such companies\u2019 ability to perform such services for us and result in delays to our exploration, appraisal and development activities. The inability or failure of third parties we contract with to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are dependent on certain members of our management and technical team and our inability to retain or recruit qualified personnel may impair our ability to grow our business.\nOur investors must rely upon the ability, expertise, judgment and discretion of our management and the success of our technical team in identifying, discovering and developing oil reserves and progressing our development projects toward first production. Our performance and success are dependent, in part, upon key members of our management and technical team, and their loss or departure could be detrimental to our future success. You must be willing to rely to a significant extent on our management\u2019s discretion and judgment. In addition, a significant portion of our employee base is at or near retirement age. Furthermore, we utilize the services of a number of individual consultants for contractually fixed periods of time. Our inability to retain or recruit qualified personnel may impair our ability to grow our business and develop our discoveries, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nUnder the terms of our various license agreements, we are required to drill wells, declare any discoveries and conduct certain development activities in order to retain exploration and production rights and failure to do so may result in substantial license renewal costs or loss of our interests in these license areas.\nIn order to protect our exploration and production rights in our license areas, we must meet various drilling and declaration requirements. In general, unless we make and declare discoveries within certain time periods specified in our various license agreements and leases, our interests in the undeveloped parts of our license (as is the case in Angola and Gabon) or the whole block (as is the case in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico) areas may lapse and we may be subject to significant penalties or be required to make additional payments in order to maintain such licenses. For example, pursuant to the terms of the Block 9 RSA, the initial exploration period with respect to Block 9 offshore Angola will terminate on March 1, 2016 and, on such date we will lose our license on Block 9. Pursuant to the Block 21 RSA and Executive Decree No. 259/15, the initial exploration period on Block 21 expires on March 1, 2017. Under the Block 20 PSC, in order to preserve our rights in the block, we will be required to drill four exploration wells within five years of the signing of the Block 20 PSC, or January 1, 2017, subject to certain extensions. If the Angola Transaction is not ultimately consummated and we are unable to favorably renegotiate such license terms, we may be unable to meet such deadlines and may lose our exploration rights on Blocks 20 and 21.\nFurthermore, as required by our license agreements in Angola, within thirty days following a successful exploration well, we are required to submit a declaration of commercial well to Sonangol. Within two years after the date of the declaration of commercial well, we must submit to Sonangol a formal declaration of commercial discovery. Within three months from the declaration of commercial discovery, we are required to submit a development plan to Sonangol and the Angola Ministry of Petroleum for review and approval. Within forty-two months after the formal declaration of commercial discovery, we are required to commence first production from such discovery. Our failure or inability to meet these deadlines could jeopardize our production rights or result in forfeiture of our production rights with respect to these projects, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nIf the Angola Transaction is ultimately not consummated, certain drilling and declaration requirements will be very difficult to achieve with respect to our Cameia, Orca and Lontra discoveries and may require the need to renegotiate our various license agreements governing Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola with Sonangol. The deadline to file a declaration of commercial discovery with respect to our Lontra discovery was December 20, 2015. Given the pending Angola Transaction, we did not meet that deadline, although we requested an extension of this deadline from Sonangol and such extension was denied. Furthermore, Presidential Decree No. 212/15 was passed on December 2, 2015 which established a new Block 20/15 concession area covering our Lontra discovery. It is unclear what effect the passage of this Presidential Decree has on our rights under the Block 20 PSC with respect to our Lontra discovery. If the Angola Transaction is not ultimately consummated, Presidential Decree Laws may need to be passed in Angola, along with the renegotiation of our Block 20 PSC, in order to preserve our development rights with respect to Lontra. In light of (i) the apparent conflict between Presidential Decree No. 212/15 and our rights under the Block 20 PSC and (ii) the denial of our request for an extension of the declaration of commercial discovery deadline with respect to Lontra, we have elected to impair the value of our Lontra discovery included within current assets held for sale, as reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015.\nIn addition, most of our deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico blocks have a 10-year primary term, expiring between 2016 and 2025. Generally, we are required to commence exploration activities or successfully exploit our properties during the primary lease term in order for these leases to extend beyond the primary lease term. A portion of the leases covering our Shenandoah and Anchor discoveries are beyond their primary term, and the operator must conduct continuous operations or obtain a Suspension of Production in order to maintain such leases. The primary terms of certain leases covering our North Platte project are scheduled to expire in October 2016. If we fail to conduct continuous operations at North Platte following such date or we fail to obtain a Suspension of Production, such leases may terminate. In addition, certain of our targeted exploration prospects, including our Goodfellow prospect, have leases that expire within the next year and even if we were to commence exploration activities prior to lease expiration, we could be required to conduct continuous operations on those prospects if the initial exploration were to be successful. This requirement to conduct continuous drilling operations may cause us to relinquish such leases despite the fact that an exploration well on such leases was successful. Accordingly, we and our partners may not be able to drill all of the prospects identified on our leases or licenses prior to the expiration of their respective terms and we can make no assurances that we, or the operator of the discoveries in which we hold a non-operated interest, will be able to successfully perpetuate leases through continuous operations or obtaining a Suspension of Production. Should the prospects we have identified under the licenses or leases currently in place yield discoveries, we cannot assure you that we will not face delays in drilling these prospects or otherwise have to relinquish these prospects. The costs to maintain licenses over such areas may fluctuate and may increase significantly since the original term, and we may not be able to renew or extend such licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our actual drilling activities may therefore materially differ from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business. For each of our blocks and license areas, we cannot assure you that any renewals or extensions will be granted or whether any new agreements or leases will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or, in some cases, at all.\nWe are subject to numerous risks inherent to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas.\nOil and natural gas exploration and production activities involve many risks that a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Our future success will depend on the success of our exploration and production activities and on the future existence of the infrastructure and technology that will allow us to take advantage of our findings. Additionally, our properties are located in deepwater, which generally increases the capital and operating costs, technical challenges and risks associated with exploration and production activities. As a result, our exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of seismic data through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations.\nFurthermore, the marketability of expected production from our prospects will also be affected by numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, market fluctuations of oil and gas prices, proximity, capacity and availability of pipelines, the availability of processing facilities, equipment availability and government regulations (including, without limitation, regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of hydrocarbons, environmental, safety, health and climate change). The effect of these factors, individually or jointly, may result in us not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.\nWe are subject to drilling and other operational hazards.\nThe exploration and production business involves a variety of operating risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nblowouts, cratering and explosions;\n\u00b7\nmechanical and equipment problems;\n\u00b7\nuncontrolled flows or leaks of oil or well fluids, natural gas or other pollution;\n\u00b7\nfires and gas flaring operations;\n\u00b7\nmarine hazards with respect to offshore operations;\n\u00b7\nformations with abnormal pressures;\n\u00b7\npollution, other environmental risks and geological problems; and\n\u00b7\nweather conditions and natural disasters.\nThese risks are particularly acute in deepwater drilling and exploration for natural resources. Any of these events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental damage, impairment of our operations, delays in our drilling operations, increased costs and substantial losses. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. We do not carry business interruption insurance. The occurrence of any of these events, whether or not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nWe are members of several industry groups that provide general and specific oil spill and well containment resources in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore West Africa. Through these industry groups, as described under \u201cBusiness-Containment Resources\u201d, we have contractual rights to access certain oil spill and well containment resources. We can make no assurance that these resources will perform as designed or be able to fully contain or cap any oil spill, blow-out or uncontrolled flow of hydrocarbons. Furthermore, our contracts for the use of oil spill and well containment resources contain strict indemnity provisions that generally require us to indemnify the contractor for all losses incurred as a result of assisting us in our oil spill and well containment efforts, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. In the event we experience a subsea blowout, explosion, fire, uncontrolled flow of hydrocarbons or any of the other operational risks identified above, the oil spill and well containment resources which we have contractual rights to will not prevent us from incurring losses or shield us from liability, which could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nOur operations will involve special risks that could adversely affect operations.\nOffshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt our operations. As a result, we could incur substantial expenses that could reduce or eliminate capital and funds available for exploration, development or leasehold acquisitions, or result in loss of equipment and properties.\nDeepwater exploration generally involves greater operational and financial risks than onshore exploration or exploration in shallow waters. Deepwater drilling generally requires more time and more advanced drilling technologies, involving a higher risk of technological failure and usually higher drilling costs. Such risks are particularly applicable to our deepwater exploration efforts in the Inboard Lower Tertiary trend. In addition, there may be production risks of which we are currently unaware. Whether we use existing pipeline infrastructure, participate in the development of new subsea infrastructure or use floating production systems to transport oil from producing wells, if any, these operations may require substantial time for installation, or encounter mechanical difficulties and equipment failures that could result in significant cost overruns and delays. Furthermore, deepwater operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico generally lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result, a significant amount of time may elapse between a deepwater discovery and the marketing of the associated hydrocarbons, increasing both the financial and operational risk involved with these operations. Because of the lack and high cost of this infrastructure, oil and gas discoveries we make in the deepwater, if any, may never be economically producible.\nIn addition, in the event of a well control incident, containment and, potentially, cleanup activities for offshore drilling are costly. The resulting regulatory costs or penalties, and the results of third party lawsuits, as well as associated legal and support expenses, including costs to address negative publicity, could well exceed the actual costs of containment and cleanup. As a result, a well control incident could result in substantial liabilities for us, and have a significant negative impact on our earnings, cash flows, liquidity, financial position, and stock price.\nOur operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico may be adversely impacted by tropical storms and hurricanes.\nTropical storms, hurricanes and the threat of tropical storms and hurricanes often result in the shutdown of operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as well as operations within the path and the projected path of the tropical storms or hurricanes. In the future, during a shutdown period, we may be unable to access well sites and our services may be shut down. Additionally, tropical storms or hurricanes may cause evacuation of personnel and damage to offshore drilling rigs and other equipment, which may result in suspension of our operations. The shutdowns, related evacuations and damage can create unpredictability in activity and utilization rates, as well as delays and cost overruns, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nThe geographic concentration of our operations subjects us to an increased risk from factors specifically affecting those areas.\nOur operations are currently concentrated in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Until the consummation of the Angola Transaction, we will also maintain operations offshore Angola. In addition, we have an interest in the Diaba Block offshore Gabon. Some or all of these properties could be affected should such regions experience:\n\u00b7\nsevere weather or natural disasters;\n\u00b7\nmoratoria on drilling or permitting delays;\n\u00b7\ndelays in or the inability to obtain regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7\ndelays or decreases in production;\n\u00b7\ndelays or decreases in the availability of drilling rigs and related equipment, facilities, personnel or services;\n\u00b7\ndelays or decreases in the availability of capacity to transport, gather or process production; and/or\n\u00b7\nchanges in the regulatory, political and fiscal environment.\nFor example, in response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010, the U.S. government and its regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over oil and gas exploration, including the DOI, the BOEM and the BSEE, imposed moratoria on drilling operations, required operators to reapply for exploration plans and drilling permits and adopted extensive new regulations, which effectively had halted drilling operations in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico for a period of time. Additionally, oil and gas properties and facilities located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico were significantly damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, which required our competitors to spend a significant amount of time and capital on inspections, repairs, debris removal, and the drilling of replacement wells. We maintain insurance coverage for only a portion of these risks. There also may be certain risks covered by insurance where the policy does not reimburse us for all of the costs related to a loss. We do not carry business interruption insurance.\nDue to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties.\nWe are subject to regulatory risk in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and regulations enacted over the past several years may have significantly increased certain of the risks we face and increased the cost of operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nOn April 20, 2010, the Transocean Deepwater Horizon, a semi-submersible offshore drilling rig operating in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico under contract to BP plc exploded, burned for two days and sank, resulting in loss of life, injuries and a large oil spill. The U.S. government and its regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over oil and gas exploration, including the DOI, the BOEM and the BSEE, responded to this incident by imposing moratoria on drilling operations and adopting numerous new regulations and new interpretations of existing regulations regarding operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Compliance with these new regulations and interpretations has increased the cost of our drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nAssuming the Angola Transaction closes, our business will be almost entirely focused on the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The successful execution of our U.S. Gulf of Mexico business plan depends on our ability to continue our exploration and appraisal efforts. A prolonged suspension of or delay in our drilling operations would adversely affect our business, financial position or future results of operations.\nIn particular, in April 2015 the BSEE proposed new well control regulations, which include more stringent design requirements and operational procedures for critical well control equipment, including those aimed at improving equipment reliability, regulating drilling margin and preventing blowouts, as well as reforms in well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time well monitoring and subsea containment. Certain studies suggest that many wells drilled safely since 2010 could not be drilled as designed under the proposed regulations. If the rule were to be finalized as drafted, certain of our drilling operations may be delayed as required controls are implemented or may become infeasible or impossible due to the increased requirements.\nFurthermore, the Deepwater Horizon incident has increased and may further increase certain of the risks we face, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u00b7\nincreased governmental regulation and enforcement of our and our industry\u2019s operations in a number of areas, including health and safety, financial responsibility, environmental, licensing, taxation, equipment specifications and inspections and training requirements;\n\u00b7\nincreased difficulty in obtaining leases and permits to drill offshore wells, including as a result of any bans or moratoria placed on offshore drilling;\n\u00b7\npotential legal challenges to the issuance of permits and the conducting of our operations;\n\u00b7\nhigher drilling and operating costs;\n\u00b7\nhigher royalty rates and fees on leases acquired in the future;\n\u00b7\nhigher insurance costs, financial assurance requirements and increased potential liability thresholds under proposed legislation and regulations;\n\u00b7\ndecreased partner participation in wells we operate;\n\u00b7\nhigher capital costs as a result of any increase to the risks we or our industry face; and\n\u00b7\nless favorable investor perception of the risk-adjusted benefits of deepwater offshore drilling.\nThe occurrence of any of these factors, or their continuation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or future results of operations.\nWe face various risks associated with increased activism against oil and gas exploration and development activities.\nOpposition toward oil and gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the United States. Companies in the oil and gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, human rights, environmental matters, sustainability, and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain operations such as offshore drilling and development. For example, environmental activists have recently challenged lease sales, seismic acquisition activities and decisions to grant air-quality permits in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for offshore drilling.\nFuture activist efforts could result in the following:\n\u00b7\ndelay or denial of drilling permits;\n\u00b7\nshortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions or delays on our ability to obtain additional seismic data;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on installation or operation of gathering, processing or production facilities;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the use of certain operating practices;\n\u00b7\nlegal challenges or lawsuits;\n\u00b7\ndamaging publicity about us;\n\u00b7\nincreased regulation;\n\u00b7\nincreased costs of doing business;\n\u00b7\nreduction in demand for our products; and\n\u00b7\nother adverse effects on our ability to develop our properties.\nOur need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We do business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions in which we may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities. Thus, we face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or consultants, given that these parties may not always be subject to our control. Our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees and consultants may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.\nIn connection with entering into our RSAs for Blocks 9 and 21 offshore Angola, two Angolan-based E&P companies were assigned as part of the contractor group by the Angolan government. We had not worked with either of these companies in the past, and, therefore, our familiarity with these companies was limited. In the fall of 2010, we were made aware of allegations of a connection between senior Angolan government officials and one of these companies, Nazaki Oil and G\u00e1z, S.A. (\u201cNazaki\u201d), which was a full paying member of the contractor group but is no longer a member of such group. In March 2011, the SEC commenced an informal inquiry into these allegations. To avoid non-overlapping information requests, we voluntarily contacted the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) with respect to the SEC\u2019s informal request and offered to respond to any requests the DOJ may have. Since such time, we have complied with all requests from the SEC and DOJ with respect to their inquiry. In November 2011, a formal order of investigation was issued by the SEC related to our operations in Angola. In August 2014, we received a Wells Notice from the SEC related to this investigation. In January 2015, we received a termination letter from the SEC advising us that the SEC\u2019s FCPA investigation has concluded and the Staff does not intend to recommend any enforcement action by the SEC. This letter formally concluded the SEC\u2019s investigation. We continue to cooperate with the DOJ with regard to its ongoing parallel investigation. We have conducted an extensive investigation into these allegations and believe that our activities in Angola have complied with all laws, including the FCPA. We are unable to predict the outcome of the DOJ\u2019s ongoing investigation or any action that the DOJ may decide to pursue, or otherwise provide any assurance regarding the duration, scope, developments in, results of or consequences of its investigation.\nIn the future, we may be partnered with other companies with whom we are unfamiliar. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nA change in U.S. energy policy could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.\nU.S. energy policy and laws and regulations could change quickly, and substantial uncertainty exists about the nature of many potential rules and regulations that could impact the sources and uses of energy in the United States. For example, new CAFE standards enacted in 2012 have resulted in a significant increase in the fuel economy of cars and light trucks and have reduced the future demand for crude oil for road transport use. GHG emissions regulations may increase the demand for natural gas as fuel for power generation.\nWe design our exploration and development strategy and related capital investment programs years in advance. As a result, we are impacted in our ability to plan, invest and respond to potential changes in our business. This can result in a reduction of our cash flows and profitability to the extent we are unable to respond to sudden or significant changes in our operating environment due to changes in U.S. energy policy.\nOur need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a litigious environment.\nSome of the jurisdictions within which we operate have proven to be litigious environments. Oil and gas companies, such as us, can be involved in various legal proceedings, such as title, royalty, or contractual disputes, in the ordinary course of business.\nWe are currently, and from time to time we may become, involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. See \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d We are vigorously defending against the current lawsuits and do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, we cannot predict the occurrence or outcome of these proceedings with certainty, and if we are unsuccessful in these litigations and any loss exceeds our available insurance, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBecause we maintain a diversified portfolio of assets that includes both U.S. and international projects, the complexity and types of legal proceedings with which we may become involved may vary, and we could incur significant legal and support expenses in different jurisdictions. If we are not able to successfully defend ourselves, there could be a delay or even halt in our exploration, development or production activities or other business plans, resulting in a reduction in reserves, loss of production and reduced cash flows. Legal proceedings could result in a substantial liability and/or negative publicity about us and adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, legal proceedings distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by political and economic circumstances in the countries in which we operate.\nOur oil and gas exploration, development and production activities are subject to political and economic uncertainties (including but not limited to changes, sometimes frequent or marked, in energy policies or the personnel administering them), expropriation of property, cancellation or modification of contract rights, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies, unilateral renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities, redefinition of international boundaries or boundary disputes, foreign exchange restrictions, currency fluctuations, royalty and tax increases and other risks arising out of governmental sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, as well as risks of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, acts of terrorism, piracy, disease, guerrilla activities, insurrection and other political risks, including tension and confrontations among political parties. Some of these risks may be higher in the developing countries in which we conduct our activities, namely, Angola and Gabon.\nOur operations are exposed to risks of war, local economic conditions, political disruption, civil disturbance and governmental policies that may:\n\u00b7\ndisrupt our operations;\n\u00b7\nrestrict the movement of funds or limit repatriation of profits;\n\u00b7\nin the case of our non-U.S. operations, lead to U.S. government or international sanctions; and\n\u00b7\nlimit access to markets for periods of time.\nDisruptions may occur in the future, and losses caused by these disruptions may occur that will not be covered by insurance. Consequently, our exploration, development and production activities may be substantially affected by factors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute arising from non-U.S. operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts outside the U.S. or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the U.S., which could adversely affect the outcome of such dispute.\nOur operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the jurisdictions, including Angola, Gabon, the United States, the Cayman Islands and other jurisdictions, in which we do business, that affect foreign trade and taxation. Changes in any of these laws or policies or the implementation thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nThe oil and gas industry, including the acquisition of exploration acreage worldwide, is intensely competitive.\nThe international oil and gas industry is highly competitive in all aspects, including the exploration for, and the development of, new sources of oil and gas. We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring exploration acreage and hiring and retaining trained personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than us, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. These companies may be able to pay more for productive or prospective properties and prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our\nfinancial or personnel resources permit. Furthermore, these companies may also be better able to withstand the financial pressures of unsuccessful drill attempts, delays, sustained periods of volatility in financial markets and generally adverse global and industry-wide economic conditions, and may be better able to absorb the burdens resulting from changes in relevant laws and regulations, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional exploration prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for available capital for investment in the oil and gas industry. As a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to compete successfully in an intensely competitive industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nParticipants in the oil and gas industry are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nExploration and production activities in the oil and gas industry are subject to extensive local, state, federal and international regulations. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental regulations, particularly in respect of the following matters:\n\u00b7\nlicenses and leases for drilling operations;\n\u00b7\nforeign exchange and banking;\n\u00b7\nroyalty increases, including retroactive claims;\n\u00b7\ndrilling and development bonds and social payment obligations;\n\u00b7\nreports concerning operations;\n\u00b7\nthe spacing of wells;\n\u00b7\nunitization of oil accumulations;\n\u00b7\nenvironmental remediation or investigation; and\n\u00b7\ntaxation.\nUnder these and other laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage and other types of damages for which we may not maintain, or otherwise be protected by, insurance coverage. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws and regulations could change in ways that could substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the market price of our common stock.\nFor example, until the closing of the Angola Transaction and the cessation of our operations within Angola, we will be subject to the Foreign Exchange Law for the Petroleum Sector, which requires, among other things, that all foreign exchange operations be carried out through Angolan banks, that oil and gas exploration and production companies open local bank accounts in foreign currencies in order to pay local taxes and to pay for goods and services supplied by non-resident suppliers and service providers, and also that oil and gas exploration and production companies open local bank accounts in local currency in order to pay for goods and services supplied by resident suppliers and service providers. See \u201cBusiness-Laws and Regulations of Angola and Gabon-Angola\u201d for more information. These new rules require additional compliance efforts and costs on our and other industry participants\u2019 part, and may in some cases cause delay or other issues in connection with the acquisition of or payments for goods and services. As a result of the significant downturn in oil and gas prices and recent devaluation of the Angola kwanza versus the U.S. dollar, it has become more difficult to conduct foreign currency transactions in Angola. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult.\nWe periodically evaluate acquisitions of prospects and licenses, reserves and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. The successful acquisition of these assets requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nrecoverable reserves;\n\u00b7\nfuture oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials;\n\u00b7\ndevelopment and operating costs; and\n\u00b7\npotential environmental, safety, health and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject assets that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the assets to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental, safety, and health liabilities and could acquire assets on an \u201cas is\u201d basis. Significant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve other risks, including:\n\u00b7\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions;\n\u00b7\nthe challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of ours while carrying on our ongoing business;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations; and\n\u00b7\nthe challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nIf we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of a significant acquisition, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe success of a significant acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities from combining the acquired assets or operations with those of ours. Even if a combination is successful, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we may expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition or realize these benefits within the expected time frame. Anticipated benefits of an acquisition may be offset by operating losses relating to changes in commodity prices, increased interest expense associated with debt incurred or assumed in connection with the transaction, adverse changes in oil and gas industry conditions, or by risks and uncertainties relating to the exploration prospects of the combined assets or operations, or an increase in operating or other costs or other difficulties, including the assumption of environmental, safety and health or other liabilities in connection with the acquisition. If we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from an acquisition, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and to process and record financial and operating data.\nWe depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud application and services, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves and for many other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital\ntechnology. The complexity of the technologies needed to explore for and develop oil and gas in increasingly difficult physical environments, such as below-salt deepwater, and global competition for oil and gas resources make certain information more attractive to thieves.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites. For example, in 2012, a wave of network attacks impacted Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry and breached financial institutions in the US. Certain countries, including China, Russia and Iran, are believed to possess cyber warfare capabilities and are credited with attacks on American companies and government agencies.\nOur technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations. Although to date we have not experienced any cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that we will not be the target of cyber-attacks in the future or suffer such losses related to any cyber-incident. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nWe and our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety regulations which may result in material liabilities and costs.\nWe are, and our future operations will be, subject to various international, foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the emission and discharge of pollutants into the ground, air or water, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of regulated materials and the health and safety of our employees. We are required to obtain various environmental permits from governmental authorities for our operations, including drilling permits for our wells. There is a risk that we have not been or will not be at all times in complete compliance with these permits and the environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators, including through the revocation of our permits or the suspension or termination of our operations. If we fail to obtain permits in a timely manner or at all (due to opposition from community or environmental interest groups, governmental delays, changes in laws or the interpretation thereof or any other reasons), such failure could impede our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nWe, as the named lessee or as the designated operator under our current and future oil leases and licenses, could be held liable for all environmental, health and safety costs and liabilities arising out of our actions and omissions as well as those of our third-party contractors. To the extent we do not address these costs and liabilities or if we are otherwise in breach of our lease or license requirements, our leases or licenses could be suspended or terminated. We have contracted with and intend to continue to hire third parties to perform the majority of the drilling and other services related to our operations. There is a risk that we may contract with third parties with unsatisfactory environmental, health and safety records or that our contractors may be unwilling or unable to cover any losses associated with their acts and omissions. Accordingly, we could be held liable for all costs and liabilities arising out of the acts or omissions of our contractors, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs the designated operator of certain of our leases and licenses, we are required to maintain bonding or insurance coverage for certain risks relating to our operations, including environmental risks. We maintain insurance at levels that we believe are consistent with current industry practices, but we are not fully insured against all risks. Our insurance may not cover any or all environmental claims that might arise from our operations or those of our third-party contractors. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by our insurance, or our third-party contractors have not agreed to bear responsibility, such accident or event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to obtain required bonding or insurance coverage at all or in time to meet our anticipated startup schedule for each well, and if we fail to obtain this bonding or coverage, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nReleases to deepwater of regulated substances are common, and under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination caused by us or our contractors, at our facilities and at any third party waste disposal sites used by us or on our behalf. These costs could be material. In addition, offshore oil exploration and production involves various hazards, including human exposure to regulated substances, including naturally occurring radioactive materials. As such, we could be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to such substances or other damage resulting from the release of regulated substances to the environment, endangered species, property or to natural resources.\nParticularly since the Deepwater Horizon event in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in 2010, there has been an increased interest in making regulation of deepwater oil and gas exploration and production more stringent in the U.S. If adopted, certain proposals such as a significant increase or elimination of financial liability caps for economic damages, could significantly raise daily penalties for infractions and require significantly more comprehensive financial assurance requirements under OPA which could affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\nIn addition, we expect continued attention to climate change issues. Various countries and U.S. states and regions have agreed to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d), including methane (a primary component of natural gas) and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of oil and natural gas combustion. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has in the past and may in the future consider legislation requiring reductions in GHG emissions. The EPA began regulating GHG emissions from certain stationary sources in January 2011 and has enacted GHG emissions standards for certain classes of vehicles. The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions, including from certain offshore oil and natural gas production facilities on an annual basis. In addition, in accordance with the Obama Administration\u2019s June 2013 Climate Action Plan (\u201cCAP\u201d), the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan in August 2015, which sets forth binding guidelines for GHG emissions from existing power plants, as well as rules relating to GHG emissions from new, modified and reconstructed power plants. The EPA is also required pursuant to a settlement agreement to issue GHG emissions standards for oil refineries, but no such standards have been proposed to date. The CAP also calls upon EPA and other governmental agencies to identify ways in which to reduce methane emissions from various sectors, including the oil and gas industry. In addition, in August 2015 the EPA proposed new regulations to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas operations in an effort to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to forty-five percent by 2025. The EPA is also expected to expand the GHG Reporting Rule to cover all segments of the oil and gas industry. Additionally, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration administer GHG emissions standards for heavy, medium and light duty vehicles, which have become increasingly stringent over time. The regulation of GHGs and the physical impacts of climate change in the areas in which we, our customers and the end-users of our products operate could adversely impact our operations and the demand for our products.\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time. Our costs of complying with current and future environmental, health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from releases of, or exposure to, regulated substances may adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition. See \u201cBusiness-Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d\nNon-U.S. holders of our common stock, in certain situations, could be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock.\nOur assets consist primarily of interests in U.S. oil and gas properties (which constitute U.S. real property interests for purposes of determining whether we are a U.S. real property holding corporation) and interests in non-U.S. oil and gas properties, the relative values of which at any time may be uncertain and may fluctuate significantly over time. Therefore, we may be, now or at any time while a non-U.S. investor owns our common stock, a U.S. real property holding corporation. As a result, under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (\u201cFIRPTA\u201d), certain non-U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain from the disposition of shares of our common stock, in which case they would also be required to file U.S. tax returns with respect to such gain. Whether these FIRPTA provisions apply depends on the amount of our common stock that such non-U.S. investors hold and whether, at the time they dispose of their shares, our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market (such as the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d)) within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. So long as our common stock is listed on the NYSE, only a non-U.S. investor who has held, actually or constructively, more than 5% of our common stock may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the disposition of our common stock under FIRPTA.\nWe may incur substantial losses and become subject to liability claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.\nSeveral external factors could arise which would significantly impact our ability to effectively insure our oil and natural gas exploration and development operations. Should legislation be passed to increase the minimum insurance limit of the OSFR policy required for future U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas exploration, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain this insurance. The insurance markets may not provide products to financially insure us against all operational risks. For instance, civil and criminal penalties for environmental pollution can be very severe and may not be insurable. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the market price of available insurance is excessive or prohibitive relative to the risks presented. For instance, we do not purchase business interruption or wind insurance due to the market pricing.\nEven when insurance is purchased, exclusions in coverage, unanticipated circumstances and potentially large indemnity obligations may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. The continuation of the recent severe declines in oil and gas prices has had a negative impact on the foreign currency exchange market for the Angola Kwanza, which in turn has made it more difficult for our insurance provider in Angola to obtain foreign currency in an amount sufficient to procure adequate re-insurance. The inability of our insurance provider to obtain adequate re-insurance may jeopardize our insurance coverage or otherwise impair its ability to perform its obligations under our insurance policies and agreements. Because third-party contractors\nand other service providers are used in our offshore operations, we may not realize the intended protections of worker\u2019s compensation laws in dealing with their employees. Generally, under our contracts with drilling and other oilfield service contractors, we are obligated, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, to indemnify such contractors for all claims arising out of damage to our property, injury or death to our employees and pollution emanating from the well-bore, including pollution resulting from blow-outs and uncontrolled flows of hydrocarbons.\nIn addition, even when insurance is purchased, we may encounter disputes with our insurance providers concerning coverage and such providers may attempt to deny coverage. For example, certain of our insurance providers are disputing coverage for certain expenses and potential liabilities, including with respect to our current shareholder litigation matters. We are enforcing our rights to coverage pursuant to our insurance agreements with these insurance providers and believe such expenses and potential liabilities are covered by such insurance, within certain thresholds. Should we be unsuccessful in enforcing rights under our insurance agreements, should we breach the terms of our insurance agreements or should such insurance agreements not provide the coverage we believed to be in place, any losses we incur which are not covered wholly or partially by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be required to pay a material cash sum to Whitton Petroleum Services Limited (\u201cWhitton\u201d) in connection with the closing of the sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola.\nOn February 13, 2009, we entered into a restated overriding royalty agreement (the \u201cRoyalty Agreement\u201d) with Whitton. Pursuant to the terms of the Royalty Agreement, in consideration for Whitton's consulting services in connection with Blocks 9, 20 and 21 offshore Angola and our business and operations in Angola, Whitton is to receive quarterly payments (measured in U.S. Dollars) equal to 2.5% of the market price of our share of the crude oil produced in such quarter and not used in petroleum operations, less the cost recovery crude oil, assuming the applicable government contract is a production sharing agreement. If the applicable government contract is a risk services agreement and not a production sharing agreement (which is the case with respect to Blocks 9 and 21), pursuant to the Royalty Agreement, we have undertaken to agree with Whitton an economic model (the \u201cRSA Economic Model\u201d) containing terms equivalent to those in such risk services agreement and using actual production and costs. The RSA Economic Model has not yet been agreed with Whitton. If we assign all of our interests in such Blocks, Whitton may, depending on the option we elect, have the right to receive the market value of its rights and obligations under the Royalty Agreement, based upon the amount in cash a willing transferee of such rights and obligations would pay a willing transferor in an arm\u2019s length transaction. Given potential issues regarding how such market value of Whitton's rights and obligations under the Royalty Agreement could be calculated, including, without limitation, outstanding issues related to the RSA Economic Model, the amount of any such payment that could be owed to Whitton upon consummation of the sale of our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola is uncertain, but may be significant. Resolution of any such payment may include an expert determination of such cash value payment. We can make no assurance that any results from an expert determination process will be favorable to us. If we are ultimately required to pay a significant sum under the Royalty Agreement, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe conditional conversion feature of our 3.125% senior convertibles notes due 2024, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIf the conditional conversion feature of our 3.125% senior convertibles notes due 2024 is triggered, holders of such notes will be entitled to convert these notes at any time during specified periods outlined in the indenture governing such notes, at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of these notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nConversions of the notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nHolders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at their option at any time up until the maturity date, being December 1, 2019 for the 2.625% convertible senior notes due 2019 and May 15, 2024 for the 3.125% senior convertible notes due 2024. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.\nWe may account for the notes utilizing the treasury stock method. The effect of this method is that the shares issuable upon conversion of convertible securities are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such securities exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the notes would be accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued.\nHowever, we cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes, for whatever reason, then we would have to apply the if-converted method, the effect of which is that conversion will not be assumed for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share if the effect would be antidilutive. Under the if-converted method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, convertible debt is antidilutive whenever its interest, net of tax and nondiscretionary adjustments, per common share obtainable on conversion exceeds basic earnings per share. Dilutive securities that are issued during a period and dilutive convertible securities for which conversion options lapse, or for which related debt is extinguished during a period, will be included in the denominator of diluted earnings per share for the period that they were outstanding. Likewise, dilutive convertible securities converted during a period will be included in the denominator for the period prior to actual conversion. Moreover, interest charges applicable to the convertible debt will be added back to the numerator.\nThe borrowing base under our Heidelberg reserve-based loan facility will likely be substantially reduced in the near future, which could negatively impact our funding for future development drilling at Heidelberg.\nThe borrowing base under our Heidelberg reserve-based loan facility will likely be substantially reduced in the near future depending upon the level of oil and gas prices and the performance of the producing wells and production facilities associated with the Heidelberg field. The Heidelberg field started producing oil and gas in January 2016 and the performance of its producing wells is uncertain. The amount available for borrowing at any one time under the Heidelberg reserve-based loan facility is limited to a borrowing base amount determined twice a year using agreed projections by applying the lower of (i) a project life coverage ratio of 1.5:1.0 to the sum of discounted projected net revenues from the Heidelberg field and certain capital expenditures and (ii) a loan life coverage ratio of 1.3:1.0 to the sum of discounted projected net revenues from the Heidelberg field and certain capital expenditures. Interim borrowing base redeterminations can take place between scheduled redetermination dates in limited circumstances specified in the facility agreement.\nOur next redetermination will occur in March 2016 and our borrowing base will likely be substantially reduced. In the event the amount outstanding under our Heidelberg reserve-based loan facility at any time exceeds the borrowing base at such time, we may be required to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings. Currently, we have not borrowed any amounts under our Heidelberg reserve-based loan facility. If the borrowing base under our Heidelberg reserve-based loan facility is reduced, this could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition and could negatively impact funding for future development drilling at Heidelberg.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price may be volatile. The stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe timing or occurrence of the closing of the sale of our interests in Block 20 and 21 offshore Angola;\n\u00b7\nthe price of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe success of our development and production operations, and the marketing of any oil and gas we produce;\n\u00b7\nto what extent our exploration wells are successful;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries where we operate;\n\u00b7\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nquarterly or annual variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the industries in which we compete and issuance of new or changed securities;\n\u00b7\nincreases in operating costs, including cost overruns associated with our exploration and development activities;\n\u00b7\nanalysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u00b7\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u00b7\nthe issuance or sale of any additional securities of ours;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perception of our company and of the industry in which we compete and areas in which we operate; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, political and market conditions.\nA substantial portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market at any time. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nAll of the shares sold in our public offerings are freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the federal securities laws, unless purchased by our \u201caffiliates\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Substantially all the remaining shares of common stock are restricted securities as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may be sold in the U.S. public market only if registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration, including by reason of Rules 144 or 701 under the Securities Act. All of our restricted shares are eligible for sale in the public market, subject in certain circumstances to the volume, manner of sale limitations with respect to shares held by our affiliates, and other limitations under Rule 144. Additionally, we have registered all shares of our common stock that we may issue under our employee and director benefit plans. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, unless pursuant to their terms these stock awards have transfer restrictions attached to them. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nConversion of the notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who have previously converted their notes.\nThe conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our\ncommon stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nHolders of our common shares will be diluted if additional shares are issued.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, units and debt securities for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, repayment or refinancing of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions. We may issue additional shares of common stock in connection with complementary or strategic acquisitions of assets or businesses. We also issue restricted stock to our executive officers, employees and independent directors as part of their compensation. If we issue additional shares of common stock in the future, it may have a dilutive effect on our current outstanding stockholders.\nOwnership of our capital stock is concentrated among our largest stockholders and their affiliates.\nA small number of stockholders hold a majority of our common stock. These stockholders have influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and as a result, actions may be taken that you may not view as beneficial. Furthermore, these stockholders may sell their shares of common stock at any time. Such sales could be substantial and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter or prevent a change in control.\nSome provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as well as Delaware statutes, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control. These provisions, including those providing for the possible issuance of shares of our preferred stock and the right of the board of directors to amend the by-laws, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire a substantial number of shares of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in his or her best interest. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nProvisions of the notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.\nCertain provisions of the notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us, or may even prevent a third party from acquiring us. For example, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their notes or any portion of the principal amount of such notes in integral multiples of $1,000. In addition, the acquisition of us by a third party could require us, under certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such acquisition. By discouraging an acquisition of us by a third party, these provisions could have the effect of depriving the holders of our common stock of an opportunity to sell their common stock at a premium over prevailing market prices.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common shares and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our shares appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their shares of common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.", "PERMNO": 93152, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CIEIQ"}
