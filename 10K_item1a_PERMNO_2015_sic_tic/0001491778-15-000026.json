{"cik": "1491778", "company": "Angie's List, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following risks and the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d could materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and prospects. If that occurs, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have incurred annual net losses each year since inception, and we may continue to incur net losses as we invest to grow and penetrate our markets.\nWe have incurred annual net losses each year since inception. As a result, our accumulated deficit was $264.4 million as of December 31, 2014. Consequently, we have primarily funded our operations through equity and debt financings. Key elements of our growth strategy include growing our membership and service provider bases and penetration rates in each of the markets where we offer our services as well as enhancing consumer engagement in our marketplace. We anticipate that our expenses will continue to increase as we sustain our investments in growing our paid membership base, increasing the number and variety of participating service providers, developing new marketing initiatives, enhancing our technology platform and launching new products and services. In particular, we intend to continue to invest substantial resources in marketing to acquire new paid memberships and highlight our e-commerce offerings in an effort to increase the number of transactions in our marketplace. Further, we also plan to maintain our investments in our sales personnel and selling expenditures to grow our base of service providers participating in both advertising and e-commerce as well as in product and technology as we enhance our product offerings and technology platforms. These planned investments may result in additional net losses or negative cash flow impacts. We also expect to incur increased operating expenses as we hire additional personnel and invest in our infrastructure to support anticipated future growth and the reporting and compliance obligations to which we are subject as a public company. We have also expanded and expect to continue to grow the number of personnel in our sales force in an effort to increase revenue as the number of members has grown.\nIf our revenue does not grow or declines, or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations, we may not become profitable on a sustained basis. In addition, if our future growth and operating performance or our cash flows or losses resulting from our investments fail to meet investor or analyst expectations, our operating results, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, if our hiring of additional sales personnel does not result in a sufficient corresponding increase in revenue, the cost of the additional headcount will not be offset, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has historically demonstrated, and is likely to continue to exhibit, volatility, and could decline substantially within a short period of time. For example, since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in November 2011 at a price of $13.00 per share, our trading price has ranged from $4.36 to $28.32. The trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the risk factors discussed herein, these factors include:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares of our common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations relating to our business;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry, changes in securities analysts\u2019 projections or recommendations, withdrawal of research coverage or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022\nlarge volumes of sales of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that were often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies. Our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted due to declines or volatility in our stock price, and the value of an investment in our common stock could decrease as a result.\nSecurities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall stock market or in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. We are currently the subject of multiple stockholder class action lawsuits. These lawsuits, and any future stockholder class action lawsuits initiated against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and therefore harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe continue to make substantial investments in membership acquisition. If the revenue generated by new paid memberships varies significantly from our expectations, or if our membership acquisition costs or costs associated with servicing our members increase, we may not be able to recover our membership acquisition costs or generate profits from this investment.\nWe spent $87.4 million and $87.5 million on marketing expenditures in 2014 and 2013, respectively, much of which was for the intended purpose of acquiring new paid members, in addition to highlighting our e-commerce offerings and generating consumer traffic in our marketplace. We expect to continue to spend significant amounts to acquire additional paid members, primarily through national offline and online advertising, including an increasing emphasis on digital marketing platforms. Our decisions regarding investments in membership acquisition are based on our marginal marketing cost per paid membership acquisition and our analysis of the revenue we have historically generated per paid membership over the expected lifetime of such membership. Our analysis of the revenue that we expect new paid memberships to generate over their lifetimes depends on several estimates and assumptions, including membership renewal rates, future membership fees, e-commerce purchased by our members and incremental advertising and e-commerce revenue from service providers driven by increased penetration in a particular market. Our experience, estimates and assumptions in markets in which our penetration rates are presently lower may differ from our more established markets.\nOur average revenue per market and total revenue per paid membership in a geographic market have generally grown with the maturity and corresponding increased penetration of such markets in prior periods. In the future, we expect total revenue per paid membership to fluctuate from period to period, reflecting the timing of our ability to adjust advertising rates given our advertising contract terms and membership pricing and monetization strategies designed to drive increased penetration, among other factors. In addition, we continue to evaluate and adopt innovative pricing and packaging strategies, such as tiered pricing membership offerings, in an effort to deliver compelling value to our members and thereby support membership growth and retention, which has caused and may continue to cause membership revenue per paid membership and total revenue per paid membership to decline in some or all of our membership cohorts. In 2015, we are expecting membership revenue to decline in absolute dollars as compared to 2014 as a result of the impact associated with our introduction of tiered pricing membership plans on a national basis during the year, which reduced new membership fees, on average, across all markets and is putting downward pressure on our membership revenue and membership revenue per paid member.\nIf our estimates and assumptions regarding the revenue we can generate from new paid memberships prove incorrect, we may be unable to recover our membership acquisition costs or generate profits from our investment in acquiring new paid memberships. Moreover, if our membership acquisition costs or the costs associated with servicing our members increase, the return on our investment may be lower than we anticipate irrespective of the revenue generated by new memberships. If we cannot generate profits from this investment, our growth rate, business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on the strength of our brand, which is built on a foundation of authentic reviews and the trust of consumers, and the failure to maintain that authenticity and trust would damage our brand and harm our ability to maintain or expand our base of paid memberships and participating service providers.\nTrust in the integrity of the \u201cAngie\u2019s List\u201d brand and in the objective, unbiased nature of our ratings and reviews contributes significantly to our ability to attract new paid memberships and participating service providers. Maintaining consumer trust and enhancing our brand depends largely on our ability to maintain our commitment to and reputation for placing the interests of the consumer first. If our existing or potential members perceive that we are not focused on helping them make more informed purchasing decisions about local services transactions or that the revenue we receive from service providers interferes with the objective rating of service providers on the basis of member reviews, our reputation and the strength of our brand would be adversely affected. Complaints or negative publicity about our sales and business practices, products and services, personnel or customer service, irrespective of their validity, and data privacy and security issues could diminish consumers\u2019 confidence in our service and adversely impact our brand.\nTrust in our brand also will suffer if we are unable to maintain the quality and integrity of the ratings and reviews that appear on Angie\u2019s List. We collect reviews from both members and non-members (which do not factor into service provider ratings and are provided for informational purposes), and make these reviews available to members on our website and mobile application. While we utilize various technology-based algorithms and filters to detect fraudulent reviews, and we believe that our prohibition of anonymous reviews provides a degree of traceability and accountability not present in other websites, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of our reviews. Moreover, as our base of paid memberships expands and the number of service providers rated and reviewed by our members grows, we may see an increase in fraudulent or inaccurate reviews. If fraudulent or inaccurate reviews - positive or negative - increase on Angie\u2019s List, and we are unable to effectively identify and remove such reviews, the overall quality of our ratings and reviews would decrease, our reputation as a source of trusted ratings and reviews may be harmed and consumers and service providers may be deterred from using our products and services. We employ steps designed to ensure that consumer reviews are not inaccurate or fraudulent and that service providers are rated based solely on member reviews and not on the basis of any other factor, such as their advertising with us. If such steps prove ineffective or if members otherwise believe that we are not objective, we could lose their trust, and our brand, business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed as a result.\nIn addition, our brand could be harmed if others use any of our trademarks inappropriately. For example, service providers may use our trademarks without our permission, including our \u201cSuper Service Award,\u201d which is available only to service providers that maintain superior service ratings. We have in the past taken, and will in the future take, action, including initiating litigation, to protect our trademarks and the integrity of our brand. If such efforts are unsuccessful, our brand and our business could be adversely affected.\nThe covenants in the instruments that govern our current indebtedness may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe covenants in the instruments that govern our debt facility limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur debt and liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends;\n\u2022\nmake redemptions and repurchases of capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase debt, other than under our credit facility;\n\u2022\nengage in acquisitions, consolidations, asset dispositions, sale-leaseback transactions and affiliate transactions;\n\u2022\nchange our business;\n\u2022\namend our material agreements;\n\u2022\nissue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nrestrict distributions from subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\ngrant negative pledges to other creditors.\nThe debt facility also contains financial covenants that require us to achieve certain minimum levels of membership revenue and EBITDA and to maintain minimum levels of liquidity. The debt facility is secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and, through a delayed draw term loan facility, provides a source of liquidity to enable us to fund our current and future operations. A breach of any of the covenants or requirements in the debt facility could result in a default under the debt facility, unless we are able to obtain the necessary waivers or amendments. Our capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2014 exceeded the maximum allowable amount under the financial covenant set forth in the debt facility related to consolidated capital expenditures, and as such, we were not in compliance with this covenant at December 31, 2014. We remedied the noncompliance by obtaining a waiver of non-compliance under the financing agreement from the lender. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is not waived, and subject to any appropriate cure periods, the lenders could elect to exercise any of their available remedies, which may include the right to not lend any additional amounts to us or, in certain instances, to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay the borrowings with respect to the debt facility when due, the lender would be permitted to proceed against our collateral. If the lender takes any or all of these steps, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted, and we may be unable to continue to fund our operations.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our members\u2019 or service providers\u2019 data, our service may be perceived as not being secure, and members and service providers may curtail or terminate their use of our service.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our consumers, including both members and non-members, service providers and employees, in our data centers and networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Our service involves the storage and transmission of our members\u2019 and service providers\u2019 proprietary information, such as credit card and bank account numbers, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and liability. Our payment services may be susceptible to credit card and other fraud schemes, including unauthorized use of credit cards, debit cards or bank account information, identity theft or merchant fraud, and could result in fines by credit card companies or the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments.\nDespite a number of precautionary measures already in place, we are subject to a number of risks related to intentional business disruptions, cyber-attacks, data protection breaches, piracy and other security risks, and we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products and offerings and harm our reputation as a company. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to our members\u2019 or service providers' data, our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. As techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such events could adversely affect our competitive position, reputation, brand or future sales of our products, and our customers may assert claims against us related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could lose members and service providers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf security measures at third-parties are breached, our ability to automatically renew memberships and service provider commitments could be harmed.\nMany of our members and service providers shop at third-parties, including retailers such as Target and Home Depot, and pay by credit card at such places. While we assume third-parties adequately protect their customers\u2019 personal information, including bank account and credit card details, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to such personal information change frequently, and third-parties may be unable to implement sufficient preventive measures to protect that information. If any of our members\u2019 or service providers\u2019 bank account or credit card information is compromised by a security breach at a third-party, any such members or service providers may be forced to open a new bank account or obtain a new credit card, and the payment information we have on file for those impacted members and service providers would no longer be valid, impairing our ability to automatically renew the affected members\u2019 and service providers\u2019 accounts at the end of the applicable term. Our inability to automatically renew memberships and service provider commitments may have a significant negative impact on our revenue, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed as a result.\nInterruptions or delays in service arising from our third-party co-location technology facilities and cloud-based data service providers or our own systems could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nWe rely in part upon third-party co-location technology facilities and cloud-based data services vendors, including data center, Internet infrastructure and bandwidth, as well as payment processing vendors, to provide our products and services to our consumers and service providers. We do not control the operation of third-party facilities or vendors, and both our own facilities as well as the third-party facilities and vendors we use are vulnerable to damage or interruption from tornadoes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. These facilities and vendors are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, cyber-attacks, the failure of physical, administrative and technical security measures, terrorist acts, human error, financial insolvency of third-party providers or other unanticipated problems or events. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions in our service and unauthorized access to, or alteration of, the content and data contained on our systems or stored and delivered on our behalf by third-party vendors and facilities.\nOur technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our systems and our overall operations. Certain aspects of our technology infrastructure run on a complex distributed system, or what is commonly known as cloud computing. We own, operate and maintain the primary elements of this system, but some elements of this system are operated by third parties that we do not control and which would require significant time to replace, thereby increasing our vulnerability to problems\nwith the services they provide. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, interruptions and delays in service and availability for such elements. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with cloud computing technologies and information services could negatively impact our brand and reputation, our relationship with our consumers or our ability to attract, retain and serve our consumers and service providers.\nIn addition, we designed and developed key aspects of the software code and technical infrastructure for the technology platforms through which we provide our products and services, and we plan to continue to maintain and develop certain elements of our technology platforms internally. Our software code and technical infrastructure are complex, and such efforts may therefore lead to increased product and technology expense, operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products and services. These issues may not be identified immediately, which could result in further interruption, degradation or cost, thereby resulting in potential adverse impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our efforts to increase our number of paid memberships, retain existing paid memberships or maintain high levels of member engagement are not successful, our growth prospects and revenue will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to grow our business and generate both membership revenue and service provider revenue depends in part on attracting new paid members, retaining our existing paid membership base, maintaining high levels of consumer engagement and attracting consumers to utilize our e-commerce marketplace. It is important that we convince prospective members of the benefits of our service and existing members of its continuing value. In addition, it is also imperative that we elicit our members to submit reviews of service providers to our database. Driving membership revenue per paid membership entails increased penetration and active member engagement in each of our markets to both grow our database of reviews of service providers and enhance the value of our service to other members and prospective members. We also depend on growing our paid membership base as a means for increasing our service provider revenue via higher advertising rates and more active participation by service providers in our advertising and e-commerce initiatives. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in maintaining or expanding our paid membership base, or in increasing our revenue per paid membership.\nIn addition, we rely upon high membership renewal rates and \u201cword of mouth\u201d referrals from existing members to maintain and grow our paid membership base. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to maintain our renewal rates or continue receiving those referrals. Furthermore, although we use our number of paid memberships as one indicator of the growth of our business, some of our members may not actively utilize our service or submit reviews of service providers to our database. If member engagement does not meet our expectations, we may lose members or service providers who advertise with us, and our revenue may not increase or may decline.\nOur ability to increase the number of our paid memberships and to maintain high levels of member engagement will require us to continually address a number of challenges, and we may fail to do so successfully. Some of these challenges include:\n\u2022\ncontinuing to build our database of ratings and reviews of service providers;\n\u2022\nincreasing the number and variety of service providers reviewed by our members and non-members;\n\u2022\nconvincing consumers of the benefits of our service and making it easy for them to become paid members and purchase services;\n\u2022\nproviding membership plans that offer desirable benefits and levels of service at attractive price points;\n\u2022\ndelivering an optimal member experience, including relevant, high-quality discount coupons and other promotional offers from our participating service providers and compelling, easy-to-use e-commerce offerings; and\n\u2022\ncontinuing to innovate and keep pace with changes in technology and our competitors.\nOur inability to increase our number of paid memberships and to maintain high levels of member engagement would have an adverse impact on our growth prospects, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to effectively develop and sell additional products, services and features, including e-commerce and marketplace initiatives.\nWe invest in the development of new products, services and features with the expectation that we will be able to effectively offer them to consumers and service providers. For example, we continue to expand our marketplace initiatives, including enhancing the quality, availability and inventory of our e-commerce offers, and also introduced new tiered pricing membership plans with varying levels of service and benefits during the current year. Further, we also released a new and improved Angie's List mobile application, which incorporates our SnapFix functionality, and launched the Angie's List Weekly\ndigital magazine during 2014. We also continue to develop innovative products and services for qualified service providers. Moving forward, we plan to continue to invest in our marketplace efforts to sell new products, services and features. In addition, we may acquire vertical offerings that address additional \u201chigh cost of failure\u201d segments of the market for local services.\nWe are making substantial investments of time and resources in the development of our e-commerce marketplace strategy wherein we act as an intermediary in local service transactions. Acceptance of this business model by consumers and local service providers is not assured and may be affected by numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control. We are still experimenting with the design and pricing of offers in our e-commerce marketplace as well as new ways to monetize advertising and e-commerce opportunities with our service providers, and we may fail to provide offers that are desirable to consumers or advertising and e-commerce opportunities that are attractive to service providers. Further, if our competitors begin following a similar marketplace strategy, our prospects for success in this initiative may be adversely affected.\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to effectively sell new products, services and features as well as additional enhancements to our existing offerings. As our new product and service offerings evolve, we adapt our sales and marketing strategies accordingly, and changes in these strategies may delay or prevent growth in these parts of our business. For example, we continue to refine our service provider eligibility criteria, pricing and monetization strategies as well as our vendor credit and customer refund policies for our e-commerce offerings, which may cause our revenue from these offerings to fluctuate from period to period in the future. As many of our current and potential participating service providers have modest advertising budgets, there is no guarantee that the successful introduction of new products or services will not adversely affect sales of our current products and services or that those service providers that currently advertise or provide e-commerce offers with us will increase their aggregate spending as a result of the introduction of new products and services. If our efforts to effectively develop and sell additional products, services and features, including e-commerce and marketplace initiatives, are not successful, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer.\nAny failure to convince service providers of the benefits of advertising or providing e-commerce offerings on our platforms would harm our business.\nFor 2014 and 2013, we derived 77% and 73%, respectively, of our revenue from service providers, and we expect to continue to derive an increasing percentage of our revenue from service providers in the future. Our ability to attract, retain and deepen our relationships with service providers and, ultimately, to generate revenue depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing the number of paid memberships in our markets;\n\u2022\nmaintaining high levels of member and service provider engagement;\n\u2022\nenticing consumers to purchase e-commerce offerings;\n\u2022\ncompeting effectively for advertising dollars with other online and offline advertising providers; and\n\u2022\ncontinuing to develop and diversify our advertising and e-commerce offerings.\nWe offer both offline and online advertising products as well as an array of e-commerce opportunities to eligible service providers, and our business depends, in part, on service providers\u2019 willingness to engage in advertising and e-commerce. Service providers may view advertising or providing e-commerce offers with us as experimental, may choose not to advertise or engage in e-commerce with us or may leave us for competing alternatives upon expiration or termination of their agreements with us. Failure to demonstrate the value of our service would result in reduced spending by, or loss of, existing or potential future participating service providers, which could materially harm our business, revenue or financial condition.\nWe generally do not employ local \u201cfeet on the street\u201d sales forces to sell advertising and pitch e-commerce to service providers and instead rely on call center sales personnel. The resulting lack of a personal connection with service providers may impede us in growing service provider revenue. As we expand our business, it will be important for us to continue to recruit, integrate and retain additional skilled and experienced sales personnel who can effectively communicate our value proposition to service providers and increase the monetization of our membership base. Accordingly, we will be adversely affected if we hire poorly or if sales personnel do not reach desired levels of effectiveness within a period of time consistent with our historical experience as well as if we are unable to convince service providers to advertise or engage in e-commerce with us.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to increase our service provider revenue per paid membership as we increase our market penetration.\nHistorically, our service provider revenue per paid membership in a given market generally has increased concurrently with market penetration as we attracted more service providers, charged higher advertising rates and expanded our e-commerce initiatives in conjunction with the growth in the pool of members and non-members using our service. As we historically only increase advertising rates at the time of contract renewal, such rate increases in a given market may trail growth in market penetration. Moreover, trends in market penetration and growth in service provider revenue per paid membership in our larger markets have varied from our experiences in our smaller markets, and the same can be said with respect to comparisons between our more and less penetrated markets. Accordingly, growth of our membership bases or penetration of our markets may not result in service provider revenue increases until future periods, if at all. In addition, we are subject to risks associated with the credit quality of our service providers. If service providers to whom we provide advertising and e-commerce services are unable to meet their contractual obligations to us or we are generally unable to increase our service provider revenue per paid membership as we increase our market penetration, our service provider revenue could decrease, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nWe are involved in litigation matters that are expensive and time-consuming, and, if resolved adversely, such matters could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to claims and lawsuits incident to the ordinary course of business, such as a putative class action lawsuit brought by members and stockholder class action lawsuits, and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for such litigation in the future. Any negative outcomes from litigation that we are party to could result in payment of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products, services or business practices, and accordingly, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Although the results of litigation and claims brought against us cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of such matters that we currently face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, except as otherwise recorded within the consolidated financial statements. However, there can be no assurance of a favorable final outcome for all present and future legal matters, and regardless of the outcomes of present or future cases, any lawsuit can adversely impact our business due to the potential related defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal, potentially leading to payments of substantial damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Note 9, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWe are and will continue to be faced with many competitive challenges, any of which could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe compete for consumers, including both members and non-members, with traditional, offline consumer resources as well as with online providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals on the basis of a number of factors, including breadth of our service provider listings, reliability of our content, depth and timeliness of information, quality and availability of e-commerce offerings and strength and recognition of our brand. We also compete for a share of service providers\u2019 overall advertising budgets with traditional, offline media companies and other Internet marketing providers on the basis of a number of factors, including return on investment, our high-quality membership profile, effectiveness and relevance of our discount and e-commerce initiatives, our pricing and monetization strategies and recognition of our brand. Our current competitors include a number of traditional offline consumer resources, such as the Yellow Pages and Consumers\u2019 CHECKBOOK. Many of these competitors also provide consumer reviews and information about service providers online. We also compete with \u201cfree to consumer\u201d online ratings websites and referral services, such as Handy, Inc., HomeAdvisor, Inc., Houzz, Inc., Porch.com, Inc., Red Beacon, Inc., Thumbtack, Inc. and Yelp, Inc. In our Health categories, we compete for members with other online resources for patients, such as RateMDs, Inc. and Health Grades, Inc. Across all categories, we also compete with established Internet companies who possess significantly greater resources and name recognition than we do.\nTo compete effectively across our membership and service provider platforms, we must continue to invest significant resources in marketing and in the development of our products and services to enhance our value proposition to consumers as well as sustain our investments in our sales force, the development of existing and new advertising products and e-commerce offerings, the acquisition of new paid memberships and the collection of reviews of service providers. Failure to compete effectively against our current or future competitors could result in losses of current or potential participating service providers or a reduced share of our participating service providers\u2019 overall operating budgets, which could adversely affect our pricing and margins, lower our service provider revenue or prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability. There is no guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively in the future against existing or new competitors, and the failure to do so could result in losses of existing or potential paid memberships, reduced service provider revenue, increased marketing or selling expenses or diminished brand strength, any of which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to replicate our performance in our larger markets, our operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nOur penetration rates in a number of our larger geographic markets lag those in many of our mid-size markets. Several of our largest markets, including New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco, were converted to paid status beginning in 2006 and 2007, and these larger markets have produced the largest number of paid members to date. However, the penetration rates in these larger markets has generally lagged, on a percentage basis, those of our mid-size markets that converted to paid status in the same time frame. We believe that a principal reason for the lower penetration rates in our larger markets is the manner in which we market Angie\u2019s List. We spend the majority of our marketing dollars on national advertising, which we believe provides us the most cost-efficient manner of acquiring new paid members and highlighting our e-commerce offerings. However, advertising nationally means we deliver the same volume of advertising regardless of the size of market. We believe the same volume of advertising in a smaller market is more effective in building brand awareness and generating new memberships than in larger markets. Slower penetration of our larger markets may delay or prevent us from increasing total revenue per paid membership in these markets. If we are unable to replicate the performance we have achieved in our most mature markets in our larger and less penetrated markets, or if growth in larger or less penetrated markets is significantly slower than we anticipate, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant growth in new and existing markets, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Our growth strategy has required, and will continue to require, us to utilize substantial financial, operational and technical resources. Continued growth could strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our consumers and participating service providers, to effectively monetize our membership base, to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, to enhance our reporting systems and procedures and to recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel. As our operations continue to grow in size, scope and complexity, it will be important for us to continue to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure, and we may determine it is necessary to open additional operational locations, such as call centers, to support our advertising and e-commerce sales efforts, which would require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. If we fail to maintain the necessary level of discipline and efficiency, or if we fail to allocate limited resources effectively in our organization as it grows, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer.\nOur inability to implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives may adversely impact future results.\nOur ability to succeed in implementing our strategic plan and growth initiatives could require significant capital investment and management attention, which may result in the diversion of these resources from our core business and other business issues and opportunities. Additionally, any new initiative is subject to risks, including customer acceptance, competition, product differentiation, challenges to economies of scale in our marketplace, sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives to a point where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow. If we cannot successfully execute our strategic plan and growth initiatives, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur revenue and operating results have varied and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. Therefore, comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors discussed herein, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n\u2022\nour ability to retain our current paid memberships and build our paid membership base;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain our service providers that currently advertise and sell e-commerce with us and convince them to increase their advertising spending and e-commerce offers with us;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new service providers to advertise and provide e-commerce offerings;\n\u2022\nour ability to drive transaction volume in our marketplace;\n\u2022\nour revenue mix and any changes we make to our membership fees or other sources of revenue;\n\u2022\nour marketing costs or selling expenses;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u2022\nthe effects of increased competition in our business;\n\u2022\nour ability to keep pace with changes in technology and our competitors;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with defending any litigation or enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe impact of economic conditions in the United States on our revenue and expenses; and\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation affecting our business.\nFrom time to time, we change the compensation plans for our sales personnel. Any future changes to such compensation plans could disrupt our sales personnel, adversely affecting sales and reducing our revenue. We cannot guarantee that we will accurately forecast the impact of future changes to such compensation plans on our operating results.\nSeasonal variations in the behavior of our members and service providers also may cause fluctuations in our financial results. For example, we expect to experience some effects of seasonal trends in member and service provider behavior due to decreased demand for home improvement services in winter months. In addition, advertising expenditures by service providers tend to be discretionary in nature and may be sporadic, reflecting overall economic conditions, the economic prospects of specific service providers or industries, budgeting constraints, buying patterns and a variety of other factors, many of which are outside our control. We also expect revenue contributions from our e-commerce offerings to fluctuate from period to period as the offerings evolve and due to seasonality. While we believe seasonal trends have affected and will continue to affect our quarterly financial results, our growth trajectory may overshadow these effects from time to time. We believe that our business will continue to be subject to seasonality in the future, which may result in fluctuations in our financial results.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our future success depends in part upon the continued service of key members of our management team as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced sales, technical and other personnel. Our co-founders, William S. Oesterle and Angie Hicks, are critical to our overall management as well as the development of our culture and strategic direction. In particular, the reputation, popularity and talent of Ms. Hicks is an important factor in public perceptions of Angie\u2019s List, and the loss of her services or any repeated or sustained shifts in public perceptions of her could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, qualified individuals are in high demand in the Internet sector, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. Competition for these personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining them. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel possess more resources than us. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the technology sector, job candidates often consider the value of the stock compensation they would receive in connection with their employment. If we are unable to attract and retain our executive officers and key employees, we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives, and our business could be harmed.\nWe provide our executive officers and other key personnel with a mix of cash and equity compensation. With respect to equity compensation, we have only offered stock options to these parties to date. If options granted to executive officers and other key personnel lose value or are not in the money subsequent to the grant date, the viability of options as a retention tool could be negatively impacted, which may make it difficult to retain these employees. If we are unable to attract and retain executive officers and key personnel to our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed.\nWe may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If capital is not available to us, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be harmed.\nWe may require additional capital to operate or expand our business as certain of our strategic initiatives may necessitate substantial capital resources before they begin to generate revenue. Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. For example, our debt facility contains various restrictive covenants with respect to the use funds from our borrowings, and any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and pursue business opportunities. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Furthermore, volatility in the credit or equity markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt or equity financing or the cost of such financing may not be favorable. If sufficient funds are not available to enhance our solutions, maintain the competitiveness of our technology or pursue business opportunities, we may not be able to service our existing members, acquire new members or attract or retain participating service providers, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which could adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nEnsuring that we maintain adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be reevaluated frequently. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that need improvement.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company will be detected.\nAs we recognize membership revenue over the term of the membership and recognize service provider revenue ratably over the relevant contract period, downturns or upturns in membership or in service provider advertising may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe recognize membership revenue ratably over the term of a paid subscription and service provider revenue ratably over the time period during which the advertisements are run. As approximately 96% of our members subscribed on an annual or multi-year basis as of December 31, 2014, a large portion of our membership revenue reflects deferred revenue from memberships purchased in previous periods. Similarly, as our service provider contracts run for an average term of approximately one year, a large portion of our service provider revenue each period reflects purchasing decisions made in prior periods. Therefore, an increase or decrease in new or renewed memberships or new or renewed service provider contracts in any one period will not necessarily be fully reflected in our revenue for that period but will affect our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns or upturns in membership or advertising sales may not fully impact our results of operations until future periods.\nIf we fail to generate or maintain high-quality reviews and reports from our consumers, we may be unable to provide members with the information they seek, which could negatively impact membership retention and growth as well as service provider retention and growth.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to provide our members with the information they seek, which is directly impacted by the quality and quantity of reviews and reports provided by our member and non-member consumers. For example, we may be unable to offer our members adequate information on service providers if content is not contributed that is helpful or relevant to a service category in a particular market. We may be unable to provide members with the information they seek if consumers are unwilling to contribute reviews and reports due to concerns related to potential lawsuits or harassment by service providers they review, instances of which have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future. In addition, we may not be able to provide members with the information they seek if the information on our site is not updated.\nWe do not remove older reviews, and members may view these reviews as less relevant, helpful or reliable. If our site does not provide current information about service providers or members perceive reviews on our site as less relevant or stale, our brand, business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nMembership growth is impacted by traffic to our website from search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!, some of which offer products and services that compete directly with our services. If our website fails to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our site could decline, and our business could be adversely impacted.\nA portion of our website traffic is generated by non-paid search results that appear on search engines such as Google and Bing. While SEO has a much lower cost per acquisition as compared to many outbound marketing channels and has helped reduce our overall cost per membership acquisition, our ability to maintain high organic search rankings is not within our control. As such, our competitors\u2019 SEO efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours. Separately, Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that could adversely affect our search result rankings. For example, Google makes changes to its algorithm(s) from time to time, any one of which could potentially impact our rankings, which we are dependent upon to a certain extent to drive traffic and ultimately sales to our site. Our website has experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of Internet users directed to our website through search engines could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf service providers rated on our website do not meet the expectations of our members, or engage in unethical or illegal conduct, we may suffer reputational harm, liability or adverse impacts on our profitability and liquidity as a result.\nQuality and integrity are important foundations of our business that could be harmed by actions taken by service providers outside our control. Given that our members use our services to gather information about services that oftentimes carry a high risk of failure and also at times to purchase services at discounted rates through our e-commerce offerings, if such services are performed incompetently or if service providers fail to perform prepaid services, our reputation could be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that highly-rated service providers will perform to the satisfaction of our members or at all. In addition, unethical or illegal conduct by service providers rated on our website could damage our reputation or expose us to liability arising from claims made by or on behalf of those harmed by such conduct.\nWe pay service providers in advance for e-commerce offerings purchased by members. Under this payment model, service providers are paid regardless of whether the e-commerce offers are redeemed or the services are performed. Subject to certain limitations, our members may request a refund from us on their e-commerce transactions. As we do not have control over service providers and the quality of the services they deliver, we develop estimates for refund claims. Our actual level of refund claims could prove to be greater than the level of refund claims we estimate, particularly as our revenue from e-commerce offerings grows and we develop additional e-commerce products, services and features. Moreover, our members may make requests for refunds with respect to which we are unable to recover reimbursement from our service providers, particularly as we alter our service provider monetization strategies. An increase in our refund rates, or our inability to recover from our service providers, could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity.\nMany people utilize mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to access information about service providers and to search for and purchase e-commerce offers. If we are not successful in developing products through the use of these technologies, or our products are not widely adopted, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who seek information about service providers through mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, has increased significantly over the past several years and is likely to continue to grow in the future. If our members are unable to access our ratings and reviews of service providers on their mobile devices, if we otherwise fail to develop and maintain effective mobile advertising and e-commerce products and services or if our mobile products and services are not widely adopted by consumers, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer. Additionally, as new mobile devices and platforms are released, it is difficult to forecast the challenges that may arise, and we may need to devote significant resources to the development, support and maintenance of these products. Finally, if we experience problems with continued integration of our mobile application into mobile devices, if we experience issues with providers of mobile operating systems or mobile application download stores, such as Apple, Inc.'s App Store or Google Play, or if we face increased costs to distribute our mobile apps, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nFailure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and security of personal information, including personal health information, could result in liability to us, damage our reputation or harm our business.\nA variety of federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of personal information. We collect and utilize demographic and other information from and about consumers, including both members and non-members, as they interact with our various platforms. We may also collect information from consumers when they provide ratings and reviews of service providers, purchase e-commerce offers, participate in polls or contests or sign up to receive emails from us. Further, we utilize tracking technologies, including \u201ccookies,\u201d to help us manage and track consumers' interactions with our platforms and deliver relevant advertising. Claims or allegations that we violated laws and regulations related to privacy and data security could in the future result in negative publicity or a loss of confidence in us by consumers and service providers and may subject us to government fines. In addition, we have posted privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of consumer data on our websites and mobile application. Several Internet companies have incurred penalties for failing to abide by the representations made in their privacy policies and practices.\nIn the course of rating and reviewing health care or wellness providers, our consumers may post personal health information about themselves or others, and the health care or wellness providers reviewed by consumers may submit responses that contain private or confidential health information about those that left the reviews or others. While we strive to comply with applicable privacy and security laws and regulations regarding personal health information, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others or could cause us to lose consumers or service providers, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols for personal information, including personal health information, imposed by law, regulation, self-regulatory bodies, industry standards and contractual obligations. However, such laws and regulations are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations. Also, federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws or regulations regarding privacy matters. We are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation in the area of privacy of personal information could be enacted or its effect on our operations and business.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to accepting credit card and debit card payments.\nWe accept payments from consumers, including both members and non-members, primarily through credit and debit card transactions. For credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time. An increase in those fees could require us to either increase the prices we charge for our services, which could cause us to lose members and membership revenue, or suffer an increase in our operating expenses, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we or any of our processing vendors experience problems with our billing software, or if the billing software malfunctions, it could adversely affect our member satisfaction and could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment products. In addition, if our billing software fails to work properly and, as a result, we are unable to automatically charge our members\u2019 credit cards on a timely basis or at all, we could lose membership revenue, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, a security standard with which companies that collect, store or transmit certain data related to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders and credit and debit card transactions are required to comply. Our failure to comply fully with the PCI DSS may violate payment card association operating rules, federal and state laws and regulations and the terms of our contracts with payment processors and merchant banks. Such compliance failures may also subject us to fines, penalties, damages or civil liability and may result in the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments. In addition, there is no guarantee that PCI DSS compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft, loss or misuse of data pertaining to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders or credit and debit card transactions.\nIf we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures or significantly higher credit card costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain our chargeback rate at acceptable levels, our credit card fees for chargeback transactions or our fees for many or all categories of credit and debit card transactions, credit card companies and debit card issuers may increase our fees or terminate their relationship with us. Any increases in our credit card or debit card fees could adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if we elect not to raise the rates for our services to offset the increase. Meanwhile, the termination of our ability to process payments on any major credit or debit card would significantly impair our ability to operate our business and potentially negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs we develop and sell new products, services and features, we may be subject to additional and unexpected regulations, which could increase our costs or otherwise harm our business.\nAs we develop and sell products and services that address new segments of the market for local services and expand our marketplace initiatives, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations that could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs or restrict our operations. For example, our Angie\u2019s List Health offerings may become subject to complex federal and state health care laws and regulations, the application of which to specific products and services is unclear. Many existing health care laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the online health and wellness information and advertising products and services that we provide; nevertheless, they may be applied to our products and services.\nWe generate e-commerce offerings that enable consumers to purchase services or products from our service providers. Transactions between consumers and service providers through our platforms in connection with these offerings may be subject to regulation, in whole or in part, by federal, state and local authorities.\nIn addition, the application of certain laws and regulations to some of our promotions are uncertain. These include laws and regulations such as the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, or the CARD Act, and unclaimed and abandoned property laws. If these promotions are subject to the CARD Act or any similar state law or regulation, we may be required to record liabilities with respect to unredeemed promotions, and we may be subject to additional fines and penalties.\nFrom time to time, we may also be notified of additional laws and regulations that governmental organizations or others may claim should be applicable to our business. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or any failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity or cause us to alter our business practices, which could cause our revenue to decrease, our costs to increase or harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain, modify and scale the network infrastructure necessary to operate our website, mobile application and related technologies and platforms.\nOur members access reviews and other information through our website, mobile application and related technologies and platforms. Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain and serve our consumers, including both members and non-members, and service providers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our website and mobile application and the underlying network infrastructure. As our membership and service provider bases as well as the number of visitors to and level of activity on our website and various related platforms grow, the amount of information shared across our technology infrastructure will continue to grow, and we will therefore require an increasing amount of network capacity and computing power. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology platforms, including data centers, equipment and related network infrastructure as well as new technologies focused on driving enhanced customer experiences and business efficiencies, to support current and anticipated future growth and to effectively and efficiently handle the traffic and data flow on our website and systems. The development, expansion, operation and maintenance of our technology and network infrastructure is expensive and complex and requires significant internal and external resources. If we do not successfully develop, expand, operate or maintain our technology and network infrastructure, or if we experience operational failures, our reputation could be harmed, and we could lose current and potential consumers, including members and non-members, and participating service providers, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully prevent other companies, including copycat websites, from misappropriating our data in the future.\nFrom time to time, third parties attempt to misappropriate our ratings and reviews and other data pertaining to our service providers through website scraping, search robots or other means. We may not be able to successfully detect and prevent all such efforts in a timely manner or assure that no misuse of our data occurs.\nIn addition, third parties operating \u201ccopycat\u201d websites have attempted to misappropriate data from our network and to imitate our brand or the functionality of our website. When we identified such efforts by other companies, we employed technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt their operations. However, we may not be able to detect all such efforts in a timely manner, or at all, and even if we could, the technological and legal measures available to us may be insufficient to stop their operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of companies operating outside of the United States, our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the damage to our business caused by such websites. Regardless of whether or not we can successfully enforce our rights against the operation of these websites, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant time and financial, legal, operational or technological resources as well as significantly and adversely impact our brand, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual restrictions to safeguard our intellectual property. We do not have any patents or pending patent applications. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our digital content, aspects of our solutions for members and service providers, our technology, software, branding and functionality, or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Moreover, policing our proprietary rights is difficult and may not always be effective. Should we expand internationally in the future, we may need to enforce our rights under the laws of countries that do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we have 23 registered trademarks in the United States, including \u201cAngie\u2019s List,\u201d and two registered trademarks in Canada as well as two pending trademark applications in the United States. Some of our trade names may not be eligible to receive trademark protection. Trademark protection may also not be available, or sought by us, in every country in which our service may become available online. Competitors may adopt service names similar to ours or purchase our trademarks and utilize confusingly similar terms as keywords in Internet search engine advertising programs, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly confusing consumers and service providers. Moreover, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate marks similar to our trademarks. In addition, in the past, some service providers have used our trademarks inappropriately or without our permission, including our \u201cSuper Service Award,\u201d which is available only to service providers that maintain superior service ratings. We have in the past taken and may in the future take action, including initiating litigation, to protect our intellectual property rights and the integrity of our brand, but these efforts may prove costly, ineffective or both.\nWe currently hold the \u201cAngie\u2019s List\u201d Internet domain name and various other related domain names. Domain names generally are regulated by Internet governing bodies. If we lose the ability to use a domain name in the United States or any other country, we would be forced to incur significant additional expense to market our solutions, including the development of a new brand and the creation of new promotional materials, which could substantially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in foreign countries is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain the domain names that utilize the \u201cAngie\u2019s List\u201d name in all of the countries in which we currently intend to conduct business. Further, our digital content is not protected by any registered copyrights or other registered intellectual property and is instead protected by statutory and common law rights, user agreements that limit access to and use of our data and by technological measures. Compliance with use restrictions is difficult to monitor, and our proprietary rights in our digital content databases may be more difficult to enforce than other forms of intellectual property rights.\nLitigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our domain names and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could substantially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn order to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our personnel, consultants and third parties with whom we maintain relationships. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation of trade secrets or any unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and confidential information, and in such cases, we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection, or our competitors being able to obtain our trade secrets or independently develop similar or competing technologies, could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInternet, technology and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights. Some Internet, technology and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, any of which could be utilized to assert claims against us. Third parties may in the future assert that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights, and as we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. We cannot guarantee that we are not infringing or violating any third-party intellectual property rights.\nWe cannot predict whether assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or any infringement or misappropriation claims arising from such assertions will substantially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we are forced to defend against any infringement or misappropriation claims, whether they are with or without merit, are settled out of court or are decided in our favor, we may be required to expend significant time and financial resources on the defense of such claims. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party\u2019s patent or copyright rights, cease making, licensing or using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others, expend additional development resources to redesign our solutions, enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, content or materials and to indemnify our partners and other third parties. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required or desirable, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures. Litigation related to intellectual property rights, regardless of the outcome, could be expensive to resolve and could divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel. Any of these events could seriously harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSome of our services and technologies may utilize \u201copen source\u201d software, which may restrict how we use or distribute our services or require that we release the source code of certain services subject to those licenses.\nSome of our services and technologies may incorporate software licensed under so-called \u201copen source\u201d licenses, including, but not limited to, the GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License. These open source licenses typically require that source code subject to the licenses be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to open source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. These open source licenses typically mandate that proprietary software, when combined in specific ways with open source software, becomes subject to the open source license. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software.\nWe take steps to ensure that our proprietary software is not combined with, nor incorporates, open source software in ways that would require our proprietary software to be subject to an open source license. However, few courts have interpreted open source licenses, and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to some uncertainty. Additionally, we rely on multiple software programmers to design our proprietary technologies, and although we take steps to prevent our programmers from including open source software in the technologies and software code that they design, write and modify, we do not exercise complete control over the development efforts of our programmers, and we cannot be certain that our programmers have not incorporated open source software into our proprietary products and technologies or that they will not do so in the future. In the event that portions of our proprietary technology are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our services and technologies and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to provide software and related services necessary for the operation of our business.\nWe utilize third-party software in our product and service offerings and expect to continue to do so. The operation of our product and service offerings could be impaired if errors occur in the third-party software that we use. It may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third-party software as the development and maintenance of the software is not within our control. Accordingly, our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in third-party software. We cannot ensure that any third-party licensors will continue to make their software available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, invest the appropriate levels of resources in their software to maintain and enhance its capabilities or remain in business. Any impairment in our relationships with these third-party licensors could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, third-party in-licenses may expose us to increased risk, including risks associated with the assimilation of new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. The inability to obtain these licenses could result in delays in development of solutions until equivalent technology can be identified and integrated. Any such delays in services could cause our business, financial condition or results of operations to suffer.\nOur revenue may be negatively affected if we are required to pay sales tax or other transaction taxes on all or a portion of our past and future sales in jurisdictions where we are currently not collecting and reporting tax.\nWe currently only pay sales or other transaction taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we do business. We do not separately collect sales or other transaction taxes. A successful assertion by any state, local jurisdiction or country in which we do not pay such taxes that we should be paying sales or other transaction taxes on the sale of our products or services, or the imposition of new laws requiring the payment of sales or other transaction taxes on the sale of our products or services, could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past sales, create increased administrative burdens or costs, discourage consumers and service providers from purchasing products or services from us, decrease our ability to compete or otherwise substantially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may suffer liability as a result of the ratings or reviews posted on our website.\nOur terms of use specifically require members and non-members submitting reviews to represent that their ratings and reviews are based on their actual first-hand experiences and are accurate, truthful and complete in all respects and that they possess the right and authority to grant us a license to publish their reviews. However, we do not possess the ability to verify the accuracy of these representations on a case-by-case basis. There is a risk that a review may be considered defamatory or otherwise offensive, objectionable or illegal under applicable law. Therefore, there is a risk that publication of our ratings and reviews on our website may give rise to a suit against us for defamation, civil rights infringement, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, invasion of privacy, personal injury, product liability, breach of contract, unfair competition, discrimination, antitrust or other legal claims. From time to time, we are involved in claims and lawsuits based on the contents of the ratings and reviews posted on our website, including claims of defamation. To date, we have not suffered a material loss due to a claim of defamation. We may be subject to similar claims in the future, which could result in costly and time-consuming litigation, liability for money damages or injury to our reputation, thereby adversely impacting our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not realize the expected business benefits of our efforts to reorganize our sales force, and the reorganized sales department could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business or adversely affect our revenues and operating income.\nWe periodically make changes to the structure of our sales department in an effort to optimize performance and productivity, and we may make such changes again in the future. For example, in 2014, we reduced our sales force by 97 people. Such reorganizations involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the reorganization;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in and the cost of reorganizing operations, services and personnel;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue to offset reorganization costs;\n\u2022\nliabilities and expenses associated with the reorganization, both known and unknown; and\n\u2022\nnegative impacts on our operating income and revenues due to the reduction in productivity and efficiency caused by the reorganization process.\nIf we fail to properly evaluate and execute internal reorganizations, our business may be seriously harmed, negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations, and the value of your investment may decline as a result.\nWe face many risks associated with our long-term plan to expand our operations outside of the United States.\nExpanding our operations into international markets is an element of our long-term strategy. However, offering our products and services outside of the United States involves numerous risks and challenges. Most importantly, acquiring paid memberships in foreign countries and convincing foreign service providers to do business with us would require substantial investment by us in local advertising and marketing, and there can be no assurance that we would succeed or achieve any return on this investment. In addition, international expansion would expose us to other risks such as:\n\u2022\nthe need to modify our technology and sell our products and services in non-English speaking countries;\n\u2022\nthe need to localize our products and services to the preferences and customs of foreign consumers and service providers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing operations due to language barriers, distance, staffing, cultural differences and business infrastructure constraints;\n\u2022\nour lack of experience in marketing, and encouraging viral marketing, in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthe application of foreign laws and regulations to us, including more stringent consumer privacy and data protection laws;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe risk of member or service provider fraud;\n\u2022\nreduced or ineffective protection of our intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022\npotential adverse tax consequences associated with foreign operations and revenue.\nAs a result of these obstacles, we may find it impossible or prohibitively expensive to enter international markets, or entry into international markets could be delayed, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to expand our product and service offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, consumer and service provider demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies rather than through internal development. Our experience with respect to acquiring other businesses and technologies is limited. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses for identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. Furthermore, even if we successfully acquire additional businesses or technologies, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business or technology. In addition, we may unknowingly inherit liabilities from future acquisitions that arise after the acquisition and are not adequately covered by indemnities. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely impact our operating results. If an acquired business or technology fails to meet our expectations, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $128.3 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $158.9 million. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have experienced an ownership change in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to utilize our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or other pre-change tax attributes, to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income and taxes may be subject to limitations.\nFuture sales of our common stock by stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, holders and transferees of approximately 15,000,877 shares, or 26%, of our common stock, vested stock options and stock options that vest within 60 days possess rights, subject to certain conditions, that require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. In addition, in November 2011, March 2012, October 2013 and July 2014, we filed registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register an aggregate of 13,753,277 shares of our common stock for issuance through our amended and restated omnibus incentive plan. This plan also provides for automatic increases in the shares reserved for issuance under the plan. These shares may be sold in the public market upon issuance and, once vested, any restrictions are provided under the terms of the applicable plan or award agreement. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, cease coverage of our company or make projections that exceed our actual results, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might result in a decline to our stock price and trading volume.\nFurthermore, analysts publish their own projections for our actual results. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if we fail to meet securities and analysts\u2019 projections.\nConcentration of ownership among our officers and directors and their affiliates may limit the influence of new investors on corporate decisions.\nOur officers, directors and their affiliated funds beneficially own or control, directly or indirectly, approximately 27% of our company's outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, if some of these persons or entities act together, they would be capable of meaningfully influencing the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may delay or preclude an acquisition or cause the market price of our stock to decline. Some of these persons or entities may have interests different from the rest of our stockholders.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to replace a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of our Board of Directors, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our President or our Secretary, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our certificate of incorporation or bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend our bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent a hostile acquisition and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\nWe are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL. Under Section 203 of the DGCL, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or (i) our board of directors approves the transaction prior to the stockholder acquiring the 15% ownership position, (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder acquiring the 15% ownership position, the stockholder owns at least 85% of the outstanding voting stock (excluding shares owned by directors or officers and shares owned by certain employee stock plans) or (iii) the transaction is approved by the board of directors and by the stockholders at an annual or special meeting by a vote of 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock (excluding shares held or controlled by the interested stockholder). These provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our financing agreement restricts our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We anticipate that we will retain any future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate business operations purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to the parameters and restrictions set forth in any outstanding debt agreements at the time.", "PERMNO": 13106, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ANGI.1"}
