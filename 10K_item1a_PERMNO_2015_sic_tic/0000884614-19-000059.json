RISK FACTORS\nThere are many factors that may affect our business and results of operations. Additional discussion regarding factors that may affect our business and operating results is included elsewhere in this Report.\nOur business is seasonal and decreases in the demand for our energy products and services because of warmer-than-normal heating season weather or unfavorable weather conditions may adversely affect our results of operations.\nBecause many of our customers rely on our energy products and services to heat their homes and businesses, and for agricultural purposes such as crop drying, our results of operations are adversely affected by warmer-than-normal heating season weather. Weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our energy products and services for both heating and agricultural purposes. Accordingly, the volume of our energy products sold is at its highest during the peak heating season of October through March and is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather. For example, historically, approximately 60% to 70% of AmeriGas Propane\u2019s annual retail propane volume, 60% to 70% of UGI International\u2019s annual retail LPG volume, and 60% to 70% of Gas Utility\u2019s natural gas throughput (the total volume of gas sold to or transported for customers within our distribution system) has typically been sold during these months. Additionally, as a result of the AmeriGas Merger, we expect that an even greater portion of our earnings will be derived during the peak heating season of October through March. There can be no assurance that normal winter weather in our market areas will occur in the future.\nIn addition, our agricultural customers use LPG for purposes other than heating, including for crop drying, and unfavorable weather conditions, such as lack of precipitation, may impact the demand for LPG. Moreover, harsh weather conditions may at times impede the transportation and delivery of LPG, or restrict our ability to obtain LPG from suppliers. Spikes in demand caused by weather or other factors can stress the supply chain and limit our ability to obtain additional quantities of LPG. Changes in LPG supply costs are normally passed through to customers, but time lags (between when we purchase the LPG and when the customer purchases the LPG) may result in significant gross margin fluctuations that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur efforts to create operational benefits and cost efficiencies through business transformation initiatives at our business units may be disruptive and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may make adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, changes in strategy, acquisitions or other internal and external considerations. These adjustments may result in increased costs and temporarily reduced productivity, as well as a disruption in our ability to perform functions critical to our strategy. The effects of such adjustments could recur in connection with any current or future business transformation initiatives or we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of any such initiatives, or do so within the expected timeframe. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nWe are currently engaged in business transformation initiatives at our AmeriGas Propane and UGI International businesses designed to achieve operational benefits and cost efficiencies and to leverage technology to provide an enhanced customer experience. If we are unable to deliver the strategic and financial benefits that we anticipate, the achievement of these benefits is delayed, or the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources, then our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. Any failure to do so, which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation initiatives, unanticipated costs or charges, loss of key personnel and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. For further information on these initiatives, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Global LPG Business Transformation Initiatives.\u201d\nOur potential to increase revenues may be affected by the decline in retail volumes of LPG and our ability to retain and grow our customer base.\nThe retail LPG distribution industry in the U.S. and many of the European countries in which we operate is mature and has been declining over the past several years, with no or modest growth (or decline) in total demand foreseen in the next several years. Accordingly, we expect that year-to-year industry volumes will be principally affected by weather patterns. Therefore, our ability to grow within the LPG industry is dependent on our ability to acquire other retail distributors and to achieve internal growth, which includes expansion of the domestic ACE and National Accounts programs in the U.S. and expansion in Europe, as well as the success of our sales and marketing programs designed to attract and retain customers. A failure to retain and grow our customer base would have an adverse effect on our results. Acquisitions in the U.S. and Europe may require merger control filings with the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission, as applicable, and commitments or divestments of assets may be required to obtain clearance. Such commitments or divestments may influence the overall economics of the transaction.\nOur ability to grow our businesses will be adversely affected if we are not successful in making acquisitions or integrating the acquisitions we have completed.\nOne of our strategies is to grow through acquisitions in the U.S. and in international markets. We may choose to finance future acquisitions with debt, equity, cash or a combination of the three. We can give no assurances that we will find attractive acquisition candidates in the future, that we will be able to acquire such candidates on economically acceptable terms, that we will be able to finance acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, that any acquisitions will not be dilutive to earnings or that any additional debt incurred to finance an acquisition will not affect our ability to pay dividends. Moreover, acquisitions may require antitrust and other regulatory clearances. We may have to offer commitments (such as agreements not to compete for certain businesses) or divest assets to obtain clearance, which may adversely affect the overall economics of the transaction.\nTo the extent we are successful in making acquisitions, including the CMG Acquisition completed on August 1, 2019, such acquisitions involve a number of risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, the assumption of material liabilities, environmental liabilities, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations, difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees and difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices and internal controls, as well as in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations. Future acquisitions could also result in, among other things, the failure to identify material issues during due diligence, the risk of overpaying for assets, unanticipated capital expenditures, the failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, recording goodwill and other intangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges and fluctuations in quarterly results. There can also be no assurance that our past and future acquisitions will deliver the strategic, financial and operational benefits that we anticipate. The failure to successfully integrate the CMG Acquisition and other acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnergy efficiency and technology advances, as well as price induced customer conservation, may result in reduced demand for our energy products and services.\nThe trend toward increased conservation and technological advances, including installation of improved insulation and the development of more efficient furnaces and other heating devices, may reduce the demand for energy products. Prices for LPG and natural gas are subject to volatile fluctuations in response to changes in supply and other market conditions. During periods of high energy commodity costs, our prices generally increase, which may lead to customer conservation and attrition. A reduction in demand could lower our revenues and, therefore, lower our net income and adversely affect our cash flows. State and/or federal regulation may require mandatory conservation measures, which would reduce the demand for our energy products. Additionally, at the international level, EU and local laws and regulations may require mandatory conservation measures, which would reduce the demand for our energy products. The EU revised the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (\u201cEPBD\u201d) in 2018, with the goal to create a clear path towards a low and zero-emission and decarbonized building stock in the EU by 2050. EU countries have until March 2020 to adopt laws to implement the EPBD. The EU is also adopting further measures to decarbonize electricity generation in order to reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports and achieve its climate change objectives. Over time, these various measures will impact fossil fuel consumption in Europe. We cannot predict the materiality of the effect of future conservation measures or the effect that any technological advances in heating, conservation, energy generation or other devices might have on our operations.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by competition from other energy sources.\nOur energy products and services face competition from other energy sources, some of which are less costly for equivalent energy value. In addition, we cannot predict the effect that the development of alternative energy sources might have on our operations.\nOur LPG distribution businesses compete for customers against suppliers of electricity, fuel oil and natural gas. Electricity is a major competitor of LPG but, except in France, is generally more expensive than LPG on a Btu equivalent basis for space heating, water heating and cooking. However, in Europe and elsewhere, climate change policies favoring electricity from renewable energy sources may cause changes in current relative price relationships. Moreover, notwithstanding cost, the convenience and efficiency of electricity make it an attractive energy source for consumers and developers of new homes. In addition, due to the prevalence of nuclear electric generation in France, the cost of electricity is generally less expensive than that of LPG, particularly when the cost to install new equipment to convert to LPG is considered. Fuel oil is also a major competitor of LPG and, although a less environmentally attractive energy source, is currently less expensive than propane. Furnaces and appliances that burn LPG will not operate on fuel oil and vice versa, and, therefore, a conversion from one fuel to the other requires the installation of new equipment. Our customers generally have an incentive to switch to fuel oil only if fuel oil becomes significantly less expensive than LPG. Except for certain industrial and commercial applications, LPG is generally not competitive with natural gas in areas where natural gas pipelines already exist because natural gas is generally a significantly less expensive source of energy than LPG. The gradual expansion of natural gas distribution systems in our service areas has resulted, and may continue to result, in the availability of natural gas in some areas that previously depended upon LPG. As long as natural gas remains a less expensive energy source than LPG, our LPG business will lose customers in each region into which natural gas distribution systems are expanded.\nOur natural gas businesses compete primarily with electricity and fuel oil, and, to a lesser extent, with propane and coal. Competition among these fuels is primarily a function of their comparative price and the relative cost and efficiency of fuel utilization equipment. There can be no assurance that our natural gas revenues will not be adversely affected by this competition.\nIf we are unable to protect our information technology systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security resulting from cyber-security attacks or other events, or we encounter other unforeseen difficulties in the design, implementation or operation of our information technology systems, our operations could be disrupted, our business and reputation may suffer, and our internal controls could be adversely affected.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology systems, including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners, (iii) personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. In addition, we rely on our information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Despite our security measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, sabotage, or other disruptions. Similarly, our vendors or service providers could sustain the same risks and disruptions as described above. A loss of our information technology systems, or temporary interruptions in the operation of our information technology systems, or those of our vendors or service providers, or any other misappropriation of data, or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation. In addition, a cyber-security attack could provide a cyber-intruder with the ability to control or alter our pipeline operations. Such an act could result in critical pipeline failures.\nMoreover, the efficient execution of the Company\u2019s businesses is dependent upon the proper design, implementation and functioning of its current and future internal systems, such as the information technology systems that support the Company\u2019s underlying business processes. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems may result in disruptions of our operations. In addition, the effectiveness of our internal controls could be adversely affected if we encounter unforeseen problems with respect to the operation of our information technology systems. While we have purchased cyber-security insurance, there are no assurances that the coverage would be adequate in relation to any incurred losses.\nThe expansion, construction and development of our energy infrastructure assets subjects us to risks.\nWe seek to grow our business through the expansion, construction and development of our energy infrastructure, including new pipelines, such as PennEast, gathering systems, facilities and other assets. These projects are subject to state and federal regulatory oversight and require certain property rights, such as easements and rights-of-way from public and private owners, as well as regulatory approvals, including environmental and other permits and licenses. There is no assurance that we or our project partners, as applicable, will be able to obtain the necessary property rights, permits and licenses in a timely and cost-efficient manner or at\nall, which may result in a delay or failure to complete a project. We may face opposition to the expansion, construction or development of new or existing pipelines, gathering systems, facilities or other assets from environmental groups, landowners, local groups and other advocates. This opposition could take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt, or delay the development or operation of our assets and business. Failure to complete any pending or future infrastructure project may have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to successfully complete any pending or future infrastructure project, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. We may expand, construct or develop energy infrastructure to capture anticipated future growth in production and demand in an area in which anticipated growth and demand does not materialize. As a result, there is the risk that new and expanded energy infrastructure may not be able to attract enough customers to achieve our expected investment returns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur utility transmission and distribution systems, our non-utility midstream assets, and the assets of upstream interstate pipelines and other midstream providers may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur ability to manage operational risk with respect to utility distribution and transmission and non-utility midstream assets, and the availability of natural gas delivered by interstate natural gas pipelines and midstream gathering assets is critical to our financial results. We obtain our supply from local Marcellus Shale sources, as well as other trading points in the U.S. If we experience physical capacity constraints on one or more of the interstate or intrastate natural gas pipelines that supply our businesses, we may not be able to supply our customers, which could have an adverse impact on our financial results. Our businesses also face several risks, including the breakdown or failure of or damage to equipment or processes (especially due to severe weather or natural disasters), accidents and other factors, including as a result of overpressurization of or damage to natural gas pipelines. Operation of our transmission and distribution systems or our midstream assets below our expectations may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs, civil litigation and the risk of regulatory penalties.\nOur international operations could be subject to increased risks, which may negatively affect our business results.\nWe operate LPG distribution and energy marketing businesses in Europe through our subsidiaries and we continue to explore the expansion of our international businesses. As a result, we face risks in doing business abroad that we do not face domestically. Certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:\n\u2022\ncosts and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings, potential increases to corporate income taxes and the threat of \u201cdouble taxation\u201d;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which can affect demand for our products, increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and reported results;\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements, including European competition laws that may adversely affect the terms of contracts with customers, including with respect to exclusive supply rights, and stricter regulations applicable to the storage and handling of LPG;\n\u2022\neconomic and political uncertainty relating to the United Kingdom\u2019s vote to withdraw from the EU, commonly known as \u201cBrexit,\u201d and the ongoing negotiations to determine the terms of such withdrawal, which may result in, among other things, increased regulatory costs and challenges, greater volatility in the British pound sterling and euro, business disruptions and increased tariffs;\n\u2022\nnew and inconsistently enforced industry regulatory requirements, which can have an adverse effect on our competitive position;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual rights;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\nlocal political and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\npotential violations of federal regulatory requirements, including anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering law, economic sanctions, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and EU regulatory requirements, including the GDPR and Sapin II.\nIn particular, certain legal and regulatory risks are associated with international business operations. We are subject to various anti-corruption, economic sanctions and trade compliance laws, rules and regulations. For example, the U.S. government imposes restrictions and prohibitions on transactions in certain foreign countries, including restrictions directed at oil and gas activities in\nRussia. U.S. laws also prohibit the improper offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of money or anything of value to any foreign official or political party, or to any person, knowing that all or a portion of it will be used to influence a foreign official in his or her official duties or to secure an improper advantage. Ensuring compliance with all relevant laws, rules and regulations is a complex task. Violation of one or more of these laws, rules or regulations could lead to loss of import or export privileges, civil or criminal penalties for us or our employees, or potential reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on our principal LPG suppliers, which increases the risks from an interruption in supply and transportation.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, AmeriGas Propane purchased approximately 84% of its propane needs from 20 suppliers. If supplies from these sources were interrupted, the cost of procuring replacement supplies and transporting those supplies from alternative locations might be materially higher and, at least on a short-term basis, our earnings could be affected. Additionally, in certain geographic areas, a single supplier may provide more than 50% of AmeriGas Propane\u2019s propane requirements. Disruptions in supply in these geographic areas could also have an adverse impact on our earnings. Our international businesses are similarly dependent upon their LPG suppliers. For example, during Fiscal 2019, UGI International\u2019s business in the United Kingdom purchased approximately 88% of its LPG needs from two suppliers and, in Italy, approximately 50% of its supply was sourced from a single supplier. If supplies from UGI International\u2019s principal LPG sources are interrupted, the cost of procuring replacement supplies and transporting those supplies from alternative locations might be materially higher and our earnings could be adversely affected. There is no assurance that our international businesses will be able to continue to acquire sufficient supplies of LPG to meet demand at prices or within time periods that would allow them to remain competitive.\nOur ability to obtain sufficient quantities of LPG is dependent on transportation facilities and providers.\nSpikes in demand caused by weather or other factors can limit our access to port terminals and other transportation and storage facilities, disrupt transportation and limit our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of LPG. A significant increase in port and similar fees and fuel prices may also adversely affect our transportation costs and business. Transportation providers (rail and truck) in some circumstances have limited ability to provide additional resources in times of peak demand. Moreover, our transportation providers maintaining a staff of qualified truck drivers is critical to the success of our business. Regulatory requirements and an improvement in the economy could reduce the number of eligible drivers or require us to pay higher transportation fees as our transportation providers seek to pass on additional labor costs associated with attracting and retaining drivers.\nWe may not be able to collect on the accounts of our customers.\nWe depend on the viability of our customers for collections of accounts receivable and notes receivable. Moreover, our businesses serve numerous retail customers, and as we grow our businesses organically and through acquisitions, our retail customer base is expected to significantly expand. There can be no assurance that our customers will not experience financial difficulties in the future or that we will be able to collect all of our outstanding accounts receivable or notes receivable and any such nonpayment by our customers could adversely affect our business.\nOur profitability is subject to LPG pricing and inventory risk.\nThe retail LPG business is a \u201cmargin-based\u201d business in which gross profits are dependent upon the excess of the sales price over LPG supply costs. LPG is a commodity, and, as such, its unit price is subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply or other market conditions. We have no control over supplies, commodity prices or market conditions. Consequently, the unit price of the LPG that our subsidiaries and other distributors and marketers purchase can change rapidly over a short period of time. Most of our domestic LPG product supply contracts permit suppliers to charge posted prices at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major U.S. storage points such as Mont Belvieu, Texas or Conway, Kansas. Most of our international LPG supply contracts are based on internationally quoted market prices. We also purchase a portion of our supplies in the spot market. Because our subsidiaries\u2019 profitability is sensitive to changes in wholesale LPG supply costs, it will be adversely affected if we cannot pass on increases in the cost of LPG to our customers, or if there is a delay in passing on such cost increases. Due to competitive pricing in the industry, our subsidiaries may not fully be able to pass on product cost increases to our customers when product costs rise, or when our competitors do not raise their product prices in a timely manner. Finally, market volatility may cause our subsidiaries to sell LPG at less than the price at which they purchased it, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe offer our customers various fixed-price LPG programs, and a significant number of our customers utilize our fixed-price programs. In order to manage the price risk from offering these services, we utilize our physical inventory position, supplemented by forward commodity transactions with various third parties having terms and volumes substantially the same as our customer\u2019s contracts, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective. In periods of high LPG price volatility, the fixed-\nprice programs create exposure to over or under-supply positions as the demand from customers may significantly exceed or fall short of supply procured. In addition, if LPG prices decline significantly subsequent to customers signing up for a fixed-price program, there is a risk that customers will default on their commitments, adversely affecting our results of operations.\nChanges in commodity market prices may have a significant negative effect on our liquidity.\nDepending on the terms of our contracts with suppliers as well as our use of financial instruments to reduce volatility in the cost of LPG and natural gas, changes in the market price of LPG and natural gas can create margin payment obligations for us and expose us to increased liquidity risk. In addition, increased demand for domestically produced LPG and natural gas overseas may, depending on production volumes in the U.S., result in higher domestic LPG prices and expose us to additional liquidity risks.\nSupplier defaults may have a negative effect on our operating results.\nWhen we enter into fixed-price sales contracts with customers, we typically enter into fixed-price purchase contracts with suppliers. Depending on changes in the market prices of products compared to the prices secured in our contracts with suppliers of LPG, natural gas and electricity, a default of or force majeure by one or more of our suppliers under such contracts could cause us to purchase those commodities at higher prices, which would have a negative impact on our operating results.\nWe are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance.\nOur business operations are subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incidental to the handling, storage and distribution of combustible products, such as LPG, propane and natural gas, and the generation of electricity. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, and severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment arising from explosions and other catastrophic events, including acts of terrorism. As a result of these and other incidents, we are sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including regulatory investigations, claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. Additionally, environmental contamination could result in future legal proceedings. There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims or that such levels of insurance would be available in the future at economical prices. Moreover, defense and settlement costs may be substantial, even with respect to claims and investigations that have no merit. If we cannot resolve these matters favorably, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nThe risk of natural disasters and catastrophic events, including terrorism, may adversely affect the economy and the price and availability of LPG, other refined fuels and natural gas.\nNatural disasters and catastrophic events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, terrorist attacks, political unrest and other similar occurrences, may adversely impact the price and availability of LPG (including propane), other refined fuels and natural gas, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, our ability to raise capital and our future growth. The impact that the foregoing may have on our industries in general, and on us in particular, is not known at this time. A natural disaster or an act of terror could result in disruptions of crude oil or natural gas supplies and markets (the sources of LPG), cause price volatility in the cost of LPG, fuel oil and natural gas, and our infrastructure facilities could be direct or indirect targets. A natural disaster or terrorist activity may also hinder our ability to transport LPG and other refined fuels if our means of supply transportation, such as rail or pipeline, become damaged as a result of an attack. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth. Instability in the financial markets as a result of a natural disaster or terrorism could also affect our ability to raise capital. We have opted to purchase insurance coverage for natural disasters and terrorist acts within our property and casualty insurance programs, but we can give no assurance that our insurance coverage would be adequate to fully compensate us for any losses to our business or property resulting from natural disasters or terrorist acts.\nOur holding company structure could limit our ability to pay dividends or service debt.\nWe are a holding company whose material assets are the stock of our subsidiaries. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and to pay principal and accrued interest on our debt, if any, depends on the payment of dividends to us by our principal subsidiaries, AmeriGas, Inc., UGI Utilities, and Enterprises (including Energy Services and UGI International\u2019s subsidiaries in Europe, which may be subject to complexities regarding the repatriation of funds to the U.S.). Payments to us by those subsidiaries, in turn, depend upon their consolidated results of operations and cash flows. The operations of our subsidiaries are affected by conditions beyond our control, including weather, regulations, competition in national and international markets we serve, the costs and availability of propane, butane, natural gas, electricity, and other energy sources and capital market conditions. The ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us is also affected by the level of indebtedness of our subsidiaries, which is\nsubstantial, and the restrictions on payments to us imposed under the terms of such indebtedness.\nRegulators may not approve the rates we request and existing rates may be challenged, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn our UGI Utilities segment, our distribution operations are subject to regulation by the PAPUC. The PAPUC, among other things, approves the rates that UGI Utilities may charge its utility customers, thus impacting the returns that UGI Utilities may earn on the assets that are dedicated to its operations. We expect that UGI Utilities will periodically file requests with the PAPUC to increase base rates charged to customers. If UGI Utilities is required in a rate proceeding to reduce the rates it charges its utility customers, or is unable to obtain approval for timely rate increases from the PAPUC, particularly when necessary to cover increased costs, UGI Utilities\u2019 revenue growth will be limited and earnings may decrease.\nOur need to comply with, and respond to industry-wide changes resulting from, comprehensive, complex, and sometimes unpredictable governmental regulations, including regulatory initiatives aimed at increasing competition within our industry, may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nWhile we generally refer to our UGI Utilities segment as our \u201cregulated segment,\u201d there are many governmental regulations that have an impact on all of our businesses. Currently, we are subject to extensive and changing international, federal, state, and local safety, health, transportation, tax, and environmental laws and regulations governing the marketing, storage, distribution, and transportation of our energy products. Moreover, existing statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to the Company that may affect our businesses in ways that we cannot predict.\nNew regulations, or a change in the interpretation of existing regulations, could result in increased expenditures. In addition, for many of our operations, we are required to obtain permits from regulatory authorities and, in some cases, such regulatory permits could subject our operations to additional regulations and standards of conduct. Failure to obtain or comply with these permits or applicable regulations and standards of conduct could result in civil and criminal fines or the cessation of the operations in violation. Governmental regulations and policies in the U.S. and Europe may provide for subsidies or incentives to customers who use alternative fuels instead of carbon fuels. The EU has committed to cut CO2 emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and EU member states have implemented a range of subsidies and incentives to achieve the EU\u2019s climate change goals. These subsidies and incentives may result in reduced demand for our energy products and services.\nWe are investigating and remediating contamination at a number of present and former operating sites in the U.S., including former sites where we or our former subsidiaries operated manufactured gas plants. We have also received claims from third parties that allege that we are responsible for costs to clean up properties where we or our former subsidiaries operated a manufactured gas plant or conducted other operations. Most of the costs we incur to remediate sites outside of Pennsylvania cannot currently be recovered in PAPUC rate proceedings, and insurance may not cover all or even part of these costs. Our actual costs to clean up these sites may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nthe discovery of presently unknown conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in environmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\njudicial rejection of our legal defenses to third-party claims; or\n\u2022\nthe insolvency of other responsible parties at the sites at which we are involved.\nMoreover, if we discover additional contaminated sites, we could be required to incur material costs, which would reduce our net income.\nWe also may be unable to timely respond to changes within the energy and utility sectors that may result from regulatory initiatives to further increase competition within our industry. Such regulatory initiatives may create opportunities for additional competitors to grow their business or enter our markets and, as a result, we may be unable to maintain our revenues or continue to pursue our current business strategy.\nOur operations, financial results and cash flows may be adversely affected by existing and future global climate change laws and regulations, including with respect to GHG emission restrictions, as well as market responses thereto.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention in the U.S. and in foreign countries. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit GHG emissions. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon\ntaxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. Increased regulation of GHG emissions could impose significant additional costs on us, our suppliers, our vendors, and our customers.\nIn September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule establishing a system for mandatory reporting of GHG emissions. In November 2010, the EPA expanded the reach of its GHG reporting requirements to include the petroleum and natural gas industries, which include certain facilities of our natural gas distribution business. These subject facilities have been required to monitor emissions since January 2011 and to submit detailed annual reports beginning in March 2012. In addition, some states have adopted laws and regulations regulating the emission of GHGs for some industry sectors. Examples include (i) the California cap-and-trade program that requires certain covered entities, including propane companies, to purchase GHG emission allowances, and (ii) the Regional Northeast Gas Initiative, in which a number of states in the northeastern U.S. participate and have agreed to establish cap and trade programs to reduce power plant emissions.\nIn the EU, there is a commitment to cut CO2 emissions by at least 40% by 2030 and EU member states have implemented a range of subsidies and incentives to achieve the EU\u2019s climate change goals. Further, emissions are regulated via a number of means, including the European Union Emissions Trading System (\u2018\u2018EU ETS\u2019\u2019). The EU ETS is a trading system across the EU for industrial emissions. The EU ETS is expected to become progressively more stringent over time, including by reducing the number of allowances to emit GHGs.\nThe adoption and implementation of any U.S. federal, state or local laws or regulations or foreign laws or regulations imposing obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur significant costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for our energy products. The potential increase in our operating costs could include new costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our GHG emissions, pay taxes related to our GHG emissions, and/or administer and manage a GHG emissions program. We may not be able to pass on such increased costs to customers. In addition, changes in regulatory policies that result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products that are deemed to contribute to GHGs, or restrict their use, may reduce volumes available to us for processing, transportation, marketing and storage. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial results and cash flows.\nChanges in data privacy and data protection laws and regulations, particularly in Europe, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThere has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfers, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The law in these areas continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere could impact our processing of the personal information of our employees, vendors and customers. The EU adopted the GDPR, which became effective in May of 2018 and expanded EU data protections, in certain circumstances, to companies outside of the EU processing data of EU residents, regardless of whether the processing occurs in the EU. Similarly, the State of California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), effective January 1, 2020, which grants certain rights to California residents with respect to their personal information. We expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations and industry standards concerning data privacy and data protection in the U.S., the EU and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such laws, regulations, interpretations and standards may have on our business.\nThe GDPR requires companies to satisfy strict new requirements regarding the handling of personal information, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is processed to exercise a number of rights with respect to their personal information, such as correcting or requiring deletion of data about themselves. Supervisory authorities from different EU member states may interpret and apply the GDPR somewhat differently, and the GDPR also permits EU member states to create supplemental national laws, which increases the complexity of compliance. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, for serious breaches. The CCPA requires companies to make new disclosures to consumers about such companies\u2019 data collection, use, and sharing practices and inform consumers of their personal information rights such as deletion rights, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties, and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. The State of Nevada recently amended its online privacy law to allow consumers to submit requests to prevent websites and online service providers from selling personal information that is collected through a website or online service. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data as well as requiring disclosures about these practices.\nWhile we have invested significant time and resources in our GDPR compliance program, emerging and changing data privacy and data protection requirements, including CCPA, may cause us to incur additional substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. Any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or individuals. Moreover, any inquiries or investigations, any other government actions, or any actions by individuals,\nmay be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines, demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nThe provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), related regulations, and the rules adopted thereunder and other regulations, including the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (\u201cEMIR\u201d), may have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to hedge risks associated with our business.\nOur derivative hedging activities are subject to Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, which regulates the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and the federal banking regulators to implement the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s provisions through rulemaking, including rules regarding mandatory clearing, trade execution and margin requirements. We expect to qualify for and rely upon an exception from mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements for swaps entered into by commercial end-users to hedge commercial risks. In addition to relief from the clearing mandate, we also expect to qualify for an exception for non-financial end-users from the margin requirements on uncleared swaps. If we are not able to do so and have to post margin as to our uncleared swaps in the future, our costs of entering into and maintaining swaps would be increased.\nWhile most of the CFTC\u2019s rules and regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized, some additional rules and regulations have yet to be adopted. It is possible that additional rules and regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act (including position limits as described below) may increase our cost of using derivative instruments to hedge risks associated with our business or may reduce the availability of such instruments to protect against risks we encounter. While costs imposed directly on us due to regulatory requirements for derivatives under the Dodd-Frank Act, such as reporting, recordkeeping and electing the end-user exception from mandatory clearing, are relatively minor, costs imposed upon our counterparties may increase the cost of our doing business in the derivatives markets to the extent such costs are passed on to us.\nIf we become subject to position limits, our ability to hedge risks would be further limited and we would be subject to additional compliance and reporting obligations. The CFTC has re-proposed position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents, although certain bona fide hedging transactions would be exempt from these position limits. The CFTC has also finalized a rule that requires market participants to aggregate their positions with those of certain other persons under common ownership or control for purposes of determining compliance with applicable position limits. If adopted, the revised position limit rule and its finalized companion rule on aggregation may adversely impact our ability to hedge exposure to price fluctuation of certain commodities. In addition to the CFTC federal position limit regime, designated contract markets also have established position limits and accountability regimes. We may have to modify trading decisions or liquidate positions to avoid exceeding such limits or at the direction of the relevant exchange to comply with accountability levels. Further, any such position limit regime, whether imposed at the federal level or by a designated contract market, may impose added operating costs to monitor compliance with such position limit levels, addressing accountability level concerns and maintaining appropriate exemptions, if applicable.\nEMIR may result in increased costs for over-the-counter derivative counterparties trading in the EU and may also lead to an increase in the costs of, and demand for, the liquid collateral that EMIR requires central counterparties to accept. Although we expect to qualify as a non-financial counterparty under EMIR, and thus not be required to post margin under EMIR, we may still be subject to increased regulatory requirements, including recordkeeping, marking to market, timely confirmations, derivatives reporting, portfolio reconciliation and dispute resolution procedures. Regulations under EMIR could significantly increase the cost of derivatives contracts, materially alter the terms of derivatives contracts and reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter. The increased trading costs and collateral costs may have an adverse impact on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nAccordingly, our business and operating results may be adversely affected if we are forced to reduce or modify our current use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder as a result of EMIR.\nVolatility in credit and capital markets may restrict our ability to grow, increase the likelihood of defaults by our customers and counterparties and adversely affect our operating results.\nVolatility in credit and capital markets may create additional risks to our businesses in the future. We are exposed to financial market risk (including refinancing risk) resulting from, among other things, changes in interest rates and conditions in the credit and capital markets. Developments in the credit markets during the past few years increase our possible exposure to the liquidity, default and credit risks of our suppliers and vendors, counterparties associated with derivative financial instruments and our customers. Although we believe that current financial market conditions, if they were to continue for the foreseeable future, will not have a significant impact on our ability to fund our existing operations, less favorable market conditions could restrict our\nability to grow through acquisitions, limit the scope of major capital projects if access to credit and capital markets is limited, or adversely affect our operating results.\nWe depend on our intellectual property and failure to protect that intellectual property could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe seek trademark protection for our brands in each of our businesses, and we invest significant resources in developing our business brands. Failure to maintain our trademarks and brands could adversely affect our customer-facing businesses and our operational results.\nDeclines in the stock market and a low interest rate environment may negatively impact our pension liability.\nDeclines in the stock market and a low interest rate environment have had a significant impact on our pension liability and funded status. Declines in the stock or bond market and valuation of stocks or bonds, combined with low interest rates, could further impact our pension liability and funded status and increase the amount of required contributions to our pension plans.", "PERMNO": 17929, "SIC": 4932, "TIC": "UGI"}
