RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, growth prospects and the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Strategy\nWe have incurred significant losses to date and anticipate continuing to incur losses in the future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception in June 2006, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $283.5 million and $265.6 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $20.2 million and $30.9 million, respectively. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability, and we may not be able to achieve profitability in the near future or at all, which may depress our stock price.\nThrough December 31, 2018, we have derived substantially all of our revenues from sales of Regalia, Grandevo and Venerate. In addition, we have derived revenues from strategic collaboration and development agreements for the achievement of testing validation, regulatory progress and commercialization events, and from sales of other products. Accordingly, there is only a limited basis upon which to evaluate our business and prospects. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to market and sell other products, such as Zequanox, Majestene/Zelto, Haven, and Stargus/Amplitude as well as our ability to increase sales of Regalia, Grandevo and Venerate and introduce new products. An investor in our stock should consider the challenges, expenses and difficulties we will face as a company seeking to develop and manufacture new types of products in a relatively established market. We expect to derive future revenues primarily from sales of our crop protection and plant health products, but we cannot guarantee the magnitude of such sales, if any. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand our research and development activities, further increase manufacturing capabilities and expand our sales and marketing activities for the further commercialization of our crop protection and plant health products and other product candidates. We expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next several years, and may never become profitable.\nThere is uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur historical operating results as of December 31, 2018 indicate substantial doubt exists related to our ability to continue as a going concern for the 12 months from the issuance of the accompanying financial statements. However, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $19.8 million at December 31, 2018, together with expected revenues, net proceeds from expected future debt or equity financings, and continued cost management will be sufficient to fund operations as currently planned for at least one year from the date of the issuance of the accompanying financial statements. However, we cannot predict, with certainty, the outcome of actions to grow revenues, obtain financing and/or manage or reduce costs. We have based this belief on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be wrong, and we could spend our available financial resources less or more rapidly than currently expected. We may continue to require additional sources of cash for general corporate purposes, which may include operating expenses, working capital to improve and promote our commercially available products, advance product candidates, expand international presence and commercialization, general capital expenditures and satisfaction of debt obligations. Management may seek additional capital through debt financings, collaborative or other funding arrangements with partners, or through other sources of financing. Should we seek additional financing from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. The actions discussed above cannot be considered probable of occurring and mitigating the substantial doubt raised by our historical operating results and satisfying our estimated liquidity needs for 12 months from the issuance of the accompanying financial statements. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment in our common stock.\nWe expect to require additional financing in the future to meet our business requirements and to service our debt. Such capital raising may be costly, difficult or not possible to obtain and, if obtained, could significantly dilute current stockholders\u2019 equity interests, and we may be unable to repay our secured indebtedness.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant losses until we are able to significantly increase our revenue. Accordingly, we expect to need significant additional financing to maintain and expand our business, including, for example, costs associated with increased headcount, potential capital expenditures to grow capacity at our Bangor manufacturing facility and potential acquisitions of complementary technologies, as well as to meet the financial covenants of and pay the principal and interest under our debt agreements, under which approximately $21.4 million of principal and deferred interest payments remained outstanding as of March 18, 2019. We intend to seek additional funds from public or private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic collaborations involving up-front cash payments or other means. Additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Any additional equity financing may be significantly dilutive to stockholders or, in some cases, require us to seek stockholder approval for the financing, and debt financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants and bear high rates of interest. In addition, our existing loan agreements contain certain restrictive covenants that either limit our ability to or require a mandatory prepayment if we incur additional indebtedness and liens and enter into various specified transactions. We therefore may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions unless we obtain the consent of our lenders or prepay the outstanding amounts under the debt agreements, which could require us to pay additional prepayment penalties. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We also may be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as warrants, which may adversely impact our financial results.\nCertain of our debt agreements also contain financial covenants, including maintaining minimum current, debt-to-worth and loan-to-value ratios and provisions providing for an event of default if there is a material adverse change in our financial condition or if we are in default under certain of our other agreements. We are not in compliance with certain of these covenants and have received waivers from our lenders, none whom have previously declared an event of default on our indebtedness. Breach of covenants included in our debt agreements, which could result in the lenders demanding payment of the unpaid principal and interest balances. If we fail to pay any principal or interest under our indebtedness when due, or are otherwise in violation of certain covenants under our debt agreements, this may result in the acceleration of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect upon our business and would likely require us to seek to renegotiate these debt arrangements with the lenders, as we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness.\nIf we cannot raise more money when needed, or are unable to use our future working capital, borrowings or equity financing to repay or refinance the amounts outstanding under our debt agreements or to renegotiate our debt arrangements with lenders, we may have to reduce our capital expenditures, scale-back our development of new products, reduce our workforce or license to others products that we otherwise would seek to commercialize ourselves. Any of these eventualities would likely have a material adverse impact on our value and the value of our equity.\nOur business may fail if we are not able to increase sales.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to significantly increase sales from the bio-based pest management products we have commercialized, both domestically and abroad. Our initial sales of our primary formulation of Regalia and our initial formulation of Grandevo occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2011, respectively. We began selling Zequanox in the second half of 2012, Venerate in May 2014, Majestene in December 2015, Haven in March 2017 and Stargus/Amplitude in December 2017. However, while we have invested considerable resources in the launch of our products, various factors have impeded higher growth in sales of these products.\nFor example, we believe adverse conditions in the U.S. agricultural industry, including low commodity prices, may have reduced demand for our products. Further delays in regulatory approvals of certain of our products in Europe and other jurisdictions may slow international growth, and any delay in a product launch that causes us to miss a growing season may require us to wait a year to enter that market. The extended drought in California and other markets reduced demand for our products as fewer acres are planted, changes in weather patterns in Florida resulted in a shortened bloom cycle for the citrus market and few pesticide and plant health products being used, and certain of our strategic collaborations have not resulted in significant increases in sales of Regalia in row crops and outside of the Unites States. Due to our strategic plan, we have not committed sufficient resources to Zequanox in order to market it full-scale, and our collaboration efforts with regard to this product may not result in increased sales. In addition, the departures of our former chief operating officer and significant members of our sales staff in the third quarter of 2014 and subsequent turnover in our sales and marketing department disrupted the 2014 launch of Venerate as well as growth in sales of our other commercialized products, including Regalia and Grandevo. Further, we believe that following the announcement of the matters relating to our 2015 financial restatement, some customers and potential customers were concerned about our reported investigation efforts, and therefore, were reluctant to do business with us until after we had reached a settlement with the SEC.\nLower than expected sales growth may result in an increase in write-offs and inventory obsolescence if we are not be able to use raw materials or sell finished goods before they expire, and may result in higher proportional operating expense levels, increases in our cost of product revenues and decreases in product margins as we are unable to manufacture products as efficiently at low volumes and underutilization of our Bangor, Michigan manufacturing facility results in increased relative overhead and operating costs in addition to decreased allocation of depreciation and other costs to production and inventory. If we are unable to establish a successful sales and marketing infrastructure internally and increase sales of our commercialized products, our financial results will be adversely affected, our available cash and ability to raise additional capital will decrease and our business may fail.\nWe have limited experience in marketing and selling our products and will need to continue expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure.\nWe currently have limited sales and marketing experience and capabilities. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 21 full-time equivalent sales and marketing personnel, 6 of whom focus on technical support and demonstration and conducting field trials and 7 of which focus on marketing. The majority of these sales personnel were hired following the departures in the third quarter of 2014, including our former chief operating officer, who led our sales and marketing teams, and significant members of our sales staff. In addition, we believe that prior to the financing transactions we completed in the first half of 2018, concerns and rumors about our ability to continue operations led to some turnover of our sales and marketing team, which we believe impacted our sales during that quarter and could impact our sales in the near-term. New personnel require significant training to attain a high level of technical expertise and knowledge regarding the capabilities of our bio-based products compared with conventional chemical pest management products and techniques in order to educate growers and independent distributors on the uses and benefits of our products. We will need to further develop our sales and marketing capabilities and find partners in order to successfully increase sales of our commercially available products and to commercialize other products we are developing, which may involve substantial costs. There can be no assurance that our field development specialists and other members of our sales and marketing team will successfully compete against the sales and marketing teams of our current and future competitors, many of which may have more established relationships with distributors and growers. Our inability to recruit, train and retain sales and marketing personnel, or their inability to effectively market and sell the products we are developing, could impair our ability to gain market acceptance of our products and cause our sales to suffer.\nIf we are unable to maintain and further establish successful relations with the third-party distributors that are our principal customers, or they do not focus adequate resources on selling our products or are unsuccessful in selling them to end users, sales of our products will be adversely affected.\nIn the United States, we rely on independent distributors of agrichemicals to distribute and assist us with the marketing and sale of Regalia, Grandevo, Venerate, Majestene/Zelto, Haven, Stargus/Amplitude and other products we are developing. We also are leveraging these relationships to sell Jet-Ag in most U.S. regions. These distributors are our principal customers, and revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in establishing and maintaining this sales and distribution channel. However, there can be no assurance that our distributors will be successful in selling our products to end users, or will focus adequate resources on selling them, and they may not continue to purchase or market our products for a number of reasons.\nFor example, many distributors lack experience in marketing bio-based pest management and plant health products, which generally must be used differently than conventional chemical pesticides. Distributors may not continue to market our products if they receive negative feedback from end users and key influencers (pest control advisors and university researchers), or if we believe our products are being blamed for damage to treated plants caused by other pesticides with which our products have been combined (whether properly or improperly). In addition, many of our distributors are in the business of distributing and manufacturing other, possibly competing, pest management and plant health products, including internally developed and commercialized bio-based products as well as bio-based products developed by larger agrichemical companies that negotiate to \u201cbundle\u201d such specialty products with other high demand products. For example, a portion of our sales of Venerate are tied to Albaugh\u2019s promotion, sales and services related to products under its BIOST platform, in addition to the effectiveness of their proprietary blend, which while containing Venerate, is developed by Albaugh and not by us. To the extent our distributors are unsuccessful in selling our products to end users, or in marketing their own products that incorporate our products, they may purchase lower volumes from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our distributors may earn higher margins by selling competing products or combinations of competing products. If we are unable to establish or maintain successful relationships with independent distributors, we need to further develop our own sales and demand creation capabilities, which would be expensive and time-consuming, and the success of which would be uncertain.\nWe depend on a limited number of distributors.\nOur current revenues are derived from a limited number of key customers, each of which serves as a third-party distributor to our products\u2019 end users. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our top two distributors accounted for 52% and 33% of our total revenues, respectively. We expect a limited number of distributors to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future. This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results. The loss or reduction of business from one or a combination of our significant distributors could materially adversely affect our revenues, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe product candidates we select for development and commercialization may fail to generate significant revenues, and we may not be able to successfully enter into strategic collaborations with respect to our other product candidates.\nOur internal development efforts are limited to two product candidates: MBI-014, a bioherbicide that is based on the same microorganism in Venerate and Majestene/Zelto, which we submitted to the EPA in August 2018; and MBI-601, a biopesticide that produces gaseous natural compounds that functions as a \u201cbiofumigant,\u201d which received EPA approval in November 2016. We are now focusing on the MBI-014 submission and reducing the manufacturing cost of MBI-601. Simultaneously, we are seeking collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize early stage candidates on which we have elected not to expend significant internal resources.\nSuccessful development of product candidates will require significant additional investment, including costs associated with research and development, completing field trials and obtaining regulatory approval, as well as the ability to manufacture our products in large quantities at acceptable costs while also preserving high product quality. Difficulties often encountered in scaling up production include problems involving production yields, quality control and assurance, shortage of qualified personnel, production costs and process controls. In addition, we are subject to inherent risks associated with new products and technologies. These risks include the possibility that any product candidate may:\n\u25cf be found unsafe;\n\u25cf be harmful to consumers, growers, farm workers or the environment;\n\u25cf be harmful to crops when used in connection with conventional chemical pesticides;\n\u25cf cause a major crop failure;\n\u25cf be ineffective or less effective than anticipated;\n\u25cf be displaced by new technologies;\n\u25cf fail to receive or take longer to receive necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf be difficult to competitively price relative to alternative pest management solutions;\n\u25cf be difficult or impossible to manufacture on an economically viable scale;\n\u25cf be subject to supply chain constraints for raw materials;\n\u25cf fail to be developed and accepted by the market prior to the successful marketing of similar products by competitors;\n\u25cf be impossible to market because it infringes on the proprietary rights of third parties; or\n\u25cf be too expensive for commercial use.\nOur decisions regarding which product candidates to pursue may cause us to fail to capitalize on product candidates that could have given rise to viable commercial products and profitable market opportunities. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into new arrangements with third parties, on favorable terms or at all, with respect to product candidates we do not pursue internally.\nIf our ongoing or future field trials are unsuccessful, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval of, or commercialize, our products on a timely basis.\nThe successful completion of multiple field trials in domestic and foreign locations on various crops and water infrastructures is critical to the success of our product development and marketing efforts. If our ongoing or future field trials are unsuccessful or produce inconsistent results or unanticipated adverse side effects on crops or on non-target organisms, or if we are unable to collect reliable data, regulatory approval of our products could be delayed, or we may be unable to commercialize our products. In addition, more than one growing or treatment season may be required to collect sufficient data and we may need to collect data from different geographies to prove performance for customer adoption. Although we have conducted successful field trials on a broad range of crops, we cannot be certain that additional field trials conducted on a greater number of acres, or on crops for which we have not yet conducted field trials, will be successful. Moreover, the results of our ongoing and future field trials are subject to a number of conditions beyond our control, including weather-related events such as drought or floods, severe heat or frost, hail, tornadoes and hurricanes, or low or no natural occurrence of the pests intended for testing. Generally, we pay third parties, such as growers, consultants and universities, to conduct field tests on our behalf. Incompatible crop treatment practices or misapplication of our products by these third parties or lack of sufficient occurrence of the identified pests in nature for a particular trial could impair the success of our field trials.\nOur inability to obtain regulatory approvals, or to comply with ongoing and changing regulatory requirements, could delay or prevent sales of the products we are developing and commercializing.\nThe field testing, manufacture, sale and use of pest management products, including Regalia, Grandevo, Zequanox, Venerate, Majestene/Zelto, Stargus/Amplitude and other products we are developing, are extensively regulated by the EPA and state, local and foreign governmental authorities. These regulations substantially increase the time and cost associated with bringing our products to market. If we do not receive the necessary governmental approvals to test, manufacture and market our products, or if regulatory authorities revoke our approvals, do not grant approvals in a timely manner or grant approvals subject to restrictions on their use, we may be unable to sell our products in the United States or other jurisdictions, which could result in a reduction in our future revenues.\nWe have received approval from the EPA for the active ingredients and certain end product formulations for Regalia, Grandevo, Zequanox, Venerate, Majestene/Zelto, Stargus/Amplitude, MBI-601, MBI-005 and MBI-011. As we introduce new formulations of and applications for our products, we need to seek EPA approval prior to commercial sale. For any such approval, the EPA may require us to fulfill certain conditions within a specified period of time following initial approval. We are also required to obtain regulatory approval from other state and foreign regulatory authorities before we market our products in their jurisdictions, some of which have taken, and may take, longer than anticipated.\nSome of these states and foreign countries may apply different criteria than the EPA in their approval processes. Although federal pesticide law preempts separate state and local pesticide registration requirements to some extent, state and local governments retain authority to control pesticide use within their borders.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for marketing our additional products or new product formulations and applications we are developing. Although the EPA has in place a registration procedure for biopesticides like Regalia and Grandevo that is streamlined in comparison to the registration procedure for conventional chemical pesticides, there can be no assurance that all of our products or product extensions will be eligible for this streamlined procedure or that additional requirements will not be mandated by the EPA that could make the procedure more time consuming and costly for our future products.\nAdditionally, for California state registration and registration in jurisdictions outside of the United States, all products need to be proven efficacious for each proposed crop-pest combination, which can require costly field trial testing, and a favorable result is not assured. Because many of the products that may be sold by us must be registered with one or more government agencies, the registration process can be time consuming and expensive, and there is no guarantee that the product will obtain all required registrations. We have intentionally obtained registration in some jurisdictions and not in others. California is one of the largest and most important producers of agricultural products in the world. As such, we view California as one of the most natural and attractive markets for our products, but it is also very stringent in its regulations, generally requiring more time and effort, and lacking legally mandated deadlines for its reviews of reduced-risk biopesticides. Therefore, gaining concurrent approvals with the EPA, other states other countries may not always be achievable. Even if we obtain all necessary regulatory approvals to market and sell our products, they will be subject to continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements, including periodic re-registrations. The EPA, as well as state and foreign regulatory authorities, could withdraw a previously approved product from the market upon receipt of newly discovered information, including an inability to comply with their regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unanticipated problems with our products, or for other reasons.\nAdverse weather conditions, climate change and other natural conditions can reduce acreage planted or incidence of crop disease or pest infestations, which can adversely affect our results of operations.\nProduction of the crops on which our products are typically applied is vulnerable to extreme weather conditions such as heavy rains, hurricanes, hail, tornadoes, freezing conditions, drought, fires and floods. Weather conditions can be impacted by climate change resulting from global warming, including changes in precipitation patterns and the increased frequency of extreme weather events, or other factors. Unfavorable weather conditions can reduce both acreages planted and incidence (or timing) of certain crop diseases or pest infestations, each of which may reduce demand for our products. For example, since 2012, global warming has led all or parts of the United States to experience abnormally low rainfall or drought relative to historical periods, reducing the incidence of fungal diseases such as mildews and the demand for fungicides such as Regalia. These conditions have persisted or worsened particularly in California and the Pacific Northwest, resulting in continued reductions in acreage planted throughout those regions. Shortened bloom cycles relating to changes in weather patterns also could reduce the amount of pesticides and plant health products used during a growing season. For example, in 2014, the Florida citrus market experienced a shortened bloom cycle as a result of changes in weather patterns, which negatively affected our sales of Grandevo in the Florida market. Climate change has also led to increasingly powerful hurricanes, which disrupt agriculture and significantly affected sales of crop protection products to Florida and Puerto Rico in the third and fourth quarters of 2017.\nIn addition, ideal weather conditions can reduce the incidence of diseases and pest infestations and increase yields without the use of additional pesticide and plant health applications. Increased yields can also reduce commodity prices causing growers to make a decision not to increase costs by reducing the amount of pesticides and plant health products used during a growing season. Since all of our products have different margins, changes in product mix as a result of these conditions could affect our overall margins.\nOur product sales are subject to weather conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly quarterly and annually.\nIn recent years, we have increasingly had higher sales during the first half of the year than the second half, and expect this trend to continue. However, the level of seasonality in our business may change due to a number of factors, including our expansion into new geographical territories, the introduction of new products, the timing of introductions of new formulations and products, the addition or changes to distributors or distributor programs and the impact of weather and climate change. It is possible that our business may become more seasonal, or experience seasonality in different periods.\nNotwithstanding any such seasonality, we expect substantial fluctuation in sales year over year and quarter over quarter as a result of a number of variables on which sales of our products are dependent. Weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors affect planting and growing seasons and incidence of pests and plant disease, and accordingly affect decisions by our distributors, direct customers and end users about the types and amounts of pest management and plant health products to purchase and the timing of use of such products. In addition, disruptions that cause delays by growers in harvesting or planting can result in the movement of orders to a future quarter, which would negatively affect the quarter and cause fluctuations in our operating results. Customers also may purchase large quantities of our products in a particular quarter to store and use over long periods of time or time their purchases to manage their inventories, which may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results for a particular quarter or year, and low commodity prices may discourage growers from purchasing our products in an effort to reduce their costs and increase their margins for a growing season.\nOur expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future sales. As a result, any shortfall in sales relative to our expectations could cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter, which could result in uncertainty surrounding our level of earnings and possibly a decrease in our stock price.\nBio-based pest management and plant health products are not well understood, which necessitates investment in customer education and makes effectively marketing and selling our products difficult.\nThe market for bio-based pest management and plant health products is underdeveloped when compared to conventional pesticides. Customers in the crop production sector and the water treatment sector are generally cautious in their adoption of new products and technologies. Growers often require on-farm demonstrations of a given pest management or plant health product. Initial purchases of the product tend to be conservative, with the grower testing on a small portion of their overall crop. As the product is proven, growers incorporate the product into their rotational programs and deploy it on a greater percentage of their operations. As a result, large scale adoption generally takes several growing seasons. Water treatment products must also pass efficacy and ecological toxicity tests. In addition, given the relative novelty of our water treatment products, consumers of those products will continue to require education on their use, which may delay their adoption.\nIn addition, customers have historically perceived bio-based pest management products as more expensive and less effective than conventional chemical pesticides. To succeed, we will need to continue to change that perception. To the extent that the market for bio-based pest management products does not further develop or customers elect to continue to purchase and rely on conventional chemical pesticides, our market opportunity will be limited.\nThe high level of competition in the market for pest management and plant health products may result in pricing pressure, reduced margins or the inability of our products to achieve market acceptance.\nThe markets for pest management and plant health products are intensely competitive, rapidly changing and undergoing consolidation. We may be unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which may result in price reductions, reduced margins and the inability to achieve market acceptance for our products.\nMany entities are engaged in developing pest management and plant health products. Our competitors include major multinational agrichemical companies such as UPL/Arysta, BASF, Bayer, Corteva Agriscience (owned by DowDuPont), FMC, Monsanto, Sumitomo Chemical and Syngenta, some of which have developed bio-based products for our target markets, as well as specialized bio-based pesticide and plant health businesses such as AgraQuest (now a part of Bayer), Certis USA (now a part of Mitsui), Novozymes (in a joint venture with Monsanto) and Valent Biosciences (now a part of Sumitomo). Many of these organizations have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources, greater brand recognition and a larger base of customers than we do. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the manufacture, promotion or sale of their products, receive greater resources and support from independent distributors, initiate or withstand substantial price competition or more readily take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities. Further, many of the large agrichemical companies have a more diversified product offering than we do, which may give these companies an advantage in meeting customers\u2019 needs by enabling them to offer a broader range of pest management and plant health solutions. In addition, we could face competition in the future from new, well-financed start-up companies such as AgBiome and Indigo.\nWe rely on the experience and expertise of our senior management team and other key personnel, and if we are unable to recruit or retain qualified personnel, our development and commercialization efforts may be significantly delayed.\nWe depend heavily on the principal members of our management, particularly Pamela G. Marrone, Ph.D., our founder and Chief Executive Officer, the loss of whose services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our scientific or business objectives. Although we maintain and are the beneficiary of $10.0 million in key person life insurance policies for the life of Dr. Marrone, we do not believe the proceeds would be adequate to compensate us for her loss.\nWe have a lean level staffing, and rely on qualified sales and marketing, research and development and management personnel to succeed. For example, the departures of our former chief operating officer and significant members of our sales staff in the third quarter of 2014 and subsequent turnover in our sales and marketing department adversely impacted our business by disrupting the 2014 launch of Venerate as well as the growth in sales of our other commercialized products, including Regalia and Grandevo. In addition, we had significant turnover in our sales and marketing department during the fourth quarter of 2017, which we believe impacted our sales during that quarter and could impact our sales in the near-term. The process of hiring, training and successfully integrating qualified personnel into our operation is lengthy and expensive. The market for qualified personnel, such as experienced fermentation engineers and formulation chemists, is very competitive because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our technology and anticipated products, and few sales and marketing personnel have prior experience with bio-based products. Perceived instability and risk in our business has made it difficult to retain qualified personnel and could impair our ability to meet our business objectives and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers are unable to produce our products at a satisfactory quality, in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities or at an acceptable cost, our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe have transitioned the majority of our manufacturing processes in-house to our facility in Bangor, Michigan. If severe weather, a fire or natural disaster occurs, a contaminant grows in our fermentations, or a mechanical or labor problem leads to a reduced capacity or shutdown of our fermenters or other equipment, we may not be successful in producing the amount and quality of product we anticipate in the facility and our results of operations may suffer as a result.\nWe also continue to rely on third parties to formulate Grandevo and Zequanox into spray-dried powders, for all of our production of Venerate, Majestene/Zelto, Stargus/Amplitude and Haven, and from time to time, we expect to use third-party manufacturers for supplemental production capacity to meet excess seasonal demand and for packaging. Our reliance on third parties to manufacture our products presents significant risks to us, including the following:\n\u25cf reduced control over delivery schedules, yields and product reliability;\n\u25cf price increases;\n\u25cf manufacturing deviations from internal and regulatory specifications, including contaminations;\n\u25cf the failure of a key manufacturer to perform its obligations to us for technical, market or other reasons;\n\u25cf challenges presented by introducing our fermentation processes to new manufacturers or deploying them in new facilities, including contaminations;\n\u25cf difficulties in establishing additional manufacturers if we are presented with the need to transfer our manufacturing process technologies to them;\n\u25cf misappropriation of our intellectual property; and\n\u25cf other risks in potentially meeting our product commercialization schedule or satisfying the requirements of our distributors, direct customers and end users.\nWe have not entered into any long-term manufacturing or supply agreements for any of our products, and we may need to enter into additional agreements for the commercial development, manufacturing and sale of our products. There can be no assurance that we can do so on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur products have been produced in quantities, and on timelines, sufficient to meet commercial demand and for us to satisfy our delivery schedules. However, our dependence upon others for the production of a portion of our products, or for a portion of the manufacturing process, particularly for drying and for all our production of Venerate, may adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand and meet delivery obligations, as well as to develop and commercialize new products, on a timely and competitive basis. If manufacturing capacity is reduced or eliminated at one or more of our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders, which could adversely affect customer relationships, and our net revenues and results of operations could decline.\nWe must accurately forecast demand for our products to obtain adequate and cost-effective capacity from our third-party manufacturers and to purchase certain of the raw materials used in our products at cost-effective rates. Our third-party manufacturers are not required to supply us products until we place, and they accept, our purchase orders, which generally occurs approximately three months prior to the anticipated product delivery dated to customers based on our own rolling forecasts. Our purchase orders may not be accepted and our third-party manufacturers may not be willing to provide us with additional products on a timely basis if they prioritize orders placed by other companies, many of whom are more established than us and order larger volumes of products. In addition, while raw material orders are generally placed one month in advance of suppliers orders, because certain of the raw materials used in our products are in short supply or are subject to capacity demands, we place some raw material orders approximately six months in advance to avoid paying higher prices. Accordingly, if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products, we may be unable to meet our customers\u2019 delivery requirements, or we may accumulate excess inventories of products and raw materials.\nFailure to achieve expected manufacturing yields and pesticidal activity or contamination of our production runs could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe do not know whether a yield problem exists until our products are manufactured. When a yield issue is identified, the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause. As a result, yield deficiencies may not be identified until well into the production process. We may experience inability to ramp up yields in our own manufacturing facility or third-party manufacturers. In the event that we continue to rely on third-party manufacturers, resolution of yield problems requires cooperation among, and communication between, us and our manufacturers. Third-party manufacturers as well as our own plant in Michigan may contaminate the runs of our products while in process, causing a run failure and causing us to miss sales opportunities or a season. We will not succeed if we cannot maintain or decrease our production costs and effectively scale our technology and manufacturing processes with the desired yields and pesticidal activity and without contaminations.\nWe rely on a single supplier based in China for a key ingredient of Regalia.\nThe active ingredient in our Regalia product line is derived from the giant knotweed plant, which we obtain from China. Our single supplier acquires raw knotweed from numerous regional sources and performs an extraction process on this plant, following our specifications, thus creating a dried extract that is shipped to our manufacturing facility in Bangor, Michigan. Although we have identified additional sources of knotweed at competitive prices that appear to be reliable and of appropriate quality, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain dried extract from China at a competitive price point, including due to impact of any deterioration in the trade relationship between the United States and China such as tariffs placed on Chinese goods exported to the United States, changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Renminbi and potential actions taken by regulators in China. We endeavor to keep 6 months of knotweed extract on hand at any given time and have identified and qualified other knotweed suppliers.\nOther ingredients used in the manufacturing of our products are also sourced from a limited number of suppliers. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain such ingredients reliably and of appropriate quality at a competitive price point.\nOur efforts on Zequanox may not result in increased sales.\nOur Zequanox product line is principally designed to control invasive mussels that restrict critical water flow in industrial and power facilities and impinge on access to recreational waters. Due to our prioritization plan, we have not committed sufficient resources to this product in order to market it full-scale. Our collective ability to generate significant revenues from Zequanox has been dependent on persuading customers to evaluate the costs of our Zequanox products compared to the overall cost of the chlorine treatment process, the primary current alternative to using Zequanox, rather than the cost of purchasing chemicals alone. Sales of Zequanox could remain lower than our other products due to the length of the treatment cycle, the longer sales cycle (the bidding process with utility companies and government agencies occurs on a yearly or multi-year basis) and the unique nature of the treatment approach for each customer based on the extent of the infestation and the design of the facility.\nAny decline in U.S. agricultural production could have a material adverse effect on the market for pesticides and on our results of operations and financial position.\nConditions in the U.S. agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results. The U.S. agricultural industry has contracted in recent periods, and can be affected by a number of factors, including weather patterns and field conditions, current and projected grain inventories and prices, domestic and international demand for U.S. agricultural products and U.S. and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products. State and federal governmental policies, including farm subsidies and commodity support programs, as well as the prices of fertilizer products and the prices at which produce may be sold, may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted, the mix of crops planted and the use of pesticides for particular agricultural applications.\nOur intellectual property is integral to our business. If we are unable to protect our patents and proprietary rights in the United States and foreign countries, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights protection for our technologies and products in the United States and other countries. If we are unable to obtain or maintain these protections, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary rights. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. As of December 31, 2018, we had 42 issued U.S. patents and 294 issued foreign patents (of which 3 U.S. patents and 45 foreign patents were in-licensed), 19 pending provisional and non-provisional U.S. patent applications (of which 1 was in-licensed) and 93 pending foreign patent applications (of which 5 were in-licensed).\nThe patent position of biotechnology and biochemical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition, recent changes to the patent laws of the United States provide additional procedures for third parties to challenge the validity of issued patents, some of which allow a lower evidentiary standard to hold a patent claim invalid. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems and costs in protecting our proprietary rights in these foreign countries.\nOur patents, and those patents for which we have license rights, may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage. We are not certain that our pending patent applications will be issued. Moreover, our competitors could challenge or circumvent our patents or pending patent applications. It is also not possible to patent and protect all knowledge and know-how associated with our products, so there may be areas that are not protected such as certain formulations and manufacturing processes. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nFor certain of our products, we hold co-exclusive licenses to certain of the intellectual property related to these products. Although our products that are derived from intellectual property licensed to us on a co-exclusive basis also include our own proprietary technology, the third parties with whom we share co-exclusive rights may develop products based on the same underlying intellectual property. This could adversely affect the sale of our products.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development, sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nWe have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and know-how, including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and third-party manufacturers. It is possible that these agreements may be breached and that any remedies for a breach will not make us whole. In addition, some courts inside and outside of the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. We generally control and limit access to, and the distribution of, our product documentation and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect these proprietary rights, our trade secret-protected know-how could fall into the public domain, and unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We also cannot guarantee that other parties will not independently develop our knowhow or otherwise obtain access to our technologies.\nThird parties may misappropriate our microbial strains.\nThird parties, including contract manufacturers, often have custody or control of our microbial strains. If our microbial strains were stolen, misappropriated or reverse engineered, they could be used by other parties who may be able to reproduce the microbial strains for their own commercial gain. If this were to occur, it would be difficult for us to challenge and prevent this type of use, especially in countries with limited intellectual property protection.\nOther companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property or proprietary rights, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment such as ours in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed, with regard to similar technologies. Patents issued to third parties may contain claims that conflict with our patents and that may place restrictions on the commercial viability of our products and technologies. Third parties could assert infringement claims against us in the future. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products, product candidates and technology. We may not be aware of all such third-party intellectual property rights potentially relevant to our products and product candidates.\nAny litigation, adversarial proceeding or proceeding before governmental authorities regarding intellectual property rights, regardless of its outcome, would probably be costly and require significant time and attention of our key management and technical personnel. Litigation, adversarial proceedings or proceedings before governmental authorities could also force us to:\n\u25cf stop or delay selling, manufacturing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u25cf pay damages; and/or\n\u25cf enter into licensing or royalty agreements which, if available at all, may only be available on unfavorable terms.\nClaims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe use hazardous materials in our business and are subject to potential liability under environmental laws. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials could be time consuming and costly to resolve.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, disposal and release of hazardous materials and certain waste products. Our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and/or biological waste. Some of these materials may be novel, including bacteria with novel properties and bacteria that produce biologically active compounds. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any injury resulting from these materials. In addition, although we have not currently identified any environmental liabilities, the manufacturing facility we purchased in July 2012 may have existing environmental liabilities associated with it that may also result in successor liabilities for us, and we will be subject to increased exposure to potential environmental liabilities as we manufacture our products on a larger scale. We may also be held liable for hazardous materials brought onto the premises of our manufacturing facility before we acquired title, without regard for fault for, or knowledge of, the presence of such substances, as well as for hazardous materials that may be discovered after we no longer own the property if we sell it in the future. In the event of an accident, or if any hazardous materials are found within our operations or on the premises of our manufacturing facility in violation of the law at any time, we may be liable for all cleanup costs, fines, penalties and other costs. This liability could exceed our resources, and, if significant losses arise from hazardous substance contamination, our financial viability may be substantially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations. We cannot predict the impact of new governmental regulations that might have an adverse effect on the research, development, production and marketing of our products. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations. Our business may be harmed by the cost of compliance.\nOur collaborators may use hazardous materials in connection with our collaborative efforts. To our knowledge, their work is performed in accordance with applicable biosafety regulations. In the event of a lawsuit or investigation, however, we could be held responsible for any injury caused to persons or property by exposure to, or release of, hazardous materials used by these parties. Further, we may be required to indemnify our collaborators against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations.\nOur headquarters and other facilities and certain manufacturers and suppliers are located in regions that are subject to natural disasters, as well as in some cases geopolitical risks and social upheaval.\nThe impact of a major earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, including floods, on our Davis facilities, Bangor, Michigan manufacturing plant, infrastructure and overall operations is difficult to predict, and any natural disaster could seriously disrupt our entire business process. In addition, Haven is produced by a third-party manufacturer in Florida in a location that could be impacted by hurricane activity, and certain of our raw materials are sourced in China, which is subject to risks associated with uncertain political, economic and other conditions such as the outbreak of contagious diseases, such as avian flu, swine flu and SARS, and natural disasters. The insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from natural disasters or other business interruptions. Although these risks have not materially adversely affected our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, there can be no assurance that such risks will not do so in the future.\nInability to comply with regulations applicable to our facilities and procedures could delay, limit or prevent our research and development or manufacturing activities.\nOur research and development and manufacturing facilities and procedures are subject to continual review and periodic inspection. We must spend funds, time and effort in the areas of production, safety and quality control and assurance to ensure full technical compliance with the regulations applicable to these facilities and procedures. If the EPA or another regulatory body determines that we are not in compliance with these regulations, regulatory approval of our products could be delayed, or we may be required to limit or cease our research and development or manufacturing activities or pay a monetary fine. If we are required to limit or cease our research and development activities, our ability to develop new products would be impaired. In addition, if we are required to limit or cease our manufacturing activities, our ability to produce our products in commercial quantities would be impaired or prohibited, which would harm our business.\nWe may be exposed to product liability and remediation claims, which could harm our business.\nThe use of certain bio-based pest management and plant health products is regulated by various local, state, federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations, may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, may require notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may ban the use of certain ingredients. Even if we are able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations, we cannot provide assurance that our products will not cause injury to crops, the environment or people under all circumstances. For example, our products may be improperly combined with other pesticides or, even when properly combined, our products may be blamed for damage caused by these other pesticides. The costs of remediation or products liability could materially adversely affect our future quarterly or annual operating results.\nWe may be held liable for, or incur costs to settle, liability and remediation claims if any products we develop, or any products that use or incorporate any of our technologies, cause injury or are found unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale or use. These risks exist even with respect to products that have received, or may in the future receive, regulatory approval, registration or clearance for commercial use. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid product liability exposure.\nWe currently maintain product liability insurance at levels we believe are sufficient and consistent with industry standards for companies at our stage of development. We cannot guarantee that our product liability insurance is adequate, and at any time, it is possible that this insurance coverage may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. A product liability claim could result in liability to us greater than our assets or insurance coverage. Moreover, even if we have adequate insurance coverage, product liability claims, or recalls could result in negative publicity or force us to devote significant time and attention to those matters, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $216.0 million of federal operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income, which expire in varying amounts beginning in 2026 if unused. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $150.4 million of state operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income, which began expiring in 2016. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use these loss carryforwards before their expiration.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes restrictions on the use of a corporation\u2019s net operating losses, as well as certain recognized built-in losses and other carryforwards, after an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs. A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Future issuances or sales of our stock (including certain transactions involving our stock that are outside of our control) could also result in an ownership change under Section 382. If an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of pre-change net operating losses and other losses we can use to reduce our taxable income generally equal to the product of the total value of our outstanding equity immediately prior to the \u201cownership change\u201d (subject to certain adjustments) and the long-term tax-exempt interest rate for the month of the \u201cownership change.\u201d The applicable rate for ownership changes occurring in the month of December 2018 was 2.51%.\nBecause U.S. federal net operating losses generally may be carried forward for up to 20 years, the annual limitation may effectively provide a cap on the cumulative amount of pre-ownership change losses, including certain recognized built-in losses that may be utilized. Such pre-ownership change losses in excess of the cap may be lost. In addition, if an ownership change were to occur, it is possible that the limitations imposed on our ability to use pre-ownership change losses and certain recognized built-in losses could cause a net increase in our U.S. federal income tax liability and U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect. Further, if the amount or value of these deferred tax assets is reduced, such reduction would have a negative impact on the book value of our common stock.\nWe completed a Section 382 analysis as of December 31, 2013 and concluded that approximately $0.5 million in federal net operating losses and approximately $0.2 million in federal research and development credits are expected to expire prior to utilization as a result of our previous ownership changes and corresponding annual limitations. We have not conducted an analysis to determine the amount of state net operating losses that are also expected to expire prior to utilization. Our existing net operating loss carryforwards or credits may be subject to significant limitations due to events occurring since December 31, 2013, and we have not updated our Section 382 analysis to consider events since December 31, 2013, including the effect of the financing transactions we completed in February 2018 and our April 2018 equity offering. Our inability to use these net operating loss carryforwards as a result of the Section 382 limitations could harm our financial condition.\nOur business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, which could subject us to civil or criminal penalties.\nThe complex legal and regulatory environment exposes us to compliance and litigation costs and risks that could materially affect our operations and financial results. These laws and regulations may change, sometimes significantly, as a result of political or economic events. They include environmental laws and regulations, tax laws and regulations, import and export laws and regulations, government contracting laws and regulations, labor and employment laws and regulations, securities and exchange laws and regulations, and other laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, proposed laws and regulations in these and other areas could affect the cost of our business operations. We face the risk of changes in both domestic and foreign laws regarding trade, potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy, misappropriation or foreign laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights. Violations of any of these laws and regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. Potential vulnerabilities can be exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-party vendors, business partners, or by malicious third parties. Attacks of this nature are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage) and expertise, including organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d nation states and others. In addition to the extraction of sensitive information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks social engineering and other means to affect service reliability.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur stock price has in the past and may in the future fail to meet minimum requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market or if we are unable to transfer our listing to another stock market.\nIn the past we have received written notifications from Nasdaq informing us that we were not in compliance with certain continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). As previously disclosed, on January 2, 2018, we received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with the rules for continued listing because we had not yet held an annual meeting of stockholders within twelve months of the end of our 2016 fiscal year end. As a result of our holding the 2017 Annual Meeting on January 31, 2018, we regained compliance with the applicable rule. There can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain compliance with the requirements for listing our common stock on Nasdaq. Delisting from Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nOur principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interest of other stockholders.\nAs of March 18, 2019, our executive officers and directors and their affiliates, including Ospraie Ag Science LLC (\u201cOspraie\u201d), beneficially owned or controlled (i.e., directly or indirectly and including exercisable warrants), an aggregate of approximately 61.3 million shares, or 43.4% of our common stock, including 27.7% of our currently outstanding shares. In addition, affiliates of Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. (\u201cWaddell\u201d), beneficially own 25.0% of our common stock and 22.3% of our currently outstanding shares, Ardsley Advisory Partners (\u201cArdsley\u201d) beneficially owns 14.0% of our common stock and 9.9% of our currently outstanding shares, and Van Herk Investments B.V. owns 10.7% of our common stock and 6.4% of our currently outstanding share. These principal stockholders collectively beneficially owned or controlled, directly or indirectly an aggregate of 73.5 million shares or 66.4% of our total common stock outstanding and if all of these security holders act together, or exercise their warrants, they will be able to exert significant control over our management and affairs, which could result in some corporate actions that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial such as failure to approve change of control transactions that could offer holders of our common stock a premium over the market value of our company. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid.\nWe have had a history of losses, and our business, financial results and stock price have been adversely affected by concerns regarding our ability to continue operations. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in August 2013 at a price of $12.00 per share, our stock price has ranged between $0.60 and $20.00 through December 31, 2018. The trading price of our common stock will likely continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include\n\u25cf our public float relative to the total number of shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our results of operations, those of our competitors or those of our customers;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations, new products or services or new commercial relationships by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf our ability to develop and market new products on a timely basis;\n\u25cf disruption to our operations;\n\u25cf media reports and publications about our financials or about pest management products;\n\u25cf announcements concerning our competitors or the pest management industry in general;\n\u25cf our entry into, modification of or termination of key license, research and development or collaborative agreements;\n\u25cf new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines or the status of our regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf general and industry-specific economic conditions;\n\u25cf any major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u25cf the commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates, including our ability to meet our future net revenues and operating profit or loss projections; and\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts.\nSubstantial future sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of March 18, 2019, we had approximately 110.7 million shares of common stock outstanding, 31.5 million which were held by our directors and officers and their affiliates and an additional 35.7 million shares which were held by other beneficial holders of 5% or more of our common stock. Although these shares are subject in some cases to volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act, any determination by holders of a substantial number of such shares to sell our stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause our stock price to decline.\nIn addition, as of March 18, 2019, we had 6.2 million shares of our common stock available to be awarded under our equity incentive plans, 1.1 million shares of our common stock issuable upon the settlement outstanding restricted stock units, 7.1 million shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted average exercise price of $3.31 per share and 52.7 million shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants with a weighted average exercise price of $1.10 per share. These shares may be sold in the public market upon issuance.\nBecause we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the board of directors deems relevant. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we may choose to take advantage of certain scaled disclosures from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to smaller reporting companies, which include, among other things:\n\u25cf reduced disclosure obligations related to Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations;\n\u25cf reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements;\n\u25cf exemption from the requirements of selected financial data and supplementary financial information; and\n\u25cf reduced income statement, cash flow, and changes in stockholders\u2019 equity statements from three years to two years.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to comply with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements, in order to comply with the rules and regulations imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq. Our management and other personnel also have devoted a substantial amount of time to ensure compliance with these initiatives, and our legal and accounting compliance costs have increased and are expected to increase in connection with the additional compliance measures. We may also need to hire additional staff or consultants in the areas of investor relations, legal and accounting, to continue to operate as a public company and greater expenditures may be necessary in the future with the advent of new laws and regulations pertaining to public companies. We also expect that, it will continue to be expensive for us to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, as a public company, we are required to perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. During 2018, we were required to comply with the auditor attestation provisions of Section 404, our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. We expect to incur substantial accounting expense and management time on compliance-related issues with respect to Section 404. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have in the past identified material weaknesses, and if we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which could adversely affect our consolidated operating results, our ability to operate our business, our stock price and investors\u2019 views of us.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to ensure that information regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, but in the past, we have identified material weaknesses in these controls. For example, in connection with management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, management identified an additional deficiency that constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 related to the accounting for embedded derivative instruments that were a part of certain loan instruments that we entered into during the year ended December 31, 2017. We developed and implemented new internal controls during 2018 and remediated this material weakness as of December 31, 2018. While we believe we have appropriately remediated the previously disclosed material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for embedded derivative instruments, we can provide no assurances that other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, will not be identified in the future.\nRemediating our material weaknesses has required substantial management time and attention, and ensuring that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis will continue to be a costly and time-consuming effort. Any failure to implement effective internal control over financial reporting or to complete and maintain the remediation of our identified control deficiencies may result in additional errors, material misstatements or delays in our financial reporting, failure to meet our financial reporting obligations or failure to avoid or detect fraud in our financial reporting. This in turn would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could have a substantial adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock and our relationships with customers and suppliers.\nOur management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company will have been detected. As discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Audit Committee and management have identified control deficiencies in the past and may identify additional deficiencies in the future.\nUnforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems, or failure to design and operate effective internal controls over information systems, could have an adverse effect on our operations and could result in ineffective internal control over our financial reporting.\nIn fourth quarter of 2016, we began the process of implementing a cloud-based enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we transitioned to our ERP system for manufacturing operations for material requirements planning, general ledger, procurement, payment, billings and cash receipts functions. This transition, including our engagement of third-party experts to help in the design, training and implementation of the new ERP system, has accounted for increases in sales, general and administrative costs, relative to prior periods. As we add functionality and increase the use of the ERP system, we will incur additional costs and problems could arise that we have not foreseen, including interruptions in service, loss of data, or reduced functionality. Such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders, and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins. As such, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we do not have experience with implementing and maintaining controls over this ERP system. While we believe we have designed the appropriate controls around this ERP system, if we have not designed controls within or around these systems that are effective at preventing and detecting unreliable data, or if we are unable to design or operate controls within or around these systems to provide effective control around program changes and access to the systems, we may be at risk for future material weaknesses. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, to be in breach of agreements with our lenders and equity inventor, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u25cf the right of our board of directors to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u25cf the establishment of a classified board of directors requiring that only a subset of the members of our board of directors be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cf the prohibition of cumulative voting in our election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf the requirement that stockholders provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to our board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms set by the board of directors, which rights could be senior to those of our common stock. The ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;\n\u25cf the inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u25cf the required approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws;\n\u25cf the required approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to repeal or adopt any provision of our certificate of incorporation regarding the election of directors;\n\u25cf the required approval of the holders of at least 80% of such shares to amend or repeal the provisions of our bylaws regarding the election and classification of directors; and\n\u25cf the required approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to remove directors without cause.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its common stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.", "PERMNO": 14099, "SIC": 2870, "TIC": "MBII"}
