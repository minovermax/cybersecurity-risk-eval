RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following material risks and uncertainties before you decide to buy our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition would likely suffer. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS\nThe current state of the global financial markets and current economic conditions may adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms and otherwise negatively impact our business.\nGlobal financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile. In recent years, operating businesses in the global economy have faced tightening credit, weakening demand for goods and services, deteriorating international liquidity conditions, and declining markets. There has been a general decline in the willingness of banks and other financial institutions to extend credit, particularly in the shipping industry. As a result, additional financing may not be available if needed and to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If additional financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to expand or meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to enhance our existing business, complete additional vessel acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. As the shipping industry is highly dependent on the availability of credit to finance and expand operations, it has been negatively affected by this decline.\nThese conditions could have an adverse effect on our industry and our business and future operating results. Our customers may curtail their capital and operating expenditure programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for our vessels and a reduction in rates and/or utilization. In addition, certain of our customers could experience an inability to pay suppliers, including us, in the event they are unable to access the capital markets to fund their business operations. Likewise, our suppliers may be unable to sustain their current level of operations, fulfill their commitments and/or fund future operations and obligations, each of which could adversely affect our operations.\nCapital expenditures and other costs necessary to operate and maintain Lower Lakes' vessels tend to increase with the age of the vessel and may also increase due to changes in governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards.\nAs of March 31, 2015, the average age of the vessels operated by Lower Lakes was approximately 54 years. The expense of maintaining, repairing and upgrading Lower Lakes' vessels typically increases with age, and after a period of time the cost necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable. For example, if the U.S. Coast Guard, Transport Canada, the American Bureau of Shipping or Lloyd's Register of Shipping (independent classification societies that inspect the hull and machinery of commercial ships to assess compliance with minimum criteria as set by U.S., Canadian and international regulations) enact new standards, Lower Lakes may be required to incur significant costs for alterations to its fleet or the addition of new equipment. In order to satisfy any such requirement, Lower Lakes may be required to take its vessels out of service for extended periods of time, with corresponding losses of revenues. There can be no assurance that Lower Lakes will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels, or that our financial resources will be sufficient to enable us to make expenditures necessary for these purposes.\nUnless we set aside reserves or are able to borrow funds for vessel replacement, we will be unable to replace the vessels in our fleet at the end of their useful lives.\nUnless we maintain reserves or are able to borrow or raise funds for vessel replacement, we will be unable to replace the vessels in our fleet upon the expiration of their remaining useful lives. In addition, the supply of replacement vessels is very limited and the costs associated with acquiring a newly constructed vessel are prohibitively high. In the event that Lower Lakes were to lose the use of any of its vessels, our financial performance would be adversely affected.\nOur practice of purchasing and operating previously owned vessels may result in increased operating costs, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe have grown our business through the acquisition of previously owned vessels. While we typically inspect previously owned vessels before purchase, this does not provide us with the same knowledge about their condition that we would have had if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by us. Accordingly, we may not discover defects or other problems with such vessels before purchase. Any such hidden defects or problems, when detected, may be expensive to repair, and if not detected, may result in accidents or other incidents for which we may become liable to third parties. Also, when purchasing previously owned vessels, we generally do not receive the benefit of any builder warranties.\nThe climate in the Great Lakes region limits Lower Lakes' vessel operations to approximately nine months per year.\nLower Lakes' operating business is seasonal, meaning that it experiences higher levels of activity in some periods of the year than in others. Ordinarily, Lower Lakes is able to operate its vessels on the Great Lakes for approximately nine months per year beginning in late March or April and continuing through December or mid-January. However, weather conditions and customer demand cause increases or decreases in the number of days Lower Lakes actually operates.\nWe depend upon a few significant customers for a large part of our revenues and cash flow, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe expect to derive a significant part of our revenue and cash flow from a relatively small number of repeat customers. For the year ended March 31, 2015, our top two customers accounted for 25.7% of our revenues and Lower Lakes' top ten customers accounted for approximately 68%, 64% and 60% of its revenue during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. If we lose a significant customer, we could suffer a loss of revenues that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe shipping industry has inherent operational risks that may not be adequately covered by Lower Lakes' insurance.\nLower Lakes maintains insurance on its fleet for risks commonly insured against by vessel owners and operators, including hull and machinery insurance, war risks insurance and protection and indemnity insurance (which includes environmental damage and pollution insurance). Lower Lakes does not, however, insure the loss of a vessel's income when it is being repaired due to an insured hull and machinery claim. We can give no assurance that Lower Lakes will be adequately insured against all risks or that its insurers will pay a particular claim. Even if its insurance coverage is adequate to cover its losses, Lower Lakes may not be able to timely obtain a replacement vessel in the event of a loss. Furthermore, in the future, Lower Lakes may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates for Lower Lakes' fleet. Lower Lakes may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claims record but also the claims record of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which Lower Lakes may receive indemnity insurance coverage. Lower Lakes' insurance policies will also contain deductibles, limitations and exclusions which, although we believe are standard in the shipping industry, may nevertheless increase its costs.\nLower Lakes is subject to certain risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing our revenues and earnings.\nLower Lakes enters into contracts of affreightment (COAs) pursuant to which Lower Lakes agrees to carry cargoes, typically for industrial customers, who transport dry bulk cargoes. Lower Lakes also enters into spot market voyage contracts, where Lower Lakes is paid a rate per ton to carry a specified cargo from one location to another. All of these contracts, as well as the various other contracts that are material to the operation of our business, subject Lower Lakes to counterparty risk. As a result, we are subject to counterparty risks at various levels, including with charterers, cargo interests, or terminal customers. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, Lower Lakes could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease our revenues and earnings.\nLower Lakes may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its debt service obligations.\nLower Lakes' ability to make payments on its indebtedness will depend on its ability to generate cash from its future operations. Lower Lakes' business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or from other sources sufficient to enable it to repay its indebtedness and to fund its liquidity needs, including capital expenditures and winter work expenses. Lower Lakes may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity. Lower Lakes may not be able to refinance any of its indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If Lower Lakes cannot service or refinance its indebtedness, it may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, Lower Lakes may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nA significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which may expose us to higher interest payments.\nAll of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which makes us more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic conditions, increases in prevailing interest rates, or a downturn in our business. As of March 31, 2015, approximately $173.7 million aggregate principal, or all of our indebtedness, which represents the outstanding principal under our credit facilities, was subject to floating interest rates. We currently have interest rate cap contracts which cover approximately 62% of first lien loan as of March 31, 2015. These contracts will terminate on December 1, 2015.\nA default under Lower Lakes' indebtedness may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn the event of a default under Lower Lakes\u2019 indebtedness, the holders of the indebtedness under Lower Lakes\u2019 credit facilities generally would be able to declare all of the indebtedness under such facilities, together with accrued interest, to be due and payable. In addition, borrowings under Lower Lakes\u2019 senior credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of Lower Lakes Towing, Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River, Black Creek and the other guarantors and, in the event of a default under that facility, the lenders thereunder generally would be entitled to seize the collateral, including assets which are necessary to operate our business. Borrowings under Lower Lakes\u2019 second-lien credit facility are secured by a second priority lien on all of the assets of Lower Lakes Towing, Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River, Black Creek and the other guarantors. Subject to the terms of the intercreditor agreement between the lenders under our senior credit facility and the lenders under our second-lien credit facility, in the event of a default under our second-lien credit facility, the lenders thereunder generally would be entitled to seize the collateral, including assets which are necessary to operate our business. In addition, default under one debt instrument within Lower Lakes\u2019 credit facilities could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those other instruments to be due and payable pursuant to cross default and cross acceleration clauses. Moreover, upon the occurrence of an event of default under Lower Lakes' credit facilities, the commitment of the lenders to make any further loans to us could be terminated. Accordingly, the occurrence of a default under any debt instrument, unless cured or waived, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nServicing debt could limit funds available for other purposes, such as the payment of dividends.\nLower Lakes will use cash to pay the principal and interest on its debt, and to fund capital expenditures, drydock costs and winter work expenses. Such payments limit funds that would otherwise be available for other purposes, including distributions of cash to our stockholders.\nLower Lakes' credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that will limit its liquidity and corporate activities.\nThe terms of our credit facilities require us to meet certain financial covenants that are customary with these types of credit facilities and also contain affirmative covenants and events of default, including payment defaults, covenant defaults and cross defaults. If an event of default occurs, the agent would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the outstanding credit facilities.\nThe credit facilities also contain certain negative covenants, including those that restrict our ability, and that of our subsidiaries and the other guarantors, to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions, including, among other things, limitations on our ability to:\no\nincur additional indebtedness;\no\ncreate additional liens on its assets;\no\nsell or acquire assets or businesses;\no\nchange the nature of their businesses;\no\nmake investments;\no\nengage in mergers or acquisitions or transactions with related parties; or\no\npay dividends.\nTherefore, Lower Lakes will need to seek permission from its lenders in order to engage in some corporate actions. Lower Lakes' lenders' interests may be different from those of Lower Lakes and no assurance can be given that Lower Lakes will be able to obtain its lenders' permission when needed. This may prevent Lower Lakes from taking actions that are in its best interest.\nBecause Lower Lakes generates approximately 60% of its revenues and expenses in Canadian dollars, exchange rate fluctuations could cause us to suffer reduced U.S. dollar earnings.\nLower Lakes generates a significant portion of its revenues and incurs a significant portion of its expenses in Canadian dollars. This could lead to fluctuations in our net income due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Canadian Dollar.\nLower Lakes depends upon unionized labor for its U.S. operations. Any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt its business.\nAll of Grand River's shipboard employees are unionized with the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, AFL-CIO. Any work stoppages or other labor disturbances could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA labor union has attempted to unionize Lower Lakes' Canadian employees.\nThe Seafarers International Union of Canada, or SIU, attempted without success to organize Lower Lakes' unlicensed Canadian employees several years ago. The SIU regularly disseminates union information to determine the level of interest among our employees. Although we believe that support for this union is low, if SIU is ever successful in organizing a union among Lower Lakes' Canadian employees, it could result in an increased cost structure and/or reduced productivity for Lower Lakes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLower Lakes' employees are covered by U.S. Federal laws that may subject it to job-related claims in addition to those provided by state laws.\nAll of Grand River's shipboard employees are covered by the Jones Act and general maritime law. These laws typically operate to make liability limits established by state workers' compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and to permit these employees and their representatives to pursue actions against employers for job-related injuries in Federal courts. Because Lower Lakes is not generally protected by the limits imposed by state workers' compensation statutes, Lower Lakes has greater exposure for claims made by these employees as compared to employers whose employees are not covered by these provisions.\nOur capital stock is subject to restriction on foreign ownership and possible required divestiture by non-U.S. citizen stockholders.\nUnder U.S. maritime laws, in order for us to maintain our eligibility to own and operate vessels in the U.S. domestic trade, 75% of our outstanding capital stock and voting power is required to be held by U.S. citizens. Although our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions limiting non-citizenship ownership of our capital stock, we could lose our ability to conduct operations in the U.S. domestic trade if such provisions prove unsuccessful in maintaining the required level of citizen ownership. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If our board of directors determines that persons who are not citizens of the U.S. own more than 23% of our outstanding capital stock or more than 23% of our voting power, we may redeem such stock or, if redemption is not permitted by applicable law or if our board of directors, in its discretion, elects not to make such redemption, we may require the non-citizens who most recently acquired shares to divest such excess shares to persons who are U.S. citizens in such manner as our board of directors directs. The required redemption would be at a price equal to the average closing price during the preceding 30 trading days, which price could be materially different from the current price of the common stock or the price at which the non-citizen acquired the common stock. If a non-citizen purchases the common stock, there can be no assurance that he or she will not be required to divest the shares and such divestiture could result in a material loss. Such restrictions and redemption rights may make Rand's equity securities less attractive to potential investors, which may result in Rand's publicly traded common stock having a lower market price than it might have in the absence of such restrictions and redemption rights.\nOur business is dependent upon key personnel whose loss may adversely impact our business.\nWe depend on the expertise, experience and continued services of Lower Lakes' senior management employees, especially Scott Bravener, its President. Mr. Bravener has acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Lower Lakes and its operations and most decisions concerning the business of Lower Lakes are made or significantly influenced by him. The loss of Mr. Bravener or other senior management employees, or an inability to attract or retain other key individuals, could materially adversely affect our business. We seek to compensate and incentivize executives, as well as other employees, through competitive salaries and bonus plans, but there can be no assurance that these programs will allow us to retain key employees or hire new key employees. As a result, if Mr. Bravener or other senior management employees were to leave Lower Lakes, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring a qualified successor or successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and experience.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain qualified, skilled employees or crew necessary to operate our business.\nOur continued success depends in significant part on the continued services of the officers and seamen who operate our vessels. In crewing our vessels, we require technically skilled employees with specialized training who can perform physically demanding work. Competition to attract and retain qualified crew members is intense. If we are not able to increase our rates to compensate for any crew cost increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any inability we experience in the future to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could impair our ability to manage, maintain and grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to litigation, arbitration and other proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business, or otherwise. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, securities, or maritime matters. The potential costs to resolve any claim or other litigation matter, or a combination of these, may have a material adverse effect on us because of potential negative outcomes, the costs associated with asserting our claims or defending such lawsuits, and the diversion of management's attention to these matters.\nThe conversion of our series A convertible preferred stock will result in significant and immediate dilution of our existing stockholders and the book value of their common stock.\nThe shares of series A convertible preferred stock issued in connection with the acquisition of Lower Lakes are convertible into 2,419,355 shares of our common stock, subject to certain adjustments, which, on an \u201cas converted\u201d basis, represents approximately 12% of our aggregate outstanding common stock. The conversion price of our series A convertible preferred stock is subject to weighted average anti-dilution provisions whereby, if Rand issues shares in the future for consideration below the existing conversion price of $6.20, then the conversion price of the series A convertible preferred stock would automatically be decreased, allowing the holders of the series A convertible preferred stock to receive additional shares of common stock upon conversion. Upon any conversion of the series A convertible preferred stock, the equity interests of our existing common stockholders, as a percentage of the total number of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and the net book value of the shares of our common stock will be significantly diluted.\nWe may issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock to raise additional capital, including to complete a future acquisition, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share. We currently have 31,484,788 authorized but unissued shares of our common stock available for issuance (after appropriate reservation for the issuance of shares upon full exercise of our outstanding employee stock options) and 700,000 shares of preferred stock available for issuance. Although we currently have no other commitments to issue any additional shares of our common or preferred stock, we may in the future determine to issue additional shares of our common or preferred stock to raise additional capital for a variety of purposes, including to complete a future acquisition. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock may significantly reduce the equity interest of stockholders and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nFuture acquisitions of vessels or businesses by Rand or Lower Lakes would subject Rand and Lower Lakes to additional business, operating and industry risks, the impact of which cannot presently be evaluated, and could adversely impact Rand's or Lower Lakes' capital structure.\nRand intends to pursue acquisition opportunities in an effort to diversify its investments and/or grow its business. While neither Rand nor Lower Lakes is presently committed to any acquisition, Rand may be actively pursuing one or more potential acquisition opportunities.\nFuture acquisitions may be of individual or groups of vessels or of businesses operating in the shipping or other industries. Rand is not limited to any particular industry or type of business that it may acquire. Accordingly, there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular business or assets that Rand may acquire, or of the industry in which any such business may operate. To the extent Rand acquires an operating business, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the acquired business's operations.\nIn addition, the financing of any acquisition completed by Rand could adversely impact Rand's capital structure as any such financing could include the issuance of additional equity securities and/or the borrowing of additional funds. The issuance of additional equity securities may significantly dilute the equity interest of existing stockholders and/or adversely affect prevailing market prices for Rand's common stock. Increasing Rand's indebtedness could increase the risk of a default that would entitle the holder to declare all of such indebtedness due and payable and/or to seize any collateral securing the indebtedness. In addition, default under one debt instrument could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those other instruments to be due and payable pursuant to cross default clauses. Accordingly, the financing of future acquisitions could adversely impact our capital structure and your equity interest in Rand.\nExcept as required by law or the rules of any securities exchange on which our securities might be listed at the time we seek to consummate an acquisition, you will not be asked to vote on any proposed acquisition.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability and harm our reputation and business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, personal information, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer systems and, if successful, misappropriate personal or confidential business information. In addition, an associate, contractor, or other third-party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Any such compromise of our data security and access, public disclosure, or loss of personal or confidential business information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers\u2019 willingness to transact business with us, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could adversely affect our business.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY\nThe cyclical nature of the Great Lakes dry bulk shipping industry may lead to decreases in shipping rates, which may reduce Lower Lakes' revenue and earnings.\nThe shipping business, including the dry cargo market, has been cyclical in varying degrees, experiencing fluctuations in charter rates, profitability and, consequently, vessel values. Rand anticipates that the future demand for Lower Lakes' dry bulk carriers and dry bulk charter rates will be dependent upon continued demand for commodities, economic growth in the United States and Canada, seasonal and regional changes in demand, and changes to the capacity of the Great Lakes fleet which cannot be predicted. Adverse economic, political, social or other developments could decrease demand and growth in the shipping industry and thereby reduce revenue and earnings. Fluctuations, and the demand for vessels, in general, have been influenced by, among other factors:\no\nglobal and regional economic conditions;\no\ndevelopments in international and Great Lakes trade;\no\nchanges in seaborne and other transportation patterns, such as port congestion and canal closures;\no\nweather, water levels and crop yields;\no\npolitical developments; and\no\nembargoes and strikes.\nThe market values of Lower Lakes' vessels may decrease, which could cause Lower Lakes to breach covenants in its credit facilities, which could reduce earnings and revenues as a result of potential foreclosures.\nVessel values are influenced by several factors, including:\no\nchanges in environmental and other regulations that may limit the useful life of vessels;\no\nchanges in Great Lakes dry bulk commodity supply and demand;\no\ntypes and sizes of vessels;\no\ndevelopment of and increase in use of other modes of transportation;\no\ncosts of new buildings;\no\ntechnological advances;\no\ngovernmental or other regulations; and\no\nprevailing level of contract of affreightment rates and charter rates.\nIf the market values of Lower Lakes' owned vessels decrease, Lower Lakes may breach some of the covenants contained in its credit facilities. If Lower Lakes breaches such covenants and is unable to remedy the relevant breach, Lower Lakes' lenders could accelerate their debt and foreclose on the collateral, including Lower Lakes' vessels. Any loss of vessels would significantly decrease the ability of Rand to generate revenue and income. In addition, if the book value of a vessel is impaired due to unfavorable market conditions, or a vessel is sold at a price below its book value, Rand would incur a loss that would reduce earnings.\nA failure to pass inspection by classification societies and regulators could result in one or more vessels being unemployable unless and until they pass inspection, resulting in a loss of revenues from such vessels for that period and a corresponding decrease in earnings, which may be material.\nThe hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry, as well as being subject to survey and inspection by shipping regulatory bodies such as Transport Canada. The classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and the United Nations Safety of Life at Sea Convention. Lower Lakes' owned fleet is currently enrolled with either the American Bureau of Shipping or Lloyd's Register of Shipping.\nA vessel must undergo Annual Surveys, Intermediate Surveys, and Special Surveys by its classification society, as well as periodic inspections by shipping regulators. In lieu of a special survey, a vessel\u2019s machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle, under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five-year period. Lower Lakes' vessels are on Special Survey cycles for hull inspection and continuous survey cycles for machinery inspection. Every vessel is also required to be drydocked every five years for inspection of the underwater parts of such vessel during the special survey.\nDue to the age of several of the vessels, the repairs and remediations required in connection with such classification society surveys and other inspections may be extensive and require significant expenditures. Additionally, until such time as certain repairs and remediations required in connection with such surveys and inspections are completed (or if any vessel fails such a survey or inspection), the vessel may be unable to trade between ports and, therefore, would be unemployable. Any such loss of the use of a vessel could have an adverse impact on Rand's revenues, results of operations and liquidity, and any such impact may be material.\nLower Lakes' business would be adversely affected if Lower Lakes failed to comply with U.S. maritime laws or the Coasting Trade Act (Canada) provisions on coastwise trade, or if those provisions were modified or repealed.\nRand is subject to the Jones Act, other U.S. laws and the Coasting Trade Act (Canada) that restrict domestic maritime transportation to vessels operating under the flag of the subject state. In the case of the United States, vessels must be at least 75% owned and operated by U.S. citizens and manned by U.S. crews and, in addition, the vessels must have been built in the United States. Compliance with the foregoing legislation increases the operating costs of the vessels. With respect to its U.S. flagged vessels, Rand is responsible for monitoring the ownership of its capital stock to ensure compliance with U.S. maritime laws. If Rand does not comply with these restrictions, Rand will be prohibited from operating its vessels in U.S. coastwise trade, and under certain circumstances Rand will be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading rights for its vessels, and fines or forfeiture of the vessels.\nOver the past decade, interest groups have lobbied Congress to modify or repeal U.S. maritime laws so as to facilitate foreign flag competition. Foreign vessels generally have lower construction costs and generally operate at significantly lower costs than vessels in the U.S. markets, which would likely result in reduced charter rates. Rand believes that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal these laws. If these efforts are successful, it could result in significantly increased competition and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLower Lakes is subject to environmental laws that could require significant expenditures both to maintain compliance with such laws and to pay for any uninsured environmental liabilities resulting from a spill or other environmental disaster.\nOur shipping business and vessel operations are materially affected by environmental and other government regulations in the form of international conventions, United States and Canadian treaties, national, state, provincial, and local laws, and regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which vessels operate. Because such conventions, treaties, laws and regulations are often revised, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance or its impact on the resale price or useful life of our vessels. Additional conventions, treaties, laws and regulations may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost of doing business, which may materially adversely affect our operations, as well as the shipping industry generally. Lower\nLakes is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses, and certificates with respect to its operations and any increased cost in connection with obtaining such permits, licenses and certificates, or the imposition on Lower Lakes of the obligation to obtain additional permits, licenses and certificates, could adversely affect our results of operations. Lower Lakes currently maintains pollution liability coverage insurance. However, if the damages from a catastrophic incident exceed this insurance coverage, it could have a significant adverse impact on Rand's cash flow, profitability and financial position.\nThe operation of Lower Lakes' vessels is dependent on the price and availability of fuel. Continued periods of historically volatile fuel costs may materially adversely affect Rand's operating results.\nRand's operating results may be significantly impacted by changes in the availability or price of fuel for Lower Lakes' vessels. Fuel prices have varied significantly since 2004. Although fuel price surcharge/rebate clauses are included in substantially all of Lower Lakes' contracts of affreightment, which enable Lower Lakes to pass the majority of its increased and decreased fuel costs on to its customers, these measures may not be sufficient to enable Lower Lakes to fully recoup increased fuel costs or assure the continued availability of its fuel supplies. Although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of fuel, it is impossible to predict the price of fuel. Political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries (including, but not limited to, recent political unrest in the Middle East), changes in government policy, changes in fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future. There can be no assurance that Lower Lakes will be able to fully recover its increased fuel costs by passing these costs on to its customers. In the event that Lower Lakes is unable to do so, Rand's operating results will be adversely affected.\nGovernments could requisition Lower Lakes' vessels during a period of war or emergency, resulting in loss of revenues and earnings from such requisitioned vessels.\nThe United States or Canada could requisition title or seize Lower Lakes' vessels during a war or national emergency. Requisition of title occurs when a government takes a vessel and becomes the owner. A government could also requisition Lower Lakes vessels for hire, which would result in the government's taking control of a vessel and effectively becoming the charterer at a dictated charter rate. Requisition of one or more of Lower Lakes' vessels would have a substantial negative effect on Rand, as Rand would potentially lose all or substantially all revenues and earnings from the requisitioned vessels and/or permanently lose the vessels. Such losses might be partially offset if the requisitioning government compensated Rand for the requisition.\nThe operation of Great Lakes-going vessels entails the possibility of marine disasters including damage or destruction of the vessel due to accident, the loss of a vessel due to piracy or terrorism, damage or destruction of cargo and similar events that may cause a loss of revenue from affected vessels and damage Lower Lakes' business reputation, which may in turn lead to loss of business.\nThe operation of Great Lakes-going vessels entails certain inherent risks that may adversely affect Lower Lakes' business and reputation, including:\n\u25e6\ndamage or destruction of a vessel due to marine disaster such as a collision;\n\u25e6\nthe loss of a vessel due to piracy and terrorism;\n\u25e6\ncargo and property losses or damage as a result of the foregoing or less drastic causes such as human error, mechanical failure, low water levels and bad weather;\n\u25e6\nenvironmental accidents as a result of the foregoing; and\n\u25e6\nbusiness interruptions and delivery delays caused by mechanical failure, human error, war, terrorism, political action in various countries, labor strikes or adverse weather conditions.\nAny of these circumstances or events could substantially increase Lower Lakes' costs, as for example, the costs of replacing a vessel or cleaning up a spill, or lower its revenues by taking vessels out of operation permanently or for periods of time. The involvement of Lower Lakes' vessels in a disaster or delays in delivery or damages or loss of cargo may harm its reputation as a safe and reliable vessel operator and cause it to lose business.\nIf Lower Lakes' vessels suffer damage, they may need to be repaired at Lower Lakes' cost at a drydocking facility. The costs of drydock repairs are unpredictable and can be substantial. Lower Lakes may have to pay repair costs that insurance does not cover. The loss of earnings while these vessels are being repaired and repositioned, a risk that Lower Lakes does not maintain insurance to cover, as well as the actual cost of these repairs, could decrease its revenues and earnings substantially, particularly if a number of vessels are damaged or repaired at the same time.\nWe face periodic drydocking costs for our vessels, which can be substantial.\nVessels must be drydocked periodically for regulatory compliance and for maintenance and repair. Our drydocking requirements are subject to associated risks, including delay and cost overruns, lack of necessary equipment, unforeseen engineering problems, employee strikes or other work stoppages, unanticipated cost increases, inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals and shortages of materials or skilled labor. A significant delay in drydockings could have an adverse effect on our customer contract commitments. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial. Our insurance does not cover these costs.\nMaritime claimants could arrest Lower Lakes' vessels, which could interrupt its cash flow.\nCrew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo, and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages against such vessel. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of Lower Lakes' vessels could interrupt its cash flow and require it to pay large sums of funds to have the arrest lifted.", "PERMNO": 91905, "SIC": 4400, "TIC": "RLOGQ"}
