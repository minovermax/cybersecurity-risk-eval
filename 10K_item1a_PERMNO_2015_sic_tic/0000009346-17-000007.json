RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a description of the risk factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them before deciding to invest in, or retain, shares of the Company's common stock. These risk factors do not identify all risks that the Company faces; its operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial to its operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, the Company's past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n- 18 -\nWe compete with a large number of companies in the insurance industry for underwriting revenues.\nWe compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business. During periods of intense competition for premium, we are vulnerable to the actions of other companies who may seek to write business without the appropriate regard for ultimate profitability. During these times, it is very difficult to grow or maintain premium volume without sacrificing underwriting discipline and income.\nInsurance underwriting is highly competitive. We compete with other stock and mutual companies and inter-insurance exchanges (reciprocals). There are numerous insurance companies offering the lines of insurance which are currently written or may in the future be written by us. Many of these companies have been in business for longer periods of time, have significantly larger volumes of business, offer more diversified lines of insurance coverage and have significantly greater financial resources than us. In many cases, competitors are willing to provide coverage for rates lower than those charged by us. Many potential clients self-insure workers' compensation and other risks for which we offer coverage, and some have organized \"captive\" insurance companies as subsidiaries through which they insure their own operations. Some states have workers' compensation funds that preclude private companies from writing this business in those states. Federal law also authorizes the creation of \"Risk Retention Groups,\" which may write insurance coverages similar to those offered by us.\nWe may incur increased costs in competing for underwriting revenues. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate or to expand our operations into new markets, our underwriting revenues may decline, as well as our overall business results.\nNew competition could cause the supply and/or demand for insurance or reinsurance to change, which could affect our ability to price our coverages at attractive rates and thereby adversely affect our underwriting results.\nChanges in laws and regulations governing the insurance industry could have a negative impact on our ability to generate income from our insurance operations.\nOne or more of our Insurance Subsidiaries are regulated and licensed in all 50 of the United States, the District of Columbia, all Canadian provinces, Puerto Rico and Bermuda. We are obligated to comply with numerous complex and varied governmental regulations in order to maintain our authority to write insurance business. Failure to maintain compliance could result in governmental regulators preventing us from writing new business, which would have a material adverse impact on us, our results of operations and our financial condition. Further, the ability for our Insurance Subsidiaries to adjust insurance rates is regulated for significant portions of our business and needed rate adjustments can be denied or delayed for substantial periods by regulators.\nA material decline in our financial strength rating could adversely affect our position in the insurance market and cause a significant reduction in our premiums and earnings.\nOur main insurance subsidiary, Protective, currently has a financial strength rating of \"A+\" (Superior) by A.M. Best. Financial ratings are an important factor influencing the competitive position of insurance companies. A.M. Best ratings, which are commonly used in the insurance industry, currently range from \"A++\" (Superior) to \"F\" (In Liquidation). The objective of A.M. Best's rating system is to provide potential policyholders and other interested parties with an expert independent opinion of an insurer's financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations, including paying claims. This rating is subject to periodic review and may be revised downward, upward or revoked at the sole discretion of A.M. Best. A downgrade in rating could result in a loss of a number of insurance contracts we write and in a substantial loss of business to other competitors, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have two classes of common stock with unequal voting rights and are effectively controlled by our principal shareholders and management, which limits other shareholders' ability to influence our operations.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal shareholders and their affiliates control approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of voting Class A common stock and approximately 26% of the outstanding shares of non-voting Class B common stock. These parties effectively control us, direct our affairs, and exert significant influence in the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The interests of these shareholders may conflict with those of other shareholders, and this concentration of voting power may limit marketability of our stock and has the potential to delay, defer or prevent a change in control.\nWe are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.\nWe limit our risk of loss from policies of insurance issued by our Insurance Subsidiaries through the purchase of reinsurance coverage from other insurance companies. Such reinsurance does not relieve us of our responsibility to policyholders should the reinsurers be unable to meet their obligations to us under the terms of the underlying reinsurance agreements. While we have not experienced any significant reinsurance losses for over 25 years, a small number of our less significant historical reinsurance carriers have experienced deteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded by rating agencies, and provisions for potential uncollectible balances from these reinsurers have been established. If we are unable to collect the amounts due to us from reinsurers, any unreserved credit losses could adversely affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength.\n- 19 -\nWe may incur additional losses if our loss reserves are inadequate.\nA large portion of our provision for losses recorded is composed of estimates of future loss payments to be made. Such estimates of future loss payments may prove to be inadequate. Loss and loss expense reserves represent our best estimate at a given point in time but are not an exact calculation of ultimate liability. Rather, they are complex estimates derived by utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, inflation, claims handling, case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on our part. As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in so-called \"long tail\" lines where the adjudication of claims can take many years, management is sometimes required to revise reserves. This results in a charge to our earnings in the amount of the adjusted reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made. These charges can be substantial and can potentially have a material impact, either positively or negatively, on results of operations and shareholders' equity.\nThe loss of our major customer could severely impact our revenue and earnings potential and A.M. Best rating.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our direct premium volume from certain FedEx subsidiaries and related entities, and from insurance coverage provided to FedEx's contracted service providers. The loss of this major customer could materially adversely impact our revenue and earnings potential, as well as our A.M. Best rating.\nOur collateral held may prove to be insufficient.\nWe require collateral from our insureds covering the insureds' obligations for self-insured retentions or deductibles related to policies of insurance provided. Should we, as surety, become responsible for such insured obligations, the collateral held may prove to be insufficient. In this regard, FedEx utilizes significant self-insured retentions and deductibles under policies of insurance provided by us. In the case of FedEx, we have determined that the financial strength of the customer is sufficient to allow for holding only partial collateral at this time. Should we become responsible for this customer's entire self-insured retention and deductible obligations, the collateral held would be insufficient, and we would sustain a significant operating loss.\nA material drop in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our earnings and, potentially, our financial position.\nOur income from these investments could be materially reduced, and reduce our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength. The functioning of the fixed income markets, the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted by a change in interest rates or otherwise affected by significant negative factors, including, without limitation: local, national, or international events, such as regulatory changes, wars, or terrorist attacks; a recession, depression, or other adverse developments in either the U.S. or other economies that adversely affects the value of securities held in our portfolio; financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial instruments, which could further disrupt the markets; inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and impact our ability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired; a significant change in inflation expectations, or the onset of deflation or stagflation.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to market and credit risks, which could affect our financial results and ability to conduct business\nWe have a large portfolio of securities and limited partnership investments which can fluctuate in value with a wide variety of market conditions. A decline in the aggregate value of the securities and limited partnership investments would result in a commensurate decline in our shareholders' equity, either through the income statement or directly to equity. The resultant decline could, at least temporarily, materially adversely affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength ratings.\n- 20 -\nTechnological advances, including those specific to the transportation industry, could present us with added competitive risks.\nAn increase in accident prevention technologies and the growth of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles could reduce the amount of accidents over time and shift the liability from the owner of the vehicle to the manufacturer, which would cause automobile insurance to become a smaller portion of our overall property and casualty insurance book of business. Innovations in telematics and the increase in usage-based information have become more important and will likely change the way premiums are determined in the future. These advances in technology could materially change the way products in the transportation industry are designed, priced and underwritten, and it will take time for us to adjust to these changes.\nOur information technology systems and other operational systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond our control.\nWe rely upon our information technology systems and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of our data to run our businesses and service our customers. These information technology and other systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized tampering or other cyber security breaches, resulting in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to customers, or in theft of intellectual property or proprietary information. A failure to maintain proper security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems could delay or disrupt our ability to do business and service customers, harm our reputation, subject us to litigation, regulatory fines, a loss of customers and revenues or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur operations rely upon complex and expensive information technology systems for interacting with policyholders, brokers and employers. The pace at which information systems must be upgraded is continually increasing, requiring an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards. Our success may be impacted if we are not able to develop and expand the effectiveness of existing systems and to continue to enhance information systems that support our operations in a cost effective manner.\nChanges in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results.\nDevelopments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply with such developments, particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively. The impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income, net equity and other historical financial statement line items that are important to users of our financial statements. Changes could also introduce significant volatility in our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers, experienced underwriters, claims professionals and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our specialty lines of business. If we are unable to attract and retain such individuals, we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialty markets in which we operate and may be unable to expand our operations into new specialty markets.", "PERMNO": 16417, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "PTVCB"}
