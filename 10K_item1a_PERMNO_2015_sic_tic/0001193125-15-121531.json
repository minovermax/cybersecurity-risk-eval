{"cik": "1525769", "company": "Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe wish to caution you that our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors listed below are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this Report, and our other filings with the SEC, in our news releases, written or electronic communications, and verbal statements by our representatives.\nYou should be aware that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause our or our industry\u2019s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words like \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d and other similar expressions that convey uncertainty about future events or outcomes.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe economic uncertainty in the United States and Canada impacts our business and financial results and a renewed recession could materially affect us in the future.\nAny significant decrease in consumer confidence, or periods of economic slowdown or recession, could lead to a curtailing of discretionary spending, which in turn could reduce our revenues and results of operations and adversely affect our financial position. Our business is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending and therefore is affected by consumer confidence as well as the future performance of the United States and global economies. As a result, our results of operations are susceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions. Increases in job losses, home foreclosures, investment losses in the financial markets, personal bankruptcies, credit card debt and home mortgage and other borrowing costs, declines in housing values and reduced access to credit, amongst other factors, may result in lower levels of customer traffic in our stores, a decline in consumer confidence and a curtailing of consumer discretionary spending. We believe that consumers generally are more willing to make discretionary purchases during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. If economic conditions worsen, whether in the United States or in the communities in which our stores are located, we could see deterioration in customer traffic or a reduction in the average amount customers spend in our stores. A reduction in revenues will result in sales de-leveraging (spreading our fixed costs across the lower level of sales) and will in turn cause downward pressure on our profit margins. This could result in reduction of staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential store closures, a deceleration of new store openings and an inability to comply with the covenants under our senior secured credit facility.\nFuture economic downturns similar to the economic crisis that began in 2008 could have a material adverse impact on our landlords or other tenants in shopping centers in which we are located, which in turn could negatively affect our financial results.\nIf we experience another economic downturn in the future, our landlords may be unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, resulting in failures to pay required tenant improvement allowances or satisfy other lease covenants to us. In addition, tenants at shopping centers in which we are located or have executed leases, or to which our locations are near, may fail to open or may cease operations. Decreases in total tenant occupancy in shopping centers in which we are located, or to which our locations are near, may affect traffic at our stores. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nOur growth strategy depends on our ability to open new stores and operate them profitably.\nAs of February 1, 2015, there were 73 stores open in the United States and Canada. A key element of our growth strategy is to open additional stores in locations that we believe will provide attractive returns on investment. We have identified a number of additional sites for potential future Dave & Buster\u2019s stores. Our ability to open new stores on a timely and cost-effective basis, or at all, is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nfind quality locations;\n\u2022\nreach acceptable agreements regarding the lease or purchase of locations;\n\u2022\ncomply with applicable zoning, licensing, land use and environmental regulations;\n\u2022\nraise or have available an adequate amount of cash or currently available financing for construction and opening costs;\n\u2022\ntimely hire, train and retain the skilled management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs;\n\u2022\nobtain, for acceptable cost, required permits and approvals, including liquor licenses; and\n\u2022\nefficiently manage the amount of time and money used to build and open each new store.\nIf we succeed in opening new stores on a timely and cost-effective basis, we may nonetheless be unable to attract enough customers to new stores because potential customers may be unfamiliar with our stores or concept, or our entertainment and menu options might not appeal to them. Our new large and small format stores may not meet or exceed the performance of our existing stores or meet or exceed our performance targets, including target cash-on-cash returns. New stores may even operate at a loss, which could have a significant adverse effect on our overall operating results. If the expected future cash flows for a store are less than the asset carrying amount (an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable), we may recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess of the asset carrying amount over the fair value. Opening a new store in an existing market could reduce the revenue at our existing stores in that market. In addition, historically, new stores experience a drop in revenues after their first year of operation. Typically, this drop has been temporary and has been followed by increases in revenue in line with the rest of our comparable store base, but there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future or that a new store will succeed in the long term.\nOur expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with the area.\nSome of our new stores will be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful experience. Those markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause our new stores to be less successful than stores in our existing markets. In addition, our national advertising program may not be successful in generating brand awareness in all local markets, and the lack of market awareness of the Dave & Buster\u2019s brand can pose an additional risk in expanding into new markets. Stores opened in new markets may open at lower average weekly revenues than stores opened in existing markets, and may have higher store-level operating expense ratios than stores in existing markets. Sales at stores opened in new markets may take longer to reach average store revenues, if at all, thereby adversely affecting our overall profitability.\nIn addition, we may in the future establish stores outside of the United States and Canada. In addition to the risks posed by new markets generally, the operating conditions in overseas markets may vary significantly from those we have experienced in the past, including in relation to consumer preferences, regulatory environment, currency risk, the presence and cooperation of suitable local partners and availability of vendors or commercial and physical infrastructure, among others. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these new stores into our operations, achieving market acceptance, operating these stores profitably, and maintaining compliance with the rapidly changing business and regulatory requirements of new markets. If we are unable to do so, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to compete favorably in the highly competitive out-of-home and home-based entertainment and restaurant markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe out-of-home entertainment market is highly competitive. We compete for customers\u2019 discretionary entertainment dollars with theme parks, as well as with providers of out-of-home entertainment, including localized attraction facilities such as movie theatres, sporting events, bowling alleys, nightclubs and restaurants. Many of the entities operating these businesses are larger and have significantly greater financial resources, a greater number of stores, have been in business longer, have greater name recognition and are better established in the markets where our stores are located or are planned to be located. As a result, they may be able to invest greater resources than we can in attracting customers and succeed in attracting customers who would otherwise come to our stores. The legalization of casino gambling in geographic areas near any current or future store would create the possibility for entertainment alternatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We also face competition from local establishments that offer entertainment experiences similar to ours and restaurants that are highly competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambience and type and quality of food. We also face competition from increasingly sophisticated home-based forms of entertainment, such as internet and video gaming and home movie delivery. Our failure to compete favorably in the competitive out-of-home and home-based entertainment and restaurant markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur quarterly results of operations are subject to fluctuations due to the seasonality of our business and other events.\nOur operating results fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonal factors. Typically, we have higher first and fourth quarter revenues associated with the spring and year-end holidays. Our third quarter, which encompasses the back-to-school fall season, has historically had lower revenues as compared to the other quarters. We expect seasonality will continue to be a factor in our results of operations. As a result, factors affecting peak seasons could have a disproportionate effect on our results. For example, the number of days between Thanksgiving and New Year\u2019s Day and the days of the week on which Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve fall affect the volume of business we generate during the December holiday season and can affect our results for the full fiscal year. In addition, adverse weather during the winter and spring seasons can have a significant impact on our first and fourth quarters, and therefore our results for the full fiscal year.\nOur operating results may also fluctuate significantly because of non-seasonal factors. Due to our relatively limited number of locations, poor results of operations at any single store could materially affect our overall profitability.\nOur quarterly results of operations are subject to fluctuations due to the timing of new store openings.\nThe timing of new store openings may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly performance. We typically incur most cash pre-opening costs for a new store within the two months immediately preceding, and the month of, the store\u2019s opening. In addition, the labor and operating costs for a newly opened store during the first three to six months of operation are materially greater than what can be expected after that time, both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues. We expect to spend approximately $92,000 to $102,000 ($67,000 to $77,000 net of tenant improvement allowances from landlords) for new store construction in fiscal 2015. A portion of the fiscal 2015 new store spend is related to stores that will be under construction in fiscal 2015 and are not expected to open until fiscal 2016. Due to these substantial up-front financial requirements to open new stores, the investment risk related to any single store is much larger than that associated with many other restaurants or entertainment venues.\nWe may not be able to maintain profitability.\nMaintaining profitability depends upon numerous factors, including our ability to generate increased revenues and our ability to control expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this Report and our ongoing depreciation and amortization expense, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events. Accordingly, we can make no assurances that we will be able to achieve, sustain or increase profitability in the future. Failure to achieve and maintain profitability could have an adverse impact on the trading prices of our common stock.\nOur operations are susceptible to the availability and cost of food and other supplies, in most cases from a limited number of suppliers, which subject us to possible risks of shortages, interruptions and price fluctuations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in product costs. Cost of food as a percentage of total revenue was 8.6% in fiscal 2014. Cost of amusement and other costs as a percentage of total revenue was 7.3% in fiscal 2014. If we have to pay higher prices for food or other supplies, our operating costs may increase, and, if we are unable or unwilling to pass such cost increases on to our customers, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe unplanned loss of a major distributor could adversely affect our business by disrupting our operations as we seek out and negotiate a new distribution contract. We also have multiple short-term supply contracts with a limited number of suppliers. If any of these suppliers do not perform adequately or otherwise fail to distribute products or supplies to our stores, we may be unable to replace the suppliers in a short period of time on acceptable terms, which could increase our costs, cause shortages of food and other items at our stores and cause us to remove certain items from our menu. Other than forward purchase contracts for certain food items, we currently do not engage in futures contracts or other financial risk management strategies with respect to potential price fluctuations in the cost of food and other supplies.\nWe may not be able to anticipate and react to changing food, beverage and amusement costs by adjusting purchasing practices or menu and game prices, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur procurement of games and amusement offerings is dependent upon a few suppliers.\nOur ability to continue to procure new games, amusement offerings, and other entertainment-related equipment is important to our business strategy. The number of suppliers from which we can purchase games, amusement offerings and other entertainment-related equipment is limited. To the extent that the number of suppliers declines, we could be subject to the risk of distribution delays, pricing pressure, lack of innovation and other associated risks.\nIn addition, any increase in cost or decrease in availability of new amusement offerings that appeal to customers could adversely impact the cost to acquire and operate new amusements which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We may not be able to anticipate and react to changing amusement offerings cost by adjusting purchasing practices or game prices, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nInstances of foodborne illness and outbreaks of disease, as well as negative publicity relating thereto, could result in reduced demand for our menu offerings and reduced traffic in our stores and negatively impact our business.\nWe cannot guarantee that our supply chain and food safety controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all food safety issues at our stores, including any occurrences of foodborne illnesses such as salmonella, E. coli and hepatitis A. In addition, we rely on third-party vendors, making it difficult to monitor food safety compliance and increasing the risk that foodborne illness would affect multiple locations rather than a single store. Some foodborne illness incidents could be caused by third-party vendors and distributors outside of our control. New illnesses resistant to our current precautions may develop in the future, or diseases with long incubation periods could arise, that could give rise to claims or allegations on a retroactive basis. One or more instances of foodborne illness in any of our stores or markets or related to food products we sell could negatively affect our store sales nationwide if highly publicized on national media outlets or through social media. This risk exists even if it were later determined that the illness was wrongly attributed to us or one of our stores. A number of restaurant chains have experienced incidents related to foodborne illnesses that have had a material adverse effect on their operations. The occurrence of a similar incident at one or more of our stores, or negative publicity or public speculation about an incident, could reduce customer visits to our stores and negatively impact demand for our menu offerings.\nWe may not be able to operate our stores, or obtain and maintain licenses and permits necessary for such operation, in compliance with laws, regulations and other requirements, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Each store is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which may include alcoholic beverage control, amusement, health and safety and fire agencies in the state, county or municipality in which the store is located. Each store is required to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises from a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. In the past, we have had licenses temporarily suspended. The most recent example is our license to sell alcoholic beverages was suspended for two days in 2011 in our Maple Grove, Minnesota store, due to violations of the terms of our licenses. In some states, the loss of a license for cause with respect to one location may lead to the loss of licenses at all locations in that state and could make it more difficult to obtain additional licenses in that state. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of each store, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. The failure to receive or retain a liquor license, or any other required permit or license, in a particular location, or to continue to qualify for, or renew licenses, could have a material adverse effect on operations and our ability to obtain such a license or permit in other locations.\nAs a result of operating certain entertainment games and attractions, including skill-based games that offer redemption prizes, we are subject to amusement licensing and regulation by the states, counties and municipalities in which our stores are located. These laws and regulations can vary significantly by state, county, and municipality and, in some jurisdictions, may require us to modify our business operations or alter the mix of redemption games and simulators we offer. Moreover, as more states and local communities implement legalized gambling, the laws and corresponding enabling regulations may also be applicable to our redemption games and regulators may create new licensing requirements, taxes or fees, or restrictions on the various types of redemption games we offer. For example, the State of Florida has adopted a more restrictive definition of legal redemption games. Furthermore, the states of Ohio (broad regulation of games of skill) and Maryland (regulation of electronic gaming devices), and the city of Honolulu, Hawaii (regulation of simulated gambling devices), are considering changes to existing laws to further regulate legalized gaming and illegal gambling. Adoption of these laws, or adverse interpretation of existing laws, could require our existing stores in these jurisdictions to alter the mix of games, modify certain games, limit the number of tickets that may be won by a customer from a redemption game, change the mix of prizes that we may offer at our Winner\u2019s Circle or terminate the use of specific games, any of which could adversely affect our operations. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we may be subject to various sanctions and/or penalties and fines or may be required to cease operations until we achieve compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial results.\nChanges in laws, regulations and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are also subject to federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and other requirements. More stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new stores in particular locations. Environmental laws and regulations also govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water as well as the presence, handling, release and disposal of and exposure to hazardous substances. These laws provide for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance. Third parties may also make personal injury, property damage or other claims against us associated with actual or alleged release of, or exposure to, hazardous substances at our properties. We could also be strictly liable, without regard to fault, for certain environmental conditions at properties we formerly owned or operated as well as at our current properties.\nIn addition, we are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages and overtime), the Americans with Disabilities Act, various family-leave mandates and other federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern working conditions. From time-to-time, the U.S. Congress and the states consider increases in the applicable minimum wage. Several states in which we operate have enacted increases in the minimum wage, which have taken effect during the past several years, and further increases are anticipated. We expect increases in payroll expenses as a result of federal and state mandated increases in the minimum wage. In general, we have been able to substantially offset cost increases resulting from changes in minimum wage rates by increasing menu prices, improving productivity, or through other adjustments. However, we are uncertain of the repercussions, if any, of increased minimum wages on other expenses. For example, our suppliers may be more severely impacted by higher minimum wage standards, which could result in increased costs to us. If we are unable to offset these costs through increased costs to our customers, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Moreover, although none of our employees have been or are now represented by any unions, labor organizations may seek to represent certain of our employees in the future, and if they are successful, our payroll expenses and other labor costs may be increased in the course of collective bargaining, and/or there may be strikes or other work disruptions that may adversely affect our business.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d), as well as other healthcare reform legislation being considered by Congress and state legislatures, may have an adverse effect on our business. Although the Affordable Care Act does not mandate that employers offer health insurance to all employees who are eligible under the legislation, beginning in 2015, penalties will be assessed on employers who do not offer health insurance that meets certain affordability or benefit coverage requirements. Providing health insurance benefits to employees that are more extensive than the health insurance benefits we currently provide and to a potentially larger proportion of our employees, or the payment of penalties if the specified level of coverage is not provided at an affordable cost to employees, will increase our expenses. Additionally, our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher health care-related costs, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us. We believe our plans meet these requirements, however, providing health insurance benefits to a potentially larger proportion of our employees, or the payment of penalties if the specified level of coverage is not provided at an affordable cost to employees, could have a significant, negative impact on our business.\nThe Affordable Care Act also requires us to comply with federal nutritional disclosure requirements. The Food and Drug Administration has recently finalized regulations to implement the nutritional menu labeling provisions of the Affordable Care Act. These final regulations will be effective on December 1, 2015 and establish a uniform, federal requirement for certain restaurants, including ours, to post certain nutritional information on their menus. We will be required to publish the total number of calories of standard menu items on menus, along with a statement that puts this calorie information in the context of a total daily calorie intake. The Affordable Care Act also requires us to provide to consumers, upon request, a written summary of detailed nutritional information for each standard menu item, and to provide a statement on menus about the availability of this information. The Affordable Care Act also permits the Food and Drug Administration to require us to make additional nutrient disclosures, such as disclosure of trans-fat content. An unfavorable report on, or reaction to, our menu ingredients, the size of our portions, or the nutritional content of our menu items could negatively influence the demand for our offerings. We cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or our ability to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu offerings to trends and eating habits. The imposition of menu-labeling laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as the hospitality industry in general.\nOur sales and results of operations may be adversely affected by climate change and the passage of other environmental legislation and regulations. The costs and other effects of new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. For example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent that such requirements increase prices charged to us by vendors because of increased compliance costs. At this point, we are unable to determine the impact that climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations could have on our overall business.\nWe face potential liability with our gift cards under the property laws of some states.\nOur gift cards, which may be used to purchase food, beverages, merchandise and game play credits in our stores, may be considered stored value cards. Certain states include gift cards under their abandoned and unclaimed property laws, and require companies to remit to the state cash in an amount equal to all or a designated portion of the unredeemed balance on the gift cards based on certain card attributes and the length of time that the cards are inactive. To date we have not remitted any amounts relating to unredeemed gift cards to states based upon our assessment of applicable laws. We recognize income from unredeemed cards when we determine that the likelihood of the cards being redeemed is remote and that recognition is appropriate based on governing state statutes.\nThe analysis of the potential application of the abandoned and unclaimed property laws to our gift cards is complex, involving an analysis of constitutional, statutory provisions and factual issues. In the event that one or more states change their existing abandoned and unclaimed property laws or successfully challenge our position on the application of its abandoned and unclaimed property laws to our gift cards, or if the estimates that we use in projecting the likelihood of the cards being redeemed prove to be inaccurate, our liabilities with respect to unredeemed gift cards may be materially higher than the amounts shown in our financial statements. If we are required to materially increase the estimated liability recorded in our financial statements with respect to unredeemed gift cards, our net income could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Power Cards may raise similar concerns to gift cards in terms of the applicability of states\u2019 abandoned and unclaimed property laws. However, based on our analysis of abandoned and unclaimed property laws, we believe that our Power Cards are not stored value cards and such laws do not apply, although there can be no assurance that states will not take a different position.\nCustomer complaints or litigation on behalf of our customers or employees may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely affected by legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of our customers or employees. In recent years, a number of restaurant companies, including ours, have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, and a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. We could also face potential liability if we are found to have misclassified certain employees as exempt from the overtime requirements of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and state labor laws. We have had from time to time and now have such lawsuits pending against us. In addition, from time to time, customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a store. We are also subject to a variety of other claims in the ordinary course of business, including personal injury, lease and contract claims. The restaurant industry has also been subject to a growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers.\nWe are also subject to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes in certain states in which our stores are located. These statutes generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated individual. We are currently the subject of one lawsuit that alleges a violation of these statutes. Recent litigation against restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments and settlements under dram shop statutes. Because these cases often seek punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance, such litigation could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from operations and hurt our financial performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage or not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. As approximately 32.4% of our food and beverage revenues were derived from the sale of alcoholic beverages during fiscal 2014, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may materially affect our stores and us.\nWe may face labor shortages that could slow our growth and adversely impact our ability to operate our stores.\nThe successful operation of our business depends upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified executives, managers and skilled employees. From time-to-time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor in certain of the communities in which our stores are located. Shortages of skilled labor may make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract, train and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees and could delay the planned openings of new stores or adversely impact our existing stores. Any such delays, material increases in employee turnover rates in existing stores or widespread employee dissatisfaction could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nImmigration reform continues to attract significant attention in the public arena and the U.S. Congress. If new immigration legislation is enacted, such laws may contain provisions that could increase our costs in recruiting, training and retaining employees. Also, although our hiring practices comply with the requirements of federal law in reviewing employees\u2019 citizenship or authority to work in the United States, increased enforcement efforts with respect to existing immigration laws by governmental authorities may disrupt a portion of our workforce or our operations at one or more of our stores, thereby negatively impacting our business.\nWe depend on the services of key executives, the loss of whom could materially harm our business and our strategic direction if we were unable to replace them with executives of equal experience and capabilities.\nOur future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. With the exception of Kevin Bachus, Senior Vice President of Entertainment and Game Strategy, we have employment agreements with all members of senior management. However, we cannot prevent members of senior management from terminating their employment with us. Losing the services of members of senior management could materially harm our business until a suitable replacement is found, and such replacement may not have equal experience and capabilities. In addition, we have not purchased life insurance on any members of our senior management.\nLocal conditions, events, terrorist attacks, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our business.\nCertain of the regions in which our stores are located have been, and may in the future be, subject to adverse local conditions, events, terrorist attacks, adverse weather conditions, or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes. For example, nine of our stores are located in California and are particularly subject to earthquake risk, and our five stores in Florida, our two stores in Houston, Texas and our one store in Hawaii are particularly subject to hurricane risk. Depending upon its magnitude, a natural disaster could severely damage our stores, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We currently maintain property and business interruption insurance through the aggregate property policy for each of the stores. However, such coverage may not be sufficient if there is a major disaster. In addition, upon the expiration of our current insurance policies, adequate insurance coverage may not be available at reasonable rates, or at all.\nDamage to our brand or reputation could adversely affect our business.\nOur brand and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends, in part, upon the external perception of our Company, the quality of our food service and facilities and our integrity. Multi-store businesses, such as ours, can be adversely affected by unfavorable publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness or health concerns, or a variety of other operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of stores. Adverse publicity involving any of these factors could make our stores less appealing, reduce our customer traffic and/or impose practical limits on pricing. In the future, our stores may be operated by franchisees. Any such franchisees will be independent third parties that we do not control. Although our franchisees will be contractually obligated to operate the store in accordance with our standards, we would not oversee their daily operations. If one or more of our stores were the subject of unfavorable publicity, our overall brand could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to renew real property leases on favorable terms, or at all, which may require us to close a store or relocate, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAll 73 stores operated by us as of February 1, 2015 are operated on leased property. The leases typically provide for a base rent plus additional rent based on a percentage of the revenue generated by the stores on the leased premises once certain thresholds are met. A decision not to renew a lease for a store could be based on a number of factors, including an assessment of the area in which the store is located. We may choose not to renew, or may not be able to renew, certain of such existing leases if the capital investment then required to maintain the stores at the leased locations is not justified by the return on the required investment. If we are not able to renew the leases at rents that allow such stores to remain profitable as their terms expire, the number of such stores may decrease, resulting in lower revenue from operations, or we may relocate a store, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks, and, in either case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, our store lease on our Farmingdale location did not contain an option to renew and the lease expired in February 2015, resulting in the store\u2019s closure on February 8, 2015.\nFixed rental payments account for a significant portion of our operating expenses, which increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and could limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nPayments under our operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. For example, total rental payments, including additional rental payments based on sales at some of our stores, under operating leases were approximately $62,030, or 8.3% of our total revenues, in fiscal 2014. In addition, as of February 1, 2015, we were a party to operating leases requiring future minimum lease payments aggregating approximately $125,424 through the next two years and approximately $536,636 thereafter. We expect that we will lease any new stores we open under operating leases. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our available cash to be applied to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage with respect to our competitors.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease obligations and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under bank loans or from other sources, we may not be able to service our operating lease obligations, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property.\nOur intellectual property is essential to our success and competitive position. We use a combination of intellectual property rights, such as trademarks and trade secrets, to protect our brand and certain other proprietary processes and information material to our business. The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our intellectual property rights to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, we may lose an important advantage in the markets in which we compete. If third parties misappropriate or infringe our intellectual property, the value of our image, brand and the goodwill associated therewith may be diminished, our brand may fail to achieve and maintain market recognition, and our competitive position may be harmed, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our revenues. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the violation or misappropriation of such intellectual property rights by others. To protect our intellectual property, we may become involved in litigation, which could result in substantial expenses, divert the attention of management and adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be certain that our products and services do not and will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle, divert the attention of management, cause significant delays, materially disrupt the conduct of our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As a consequence of such claims, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award, take a royalty-bearing license, discontinue the use of third-party products used within our operations and/or rebrand our business and products.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls, our business and operating results could be harmed. Any failure to remediate deficiencies noted by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm or to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nDisruptions in our information technology systems or security breaches of confidential customer information or personal employee information could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nOur operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including the point-of-sale, kiosk and amusement operations systems in our stores, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various other software applications used throughout our operations. Disruptions in these systems could have an adverse impact on our operations. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulty could lead to significant expenses or to losses due to disruption in our business operations.\nIn addition, our information technology systems are subject to the risk of infiltration or data theft. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage information technology systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. As such, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. The hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may also contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other methods of deceiving our team members, contractors and temporary staff. In 2007, there was an external breach of our credit card processing systems, which led to fraudulent credit card activity and resulted in the payment of fines and reimbursements for the fraudulent credit card activity. As part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, we have implemented a series of corrective measures in order to ensure that our computer systems are secure and that our customers\u2019 personal information is protected. Despite our considerable efforts and investment in technology to secure our computer network, security could still be compromised, confidential information could be misappropriated or system disruptions could occur in the future. This could cause significant harm to our reputation, lead to a loss of sales or profits or cause us to incur significant costs to reimburse third parties for damages.\nOur current insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims and we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance.\nWe believe we maintain insurance coverage that is customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not commercially reasonable to insure. For example, we maintain business interruption insurance, but there can be no assurance that the coverage for a severe or prolonged business interruption at one or more of our stores would be adequate. Given the limited number of stores we operate, such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Similarly, although we carry insurance for breaches of our computer network security, there can be no assurance that all types of potential loss or liability will be covered by such insurance or that we have enough insurance to provide coverage against all claims. Moreover, we believe that insurance covering liability for violations of wage and hour laws is generally not available. These losses, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our financial obligations.\nAs of February 1, 2015, we had $430,000 ($429,020 net of discount) of borrowings under our term loan facility, no borrowings under our revolving credit facility and $5,822 in letters of credit outstanding. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to further refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we will be able to do any of this on a timely basis or on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, new store growth and general corporate or other purposes may be limited;\n\u2022\na portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on the indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nour senior secured credit facility has a variable rate of interest, exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates;\n\u2022\nour ability to adjust to changing market conditions may be limited and may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nwe may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in business, or may be unable to carry on capital spending that is important to our growth.\nThe terms of our new senior secured credit facility restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our operations.\nOur new senior secured credit facility contains, and any future indebtedness will likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nengage in sales of assets and subsidiary stock;\n\u2022\nenter into sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ntransfer all or substantially all of our assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions;\n\u2022\nhedge currency and interest rate risk; and\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures.\nOur new senior secured credit facility requires us to meet a maximum total leverage ratio if outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit (other than letters of credit that have been backstopped or cash collateralized) are in excess of 30% of the outstanding revolving commitments. Failure by us to comply with the covenants or financial ratios contained in the instruments governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under the facility, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations. In the event of any default under our senior secured credit facility, the lenders will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us. Our lenders also could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable and require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these amounts. If our indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full.\nOur principal stockholder has substantial control over us.\nAs of February 1, 2015, the Oak Hill Funds collectively beneficially own approximately 62.1% of our outstanding common stock. As a consequence, the Oak Hill Funds or their affiliates are able to control matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and any other significant transaction. The interests of this stockholder may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. For instance, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price.\nAs a result of affiliates of the Oak Hill Funds controlling a majority of our outstanding common stock, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ corporate governance standards. Under these rules, a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d may elect not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance standards, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of the Board of Directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee.\nWe currently utilize certain of these exemptions and may elect to utilize others in the future. As a result, we may not have a majority of independent directors, our nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee may not consist entirely of independent directors and such committees will not be subject to annual performance evaluations. Accordingly, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.\nIn addition, so long as the Oak Hill Funds (or one or more of their affiliates to the extent assigned thereto) own at least 40% of our outstanding common stock, stockholders will be able to take action by written consent. During such time, affiliates of the Oak Hill Funds, along with a limited number of other stockholders (if the Oak Hill Funds hold less than a majority of our outstanding common stock), could take action by written consent and prevent other stockholders the opportunity to attend a meeting of stockholders and vote on a particular matter.\nSo long as the Oak Hill Funds (or one or more of their affiliates, to the extent assigned thereto or any person that acquires at least 10% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of our common stock from the Oak Hill Funds in a privately negotiated transaction (an \u201cOak Hill Transferee\u201d), as applicable) own 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the Oak Hill Funds or an Oak Hill Transferee, as applicable, will have the right to call a special meeting of our stockholders.\nUnder the stockholders agreement, the Oak Hill Funds have consent rights with respect to the following matters so long as the Oak Hill Funds (or one or more of their affiliates, to the extent assigned thereto) own 25% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock: declaration or payments of non-pro rata dividends or non-pro rata repurchases of our common stock or amendments to our organizational documents in a manner adverse to the Oak Hill Funds.\nThe Oak Hill Funds and their affiliates will be reimbursed for certain costs and expenses pursuant to the stockholders\u2019 agreement.\nConflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are principals of our principal stockholder.\nThe Oak Hill Funds or their affiliates could invest in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us. As a result of these relationships, when conflicts arise between the interests of the Oak Hill Funds or their affiliates and the interests of our stockholders, these directors may not be disinterested. The representatives of the Oak Hill Funds on our Board of Directors, by the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and stockholders\u2019 agreement, are not required to offer us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as our directors. In addition, under the stockholders\u2019 agreement, the Oak Hill Funds are granted access to our customary non-public information, and members of our management team and the Oak Hill Funds are permitted to disclose our confidential information to their affiliates, representatives and advisors and the Oak Hill Funds and their affiliates will be permitted to disclose our confidential information if requested or required by law. The Oak Hill Funds and their affiliates are also permitted to disclose our confidential information to any potential purchaser of D&B Entertainment that executes a customary confidentiality agreement.\nThe Oak Hill Funds are entitled to designate directors to serve on the Board of Directors proportionate to the Oak Hill Funds\u2019 (or one or more of their affiliates, to the extent assigned thereto) aggregate ownership of the outstanding shares of our common stock, at any meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected to the extent that the Oak Hill Funds do not have such proportionate number of director designees then serving on the Board of Directors; provided that for so long as the Oak Hill Funds (or one or more of their affiliates, to the extent assigned thereto), individually or in the aggregate, own 5% or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the Oak Hill Funds are entitled to designate one director designee to serve on the Board of Directors at any meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected to the extent that the Oak Hill Funds do not have a director designee then serving on the Board of Directors. Such proportionate number of director designees is determined by taking the product of the Oak Hill Funds\u2019 (or one or more of their affiliates, to the extent assigned thereto) aggregate ownership interest in our Company multiplied by the then current number of directors on our Board of Directors (rounded up to the next whole number to the extent the product does not equal a whole number). Subject to applicable law and applicable NASDAQ rules, the stockholders\u2019 agreement also provides that the Oak Hill Funds are entitled to nominate the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee up to a number of nominees not to exceed the number of directors designated by the Oak Hill Funds on the Board of Directors, and the remaining members are to be nominated by the Board of Directors. For so long as the Oak Hill Funds (or one or more of their affiliates, to the extent assigned thereto) own 20% or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall consist of no more than three members. In addition, subject to applicable law and applicable NASDAQ rules, each other committee of our Board of Directors, other than the Audit Committee, consists of at least one member designated by the Oak Hill Funds.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the offering price.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the broader stock market;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated strategic, technological or regulatory threats, whether or not warranted by actual events;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of our Company or the media and entertainment industries;\n\u2022\nsales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel, creative or other talent;\n\u2022\nregulatory or political developments;\n\u2022\nlitigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that in some cases has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders were to bring a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business.\nYou may be diluted by the future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise.\nAs of February 1, 2015, we had 400,000,000 shares of common stock authorized but unissued. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue these shares of common stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. Subsequent to the exercise of 300,151 options sold as part of the February 5, 2014 follow-on offering, we have reserved 3,693,897 shares for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options under our 2010 Stock Incentive Plan and 3,100,000 for issuances under our 2014 Stock Incentive Plan. Any common stock that we issue, including under our 2014 Stock Incentive Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, as well as under outstanding options would dilute the percentage ownership held by current stockholders.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could reduce the price of our common stock and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.\nIf our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market following this offering, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could also depress our market price. As of February 1, 2015, we had 39,969,228 shares of common stock outstanding. We, our directors and our executive officers and our significant stockholders are subject to certain restrictions on resale. Following the expiration of the resale restrictions, our principal stockholders will have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of our common stock under the Securities Act. The market price of shares of our common stock may drop significantly when the restrictions on resale by our existing stockholders lapse or when we are required to register the sale of our stockholders\u2019 remaining shares of our common stock. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. We intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and the repayment of outstanding debt. Our senior secured credit facility contains, and any future indebtedness likely will contain, restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and make other restricted payments. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be your major source of gain for the foreseeable future. While we may change this policy at some point in the future, we cannot assure you that we will make such a change. See \u201cItem 5 - Market For Registrant\u2019s Common Equity Related Stockholder Matters And Issurer Purchase of Equity Securities-Dividend Policy\u201d.\nWe are a holding company with no operations, and we rely on our operating subsidiary to provide us with the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends.\nWe are a holding company with no material direct operations. Our principal assets are equity interests that we indirectly hold in our operating subsidiary, D&B Inc, which owns our operating assets. As a result, we are dependent on loans, dividends, and other payments from D&B Inc to generate funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. Although we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, if we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiary, we may be unable to, or our board may exercise its discretion not to, pay dividends.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and elect to comply with certain reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even though we currently only avail ourselves of the reduced disclosure obligations with respect to executive compensation, we may avail ourselves of additional reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we are choosing to opt out of any extended transition period, and as a result we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non- emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years following our IPO, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700,000 as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.\nOur costs could increase significantly as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to complying with public company regulations.\nAs a public company and particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d (to the extent that we have taken advantage of certain exceptions from reporting requirements that are available under the JOBS Act as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d), we could incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses not incurred in previous years. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), as well as rules promulgated by the SEC and NASDAQ, require us to adopt corporate governance practices applicable to U.S. public companies. These rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs.\nSarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ, have imposed increased disclosure and enhanced corporate governance practices for public companies. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, and our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to result in increased expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. We may not be successful in continuing to implement these requirements and implementing them could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we fail to implement the requirements with respect to our internal accounting and audit functions, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis could be impaired.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of Sarbanes- Oxley could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe are required to comply with certain SEC rules that implement Sections 302 and 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, which will require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Though we are required to disclose changes made in our internal control procedures on a quarterly basis, if we take advantage of certain exceptions from reporting requirements that are available to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d under the JOBS Act, each independent registered public accounting firm that performs an audit for us will not be required to attest to and report on our annual assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event they are not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, may depress the trading price of our stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include certain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company or changes in our management, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of our stockholders to fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nour ability to issue preferred stock with terms that the Board of Directors may determine, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders other than the Oak Hill Funds to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only upon the request of a majority of our Board of Directors or our Chief Executive Officer or at the request of the Oak Hill Funds or an Oak Hill Transferee, as long as the Oak Hill Funds (or one or more of their affiliates to the extent assigned thereto, or an Oak Hill Transferee, as applicable) owns at least 10% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nour directors may only be removed from the Board of Directors for cause by the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the remaining members of the Board of Directors or (ii) the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon;\n\u2022\nthe absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors, which may limit the ability of minority stockholders to elect directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from soliciting proxies to elect a particular slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nThese provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change of control of our Company that is in the best interest of our minority stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may affect the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations, including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is defined to include persons owning directly or indirectly 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation. Accordingly, Section 203 could have an anti-takeover effect with respect to certain transactions that the Board of Directors does not approve in advance. The provisions of Section 203 may encourage companies interested in acquiring the Company to negotiate in advance with the Board of Directors because the stockholder approval requirement would be avoided if the Board of Directors approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder.\nHowever, Section 203 also could discourage attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders. These provisions also may make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will not be governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will contain a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner, including if Board of Directors approval or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the business combination, except that they will provide that the Oak Hill Funds, or any affiliate thereof or any person or entity which acquires from any of the foregoing stockholders beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the then outstanding shares of our voting stock in a transaction or any person or entity which acquires from such transferee beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the then outstanding shares of our voting stock other than through a registered public offering or through any broker\u2019s transaction executed on any securities exchange or other over-the-counter market, shall not be deemed an interested stockholder for purposes of this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and therefore not subject to the restrictions set forth in this provision.", "PERMNO": 81695, "SIC": 5810, "TIC": "PLAY"}
