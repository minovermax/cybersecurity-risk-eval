Our restaurants cater to both business and social guests. Accordingly, our business is susceptible to economic factors that may result in reduced discretionary spending by our clientele. We also believe that consumers generally tend to make fewer discretionary expenditures, including for high-end restaurant meals, during periods of actual or perceived negative economic conditions. Changes in spending habits as a result of an economic slowdown, inflation or lower consumer confidence are likely to decrease the number of restaurant guests and average revenue per guest and put pressure on pricing, which would adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nThe US, Brazil or the specific markets in which we operate may suffer from depressed economic activity, recessionary economic cycles, higher fuel or energy costs, low consumer confidence, high levels of unemployment, reduced home values, increases in home foreclosures, investment losses, personal bankruptcies, reduced access to credit or other economic factors that may affect consumer discretionary spending. During the economic crisis and recession from late 2007 to mid-2009, our business was materially adversely affected by a significant decrease in revenues from our restaurants in the US and Brazil due to adverse economic conditions in those areas. Additionally, the Brazilian economy has been experiencing an economic recession since 2014. If negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or become more pervasive, consumers might make long-lasting changes to their discretionary spending behavior, including dining out less frequently on a permanent basis and generating lower average check sizes at our restaurants. If restaurant revenue decreases, our profitability could decline as we spread fixed costs across a lower level of revenue. Reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures could result from prolonged negative restaurant sales. There can be no assurance that the macroeconomic environment or the regional economics in which we operate will improve significantly or that government stimulus efforts will improve consumer confidence, liquidity, credit markets, home values or unemployment, among other things.\nThe future performance of the economies in the US, Brazil and other specific markets in which we operate is uncertain and may be affected by economic, political and other factors that are beyond our control. These factors, which also affect consumer spending on restaurant meals, include, among others, national, regional and local economic conditions, levels of disposable consumer income, consumer confidence and the effects of geopolitical incidents. We believe that any negative developments relating to these factors, whether actual or perceived, could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nWe face significant competition from other restaurant companies, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance and make it difficult to expand in new and existing markets.\nWe must compete successfully with other restaurant companies in existing or new markets in order to maintain and enhance our overall financial performance. The restaurant industry in the US, Brazil and other specific markets in which we operate is highly competitive in terms of price, quality of service, restaurant location, atmosphere, and type and quality of food. We compete with restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants (including, among others, churrascaria operators) for guests, restaurant locations and experienced management and staff. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources, have been in business for a longer period of time, have greater name recognition and are more established in the markets where we currently operate and where we plan to open new restaurants. Any inability to compete successfully with other restaurant companies may harm our ability to maintain or increase our revenue, force us to close one or more of our restaurants or limit our ability to expand our restaurant base. Restaurant closings would reduce our revenue and could subject us to significant costs, including severance payments to employees, write-downs of leasehold improvements, equipment, furniture and fixtures, and legal expenses. In addition, we could remain liable for remaining future lease obligations for any terminated restaurant locations.\nChurrascaria operators and other competitors in the steakhouse sector of our industry have continued to open restaurants in recent years. If we overestimate demand for our restaurants or underestimate the popularity of competing restaurants, we may be unable to realize anticipated revenue from existing or new restaurants. Similarly, if any of our competitors opens additional restaurants in existing or targeted markets, we may realize lower than expected revenue from our restaurants. Any decrease in the number of restaurant guests for any of our existing or new restaurants due to competition could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business and financial performance, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur Brazilian operations, our international joint ventures and any other future international operations, expose us to economic, regulatory and other risks associated with such countries.\nWe have long-standing operations in Brazil, where we now have 10 restaurants. Our Brazilian restaurants accounted for 14.8% of our revenues in Fiscal 2016, 16.4% in Fiscal 2015 and 23.7% in Fiscal 2014. We currently operate through joint ventures in Mexico and the Middle East and intend to expand into other international markets in the future. Our lack of experience in operating restaurants outside of the US and Brazil increases the risk that any international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. In addition, international operations, including our operations in Brazil, Mexico and the Middle East, subject us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ninflation and currency devaluations;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nforeign and legal regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including complexities of international tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nexpropriation or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring divestiture;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise);\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with different legal standards; and\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic conditions.\nWe are subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the US Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) regulations, other US laws and regulations governing our international operations and similar laws in other countries. Any violation of the FCPA, OFAC regulations or other applicable anti-corruption laws, by us, our affiliated entities or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or our availability of funds under our revolving line of credit. Further, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our management.\nWe depend on our joint venture partners to perform their obligations in Mexico and the Middle East. We also license certain of our trademarks to our Mexico and Middle East joint ventures for use in connection with operating the Fogo brand. If our partner fails to perform its obligations, or the licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with our trademarks, the value of our brand and our trademarks could potentially be harmed and negative publicity could also be associated with us.\nIf we are unable to account for these risks while operating abroad, our reputation and brand value could be harmed. The occurrence of any of these risks could negatively affect our current international operations and any future expansion into new geographic markets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex tax issues in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including in Brazil and Mexico, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in those jurisdictions.\nAs a multinational organization that operates in several jurisdictions, including the US, Brazil and Mexico, we may be subject to taxation in jurisdictions with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The tax positions that we have taken or may take in the future may be subject to challenge on audit, and the authorities in these jurisdictions, including Brazil and Mexico, could successfully assert that we are obligated to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties. In addition, the amount of taxes we pay could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operating results. The authorities could also claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could have a material impact on us and the results of our operations.\nBrazilian economic, political and other conditions, and Brazilian government policies or actions in response to these conditions, may negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial performance, as well as the market price of our common stock.\nThe Brazilian economy has been characterized by frequent and occasionally extensive intervention by the Brazilian government and unstable economic cycles. The Brazilian government has often changed monetary, taxation, credit, tariff and other policies to influence the course of the country\u2019s economy. For example, the government\u2019s actions to control inflation have at times involved setting wage and price controls, imposing exchange controls and limiting imports into Brazil. Additionally, in 2015, a series of protests began in Brazil against the then current government and President, which resulted in a slight reduction in guest traffic. In 2016, the former President of Brazil was impeached and protests occurred in a number of cities in December 2016 in response to government austerity plans. Further, the Brazilian House of Representatives approved in late February 2017 legislation regulating the collection of tips in commercial establishments. The legislation has been approved by the President and we anticipate the effective date will be May 13, 2017. We are evaluating the potential impact of such legislation on our business and prospective results of operations.\nWe have no control over, and cannot predict, what policies or actions the Brazilian government may take in the future, including in response to protesting activities. These factors, as well as uncertainty over whether the Brazilian government may implement changes in policy or regulations relating to these factors, could adversely affect us and our business, results of operations, financial performance and the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict what policies may be implemented by the Brazilian federal or state governments and whether these policies will negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected by exchange control policies, interest rates, liquidity of domestic capital and lending markets, social and political instability, and other economic, political, diplomatic and social developments affecting Brazil.\nThe Brazilian government regularly implements changes to tax regimes that may increase our tax burden. These changes include modifications in the rate of assessments, non-renewal of existing tax relief and, on occasion, enactment of temporary taxes the proceeds of which are earmarked for designated governmental purposes. Increases in our overall tax burden could negatively affect our overall financial performance and profitability.\nOur reporting currency is the US dollar but a significant portion of our revenue and costs and expenses are in the Brazilian Real, so that exchange rate movements may affect our financial performance.\nWe generate revenue, and incur costs and expenses, in our Brazilian operations denominated in Brazilian reais. The results of our Brazilian operations are translated from reais into US dollars upon consolidation when we prepare our consolidated financial statements. When the US dollar weakens relative to the Brazilian Real, the contribution of our Brazilian operations to our overall results of operations increases. By contrast, when the US dollar strengthens against the Real, the contribution of our Brazilian operations tends to decrease.\nThe Brazilian currency has historically been subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations in relation to the US dollar and other currencies and has been devalued frequently over the past four decades. These exchange rate movements have been attributable to economic conditions in Brazil, Brazilian governmental policies and actions, developments in global foreign exchange markets and other factors. The Real depreciated 14.3% against the US dollar during Fiscal 2014 and depreciated further by 48.5% during Fiscal 2015. The Real strengthened in relation to the US dollar 17.3% during Fiscal 2016. Our reported consolidated results of operations have periodically been affected by the strength of the US dollar relative to the Brazilian Real and further appreciation of the US dollar in the future periods could affect adversely our consolidated results of operations in those periods. Disruptions in financial markets may also result in significant changes in foreign exchange rates in relatively short periods of time which further increases the risk of an adverse currency effect. We do not currently use financial derivatives or hedging agreements to manage our currency exposure. In the future, we may choose to use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks. However, such activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from foreign currency variations.\nOur company\u2019s principal asset is its ownership interest in Fogo de Ch\u00e3o (Holdings) Inc. and if that subsidiary or our other subsidiaries are restricted from distributing or repatriating funds to us, pursuant to law, regulation or otherwise, our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have no material assets other than our ownership of the equity interests in our subsidiaries and no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent that we need funds, and our subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, such restrictions or inability could materially adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nBrazilian law permits the Brazilian government to impose temporary restrictions on conversions of Brazilian currency into foreign currencies and on remittances to foreign investors of proceeds from their investments in Brazil, whenever there is a serious imbalance in Brazil\u2019s balance of payments or there are reasons to expect a pending serious imbalance. Any imposition of restrictions on conversions and remittances could hinder or prevent our Brazilian subsidiaries from converting Brazilian currency into US dollars or other foreign currencies and remitting abroad dividends or distributions. As a result, any imposition of exchange controls restrictions could reduce the market prices of the shares of our common stock.\nAdditionally, the terms of our Credit Agreement, dated as of June 18, 2015, among Brasa (Holdings) Inc., as Borrower, Brasa (Purchaser) Inc., as Holdings, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as L/C Issuers and the other lenders party thereto (\u201c2015 Credit Facility\u201d) include a number of restrictive covenants that impose restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, make certain restricted payments, including dividends to us.\nCash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may also limit our ability to convert foreign currencies such as the Real into US dollars or to remit payments by our Brazilian subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls. We may face similar risks in other international jurisdictions in which we operate. While we have repatriated cash historically, in the future we do not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place, but should we need to do so to fund our operations, we may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash, or unable to do so without incurring substantial costs which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur future success depends upon the continued appeal of our restaurant concept and we are vulnerable to changes to consumer preferences.\nOur success depends, in considerable part, on the popularity of our menu offerings and the overall dining experience provided to guests by our restaurants. Any shift in consumer preferences away from our restaurant concept could negatively affect our financial performance. The restaurant industry is characterized by the continual introduction of new concepts and is subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences, tastes and dining habits. Our sales could be impacted by shifts in consumer preferences arising from dietary concerns relating to calories, sodium or carbohydrates. There can be no assurance that consumers will continue to regard churrascaria-inspired or steakhouse-based food favorably or that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to consumer preferences. Our business, financial condition and results of operations depend in part on our ability to anticipate, identify and respond to changing consumer preferences. Any failure by us to anticipate and respond to changing guest preferences could make our restaurants less appealing and adversely affect our business.\nOur historical revenue and AUVs may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOur revenue and AUVs have historically been, and will continue to be, affected by, among others, the following factors:\n\u2022\nour ability to execute effectively our business strategy;\n\u2022\nthe square footage and number of seats in new restaurants, which may vary from existing restaurants;\n\u2022\ninitial sales performance by new restaurants;\n\u2022\ncompetition;\n\u2022\nconsumer and demographic trends, in particular for ethnic foods, and levels of beef consumption; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and conditions specific to the restaurant industry.\nExisting restaurants may fail to maintain revenue and AUV levels consistent with our historical experience. New restaurants may not reach the historical revenue and AUV levels of our existing restaurants or according to our plans, if at all. Any decrease in our revenue or AUVs would negatively affect our financial performance, which could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nOur future growth depends on our ability to open new restaurants in existing and new markets and to operate these restaurants profitably.\nOur future financial performance will depend on our ability to execute our business strategy-in particular, to open new restaurants on a profitable basis. We currently operate 35 restaurants in the US, 10 restaurants in Brazil and two joint venture restaurants in Mexico. We opened four restaurants during Fiscal 2016, including our second joint venture restaurant in Mexico City, which opened in October 2016. Over the next five years, we plan to increase our company-owned restaurant count by at least 10% annually, with North America being our primary market for new restaurant development. In addition, we plan to grow in Brazil as well as other international markets, however there is no guarantee that we will be able to increase the number of our restaurants in North America or in international markets. Our ability to successfully open new restaurants is, in turn, dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nfinding and securing quality locations on acceptable financial terms;\n\u2022\ncomplying with applicable zoning, land use, environmental and other governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nobtaining, for an acceptable cost, required permits and approvals;\n\u2022\nhaving adequate financing for construction, opening and operating costs;\n\u2022\ncontrolling construction and equipment costs for new restaurants;\n\u2022\nweather, natural disasters and disasters beyond our control resulting in delays;\n\u2022\nhiring, training and retaining management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully promoting new restaurants and competing in the markets in which these are located.\nWe continuously review potential sites for future restaurants. Typically, we experience a \u201cstart-up\u201d period before a new restaurant achieves our targeted level of operating and financial performance which may include an initial start-up period of sales volatility. The start-up period varies for each new restaurant and may last as long as three years to achieve targeted results. In addition, we face higher operating costs caused by start-up costs including higher food, labor and other direct operating expenses and other temporary inefficiencies associated with opening new restaurants. We may also face challenges such as lack of brand recognition, market familiarity and acceptance when we enter new markets.\nOur long-term success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully identify appropriate sites and develop and expand our operations in existing and new markets.\nWe intend to develop new restaurants in our existing markets, and selectively enter into new markets. There can be no assurance that any new restaurant that we open will have similar operating results to those of existing restaurants. There is no guarantee that a sufficient number of suitable restaurant sites will be available in desirable areas or on terms that are acceptable to us, and we may not be able to open our planned new restaurants on a timely basis, if at all. Further, if opened, these restaurants may not be operated profitably. As part of our growth strategy, we may enter into geographic markets in which we have little or no prior operating experience. Consumer recognition of our brand has been important in the success of restaurants in our existing markets and recognition may be lacking in new geographic markets. In addition, restaurants we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction, occupancy or operating expenses than restaurants we open in existing markets, thereby affecting our overall profitability. Any failure on our part to recognize or respond to these challenges may adversely affect the success of any new restaurants.\nThe number and timing of new restaurants opened during any given period, and their associated contribution to operating growth, may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nidentification and availability of appropriate locations that will increase the number of restaurant guests and sales per unit;\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient funds from operations or to obtain acceptable financing to support our development;\n\u2022\nrecruitment and training of qualified operating personnel in the local market;\n\u2022\navailability of acceptable lease arrangements;\n\u2022\nconstruction and development cost management;\n\u2022\ntimely delivery of the leased premises to us from our landlords and punctual commencement and completion of our buildout construction activities;\n\u2022\ndelays due to the customized nature of our restaurant concepts and decor, construction and pre-opening processes for each new location;\n\u2022\nobtaining all necessary governmental licenses and permits, including our liquor licenses, on a timely basis to construct or remodel and operate our restaurants;\n\u2022\ninability to comply with certain covenants under our 2015 Credit Facility that could limit our ability to open new restaurants;\n\u2022\nconsumer tastes in new geographic regions and acceptance of our restaurant concept;\n\u2022\ncompetition in new markets, including competition for restaurant sites; unforeseen engineering or environmental problems with the leased premises;\n\u2022\nadverse weather during the construction period; anticipated commercial, residential and infrastructure development near our new restaurants; and\n\u2022\nother unanticipated increases in costs, any of which could give rise to delays or cost overruns.\nIf we are unable to successfully open new restaurants, our financial results or revenue growth could be adversely affected and our business negatively affected as we expect a portion of our growth to come from new restaurants.\nOur failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.\nOur growth plan includes opening a number of new restaurants. Our existing restaurant management systems, administrative staff, financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our planned expansion. Those demands on our infrastructure and resources may also adversely affect our ability to manage our existing restaurants. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to hire, train and retain managers, gaucho chefs and other team members. We may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on our management, restaurant teams and existing infrastructure which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe our gaucho culture is an important contributor to our success. As we grow, however, we may have difficulty maintaining our culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we do not maintain our infrastructure and culture as we grow.\nIncreases in the prices of, or reductions in the availability of, top-quality beef could reduce our operating margins and revenue.\nWe purchase substantial quantities of beef, including Angus Beef\u00ae (and its equivalent in Brazil), which is subject to significant price fluctuations due to conditions affecting livestock markets, weather, feed prices, industry demand and other factors. Our meat costs in the United States and Brazil accounted for approximately 52.2%, 54.4% and 54.7% of our total food and beverage costs during Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively. If the price for beef increases in the future and we choose not to pass, or cannot pass, these increases on to our guests, our operating margins could decrease significantly. In addition, if key beef items become unavailable for us to purchase, our revenue could decrease.\nWe may experience higher operating costs, including increases in supplier prices and employee salaries and benefits, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur ability to maintain consistent quality throughout our restaurants depends, in part, upon our ability to acquire fresh food products, including substantial quantities of beef, and related items from reliable sources in accordance with our specifications and in sufficient quantities. We have pricing agreements in place with a few suppliers for our beef purchases and for the purchase of certain other commodities in the US and short term contracts with a limited number of suppliers for the distribution of our other food purchases and other supplies for our restaurants. We do not have any supply agreements or pricing agreements in place in Brazil, and therefore we are subject to risks of shortages and price fluctuations with respect to our food purchases for our restaurants in Brazil. Our largest suppliers of beef in the US and Brazil accounted for 95%, 94%, and 75% of our beef purchases in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers subjects us to risks of shortages, delivery interruptions and price fluctuations. If our suppliers do not perform adequately or otherwise fail to distribute supplies to our restaurants, we may be unable to replace them in a short period of time on acceptable terms. Any inability to so replace suppliers could increase our costs or cause shortages at our restaurants of food and other items that may cause us to remove popular items from a restaurant\u2019s menu or temporarily close a restaurant, which could result in a loss of guests and, consequently, revenue during the time of the shortage and thereafter, if our guests change their dining habits as a result.\nIf we pay higher prices for food items or other supplies or increase compensation or benefits to our employees, we will sustain an increase in our operating costs. Many factors affect the prices paid for food and other items, including conditions affecting livestock markets, weather, changes in demand and inflation. Factors that may affect compensation and benefits paid to our employees include changes in minimum wage and employee benefits laws (as discussed below). Other factors that could cause our operating costs to increase include fuel prices, occupancy and related costs, maintenance expenditures and increases in other day-to-day expenses. If we are unable or unwilling to increase our menu prices or take other actions to offset increased operating costs, we could experience a decline in our financial performance.\nWe rely heavily on certain vendors, suppliers and distributors, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to maintain consistent price and quality throughout our restaurants depends in part upon our ability to acquire specified food products and supplies in sufficient quantities from third-party vendors, suppliers and distributors at a reasonable cost. We rely on US Foods, Inc. (\u201cUS Foods\u201d) as one of our primary distributors in the United States. In Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, we spent approximately 75%, 74%, and 72%, respectively, of our food and beverage costs in the US on products and supplies procured from US Foods. Our agreement with US Foods may be terminated by either us or US Foods upon 60 days\u2019 written notice. We do not control the businesses of our vendors, suppliers and distributors, and our efforts to specify and monitor the standards under which they perform may not be successful. Furthermore, certain food items are perishable, and we have limited control over whether these items will be delivered to us in appropriate condition for use in our restaurants. If any of our vendors, suppliers or distributors are unable to fulfill their obligations to our standards, or if we are unable to find replacement providers in the event of a supply or service disruption, we could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not have any supply agreements or distribution agreements in Brazil that have concentration on one vendor.\nOur marketing programs may not be successful.\nWe believe our brand is critical to our business. We incur costs and expend other resources in our marketing efforts to raise brand awareness and attract and retain guests. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenue. Additionally, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which enable them to spend significantly more than we are able to on marketing and advertising. Should our competitors increase spending on marketing and advertising or our marketing funds decrease for any reason, or should our advertising and promotions be less effective than our competitors, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny negative publicity surrounding our restaurants or our sector of the restaurant industry could adversely affect the number of restaurant guests, which could reduce revenue in our restaurants.\nWe believe that any adverse publicity concerning the quality of our food and our restaurants generally could damage our brand and adversely affect the future success of our business. Company-specific adverse publicity, including inaccurate publicity, could take different forms, such as negative reviews by restaurant or word-of-mouth criticisms emanating from our guest base. The experience of other restaurants and restaurant chains with incidents relating to food-borne illnesses that affect their business could adversely affect our sector of the restaurant industry. Also, there has been a recent increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices, including weblogs (blogs), social media websites, and other forms of Internet-based communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants can post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. There is significant opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information. Information concerning our company or our sector of the restaurant industry may be posted on such platforms at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, either of which may harm our business and financial performance. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nNegative publicity relating to the consumption of food products, including in connection with food-borne illness, could result in reduced consumer demand for our menu offerings, which could reduce sales.\nInstances of food-borne illness, including Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, which is also known as BSE, and aphthous fever, as well as hepatitis A, lysteria, salmonella, norovirus and e-coli, whether or not found in the US or Brazil or traced directly to one of our suppliers or our restaurants, could reduce demand for our menu offerings. We cannot guarantee that our internal controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all food safety issues at our restaurants, including instances of food-borne illnesses. Any negative publicity relating to these and other health-related matters may affect consumers\u2019 perceptions of our restaurants and the food that we offer, reduce guest visits to our restaurants and negatively impact demand for our menu offerings. Adverse publicity relating to any of these matters, beef in general or other similar concerns could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, food-borne illnesses and injuries caused by food tampering have had in the past, and could have in the future, an adverse effect on the price and availability of certain of our produce and meat offerings.\nOur company could face lawsuits relating to workplace and employment laws and fair credit reporting requirements, which, if determined adversely, could result in negative publicity or in payment of substantial damages by us.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern our relationships with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws include employee classifications as exempt or non-exempt, minimum wage requirements, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, tip reporting and classification, citizenship requirements and other wage and benefit requirements for employees classified as non-exempt. Our business may be adversely affected by legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of our employees or guests. Although we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. We currently participate in the \u201cE-Verify\u201d program, an Internet-based, free program run by the United States government to verify employment eligibility, in states in which participation is required. However, use of the \u201cE-Verify\u201d program does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties, and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees who were unauthorized employees may disrupt our operations, cause temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all record-keeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, a number of restaurant companies, including our company, have been subject to lawsuits and other claims, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state law governing workplace and employment matters such as various forms of discrimination, tip pooling, wrongful termination, harassment and similar matters and violations of fair credit reporting requirements. A number of these lawsuits and claims against other companies have resulted in various penalties, including the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. In addition, lawsuits by employees or on behalf of our employees are common in Brazil after termination of employment and we have been subject to a number of such lawsuits. Insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover all liabilities with respect to these matters. Accordingly, we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from claims and lawsuits, which would increase our operating costs, decrease funds available for the development of our business and result in charges to our income statements resulting in decreased profitability or net losses. Employee claims against us also create not only legal and financial liability but negative publicity that could adversely affect us and divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit the future performance of our operations.\nLitigation concerning food quality, health, employee conduct and other issues could require us to incur additional liabilities or cause guests to avoid our restaurants.\nRestaurant companies have from time to time faced lawsuits alleging that a guest suffered illness or injury during or after a visit to a restaurant, including actions seeking damages resulting from food-borne illness and relating to notices with respect to chemicals contained in food products required under state law. Similarly, food tampering, employee hygiene and cleanliness failures or improper employee conduct at our restaurants could lead to product liability or other claims. To date, we have not been a defendant in any lawsuit asserting such a claim. However, we cannot assure you that such a lawsuit will not be filed against us and we cannot guarantee to consumers that our internal controls and training will be fully effective in preventing claims. We are also subject to various claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims and other matters. In addition, we could become subject to class action lawsuits related to these and other matters in the future. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management attention and other resources from our operations and hurt our financial performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, adverse publicity resulting from any such claims may negatively impact revenue at one or more of our restaurants.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation and we may incur additional costs or liabilities as a result of government regulation of our restaurants.\nOur business is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign government regulation, including, among others, regulations related to the preparation and sale of food, the sale of alcoholic beverages, zoning and building codes, land use and employee, health, sanitation and safety matters.\nTypically, our licenses to sell alcoholic beverages must be renewed annually and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause. Alcoholic beverage control regulations govern various aspects of daily operations of our restaurants, including the minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control, handling and storage. Any failure by any of our restaurants to obtain and maintain, on a timely basis, liquor or other licenses, permits or approvals required to serve alcoholic beverages or food, as well as any associated negative publicity, could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, and could have an adverse effect on, that restaurant and its operating and financial performance. We apply for our liquor licenses with the advice of outside legal counsel and licensing consultants. Because of the many and various state and federal licensing and permitting requirements, there is a significant risk that one or more regulatory agencies could determine that we have not complied with applicable licensing or permitting regulations or have not maintained the approvals necessary for us to conduct business within its jurisdiction. Any changes in the application or interpretation of existing laws may adversely impact our restaurants in that state, and could also cause us to lose, either temporarily or permanently, the licenses, permits and regulations necessary to conduct our restaurant operations, and subject us to fines and penalties.\nThere is also a potential for increased regulation of certain food establishments in the US, where compliance with a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (\u201cHACCP\u201d) approach would be required. HACCP refers to a management system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of potential hazards from production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product. Many states have required restaurants to develop and implement HACCP Systems, and the United States government continues to expand the sectors of the food industry that must adopt and implement HACCP programs. For example, the Food Safety Modernization Act (the \u201cFSMA\u201d), signed into law in January 2011, granted the FDA new authority regarding the safety of the entire food system, including through increased inspections and mandatory food recalls. Although restaurants are specifically exempted from or not directly implicated by some of these new requirements, we anticipate that the new requirements may impact our industry. Additionally, our suppliers may initiate or otherwise be subject to food recalls that may impact the availability of certain products, result in adverse publicity or require us to take actions that could be costly for us or otherwise impact our business.\nOur restaurants in the US are subject to state \u201cdram shop\u201d laws, which generally allow a person to sue us if that person was injured by an intoxicated person who was wrongfully served alcoholic beverages at one of our restaurants. Recent litigation against restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments, including punitive damages, under dram shop laws. A judgment against us under a dram shop law could exceed our liability insurance coverage policy limits and could result in substantial liability for us and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our inability to continue to obtain such insurance coverage at reasonable cost also could have a material adverse effect on us. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, we may be adversely affected by publicity resulting from such laws.\nWe are also required to comply with the standards mandated by the ADA, which generally prohibits discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability. We may in the future have to modify restaurants or our operations to make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. While these expenses could be material, our current expectation is that any such actions will not require us to expend substantial funds.\nThe costs of operating our restaurants may increase in the event of changes in laws governing minimum hourly wages, working conditions, predictive scheduling, overtime and tip credits, health care, workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates, unemployment tax rates, sales taxes or other laws and regulations, such as those governing access for the disabled (including the ADA). If any of these costs were to increase and we were unable or unwilling to pass on such costs to our guests by increasing menu prices or by other means, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nFailure to comply with federal, state or local regulations could cause our licenses to be revoked and force us to cease the sale of alcoholic beverages at certain restaurants. Any difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining such licenses, permits or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a restaurant in a particular area or increase the costs associated therewith. In addition, in certain states, including states where we have existing restaurants or where we plan to open a restaurant, the number of liquor licenses available is limited, and licenses are traded on the open market. Liquor, beer and wine sales comprise a significant portion of our revenue. If we are unable to maintain our existing licenses, our guest patronage, revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected. Or, if we choose to open a restaurant in those states where the number of licenses available is limited, the cost of a new license could be significant.\nAny failure to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights could adversely affect the value of our brand.\nWe have registered our principal trademarks including the FOGO, FOGO DE CH\u00c3O and BAR FOGO marks, the campfire design and other marks used by our restaurants as trade names, trademarks or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, in Brazil and in numerous foreign countries. The trademarks we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the US in which we do business or may do business in the future. We may never register such trademarks in all of these countries and, even if we do, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the US. We believe that our intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success. The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our intellectual property in order to increase our brand awareness, and the unauthorized use or other misappropriation of our intellectual property in the US or any foreign countries could diminish the value of our brands and restaurant concept and may cause a decline in our revenue. We are aware of names similar to those of our restaurants used by third parties in certain limited geographical areas in the US, Brazil and elsewhere. Protective actions taken by us with respect to these rights may fail to prevent unauthorized usage or imitation by others, which could harm our reputation, brands or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal expenses.\nThe impact of negative economic factors, including the availability of credit, on our landlords and other retail center tenants could negatively affect our financial results.\nNegative effects on our existing and potential landlords due to any inaccessibility of credit and other unfavorable economic factors may, in turn, adversely affect our business and results of operations. If our landlords are unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, they may be unable to provide construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. If any landlord files for bankruptcy protection, the landlord may be able to reject our lease in the bankruptcy proceedings. While we would have the option to retain our rights under the lease, we could not compel the landlord to perform any of its obligations and would be left with damages as our sole recourse. In addition, if our landlords are unable to obtain sufficient credit to continue to properly manage their retail sites, we may experience a drop in the level of quality of such retail centers. Our development of new restaurants may also be adversely affected by the negative financial situations of developers and potential landlords.\nWe occupy most of our restaurants under long-term non-cancelable leases, which we may be unable to renew at the end of the lease terms or which may limit our flexibility to move to new locations.\nAll but two of our restaurants in the US are located in leased premises and all of our restaurants in Brazil are located in leased premises. Many of our current leases in the US are non-cancelable and usually have terms ranging from 10 to 20 years, with renewal options for terms ranging from five to 10 years. We anticipate that leases that we enter into in the future in the US will also be long-term and non-cancelable and have similar renewal options. If we were to close or fail to open a restaurant at a leased location, we would generally remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which could include, among other things, payment of the base rent and a percentage of common area operating expenses for the balance of the lease term. Our obligation to continue making rental payments and fulfilling other lease obligations under leases for closed or unopened restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Lease rates in Brazil are periodically readjusted and the rent amounts are not predetermined as they are in the US. If the landlord and we cannot agree on an adjusted rate, the dispute is submitted to a judicial resolution process. As a result, our lease rates in Brazil are subject to more volatility than those in the US and we may not always be able to predict these rates due to the unpredictable nature of the judicial resolution process, which could be unfavorable to us.\nAt the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a restaurant, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. If we are unable to renew our restaurant leases, we may be forced to close or relocate a restaurant, which could subject us to significant construction and other costs. For example, closing a restaurant, even for a brief period to permit relocation, would reduce the revenue contribution of that restaurant to our total revenue. Additionally, the revenue and profit, if any, generated at a relocated restaurant may not equal the revenue and profit generated at the previous restaurant location.\nLong-term leases can, however, limit our flexibility to move a restaurant to a new location. For example, current locations may no longer be attractive in the event that demographic patterns shift or neighborhood conditions decline. In addition, long-term leases may affect our ability to take advantage of more favorable rent levels due to changes in local real estate market conditions. These and other location-related issues may affect the financial performance of individual restaurants.\nOur rent expense could increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and could limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nOur rent expense accounted for approximately 7.3%, 6.8% and 6.4% of our revenue in Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively. We expect that new restaurants will typically be leased by us under operating leases. Substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our available cash to be applied to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain any necessary financing; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or our industry.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease obligations and to fulfill our other cash requirements. If our restaurants do not generate sufficient cash flow and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under bank loans or from other sources, we may not be able to meet our lease obligations, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nOpening new restaurants in existing markets may negatively affect sales at our existing restaurants.\nThe consumer target area of our restaurants varies by location, depending on a number of factors, including population density, other local retail and business attractions, area demographics and geography. As a result, the opening of a new restaurant in or near markets in which we already have restaurants could adversely affect sales at these existing restaurants. Existing restaurants could also make it more difficult to build our consumer base for a new restaurant in the same market. Our core business strategy does not entail opening new restaurants that we believe will materially affect sales at our existing restaurants, but we may selectively open new restaurants in and around areas of existing restaurants that are operating at or near capacity to effectively serve our guests. Sales cannibalization among our restaurants may become significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations and could affect our sales growth, which could, in turn, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on securing desirable restaurant locations.\nThe success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location. There can be no assurance that the current locations of our restaurant will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or economic conditions where stores are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations. Competition for restaurant locations can also be intense and there may be delay or cancellation of new store developments by our franchise partners, which may be exacerbated by factors related to the commercial real estate or credit markets. If we cannot obtain desirable locations for our restaurant at reasonable prices due to, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition, construction and/or development costs of new locations, difficulty negotiating leases with acceptable terms, onerous land use or zoning restrictions, or challenges in securing required governmental permits, then our ability to open new restaurants and our ability to meet our growth expectations may be adversely affected.\nLabor shortages or increases in labor costs could slow our growth and adversely affect our ability to operate our restaurants.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and gaucho chefs necessary to meet the needs of our existing restaurants and to support our expansion program. Qualified personnel to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. If we are unable to continue to recruit and retain sufficiently qualified personnel, our business and our growth could be adversely affected. Any future inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel may delay openings of new restaurants and could adversely impact existing restaurants. Any such delays, any material increases in employee turnover rates in existing restaurants or any employee dissatisfaction could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nIncreases in minimum wages or unionization activities could substantially increase our labor costs.\nUnder the minimum wage laws in most jurisdictions in the US, we are permitted to pay certain hourly employees a wage that is less than the base minimum wage for general employees because these employees receive tips as a substantial part of their income. As of January 1, 2017, approximately 35.8% of our employees in the US earn this lower minimum wage in their respective locations as tips constitute a substantial part of their income. If federal, state or local governments change their laws to require that all employees be paid the general employee minimum base wage regardless of supplemental tip income, our labor costs would increase substantially. Our labor costs would also increase if the minimum base wage increases. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases, changes to eligibility for overtime pay, paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals, and similar requirements and these changes could increase our labor costs. We may be unable or unwilling to increase our prices in order to pass increased labor costs on to our guests, in which case our operating margins would be adversely affected. Also, although none of our employees in the US are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, many of our employees in Brazil participate in industry-wide trade union programs. Additionally, our employees in the US may elect or attempt to be represented by labor unions in the future. If a significant number of our employees were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth may be hindered by immigration restrictions, our inability to obtain necessary visas and work permits for foreign workers and changes in United States immigration laws and regulations, particularly with respect to L-1B visa eligibility.\nOur future success could depend on our ability to attract and retain employees with specialized culinary skills. Many of our gaucho chefs in the US are Brazilian nationals whose ability to work in the US depends on obtaining and maintaining necessary visas and work permits (which may or may not be tied to their employment with us).\nImmigration and work permit laws and regulations in the US are subject to changes, both in substance as well as in the application of standards and enforcement. Immigration and work permit laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political considerations and economic conditions in the US. Immigration reform continues to attract significant attention in the public arena, the US Congress and the White House Administration. If new immigration or work permit legislation is enacted or executive orders are issued, such laws and orders may contain provisions that could increase our costs in recruiting, training and retaining employees and increase our costs of complying with federal law in reviewing employees\u2019 immigration status. Furthermore, increased enforcement efforts with respect to existing immigration laws and orders by governmental authorities may disrupt a portion of our workforce or our operations. We have been, and may in the future be, unable to obtain visas or work permits to bring necessary employees to the US for any number of reasons including, among others, limits set by the US Department of Homeland Security or the US Department of State. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Bureau of Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS, formerly INS) began to narrow its interpretation of L-1B visa eligibility as to all corporate petitioners in 2007 and 2008. Beginning in 2009, the USCIS ceased approving our L-1B visas and recommended that the petitions of 10 then current L-1B visa holders be revoked.\nWe contested the adverse actions before USCIS, and then sued USCIS in US District Court. The US District Court affirmed the USCIS denials in 2013, but we appealed that determination, and on October 21, 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted our appeal, reversed the USCIS denial, and remanded the representative L-1B petition in question to the district court, with instructions to vacate the denial and to remand to USCIS for further consideration in light of the Court\u2019s correction of USCIS\u2019s factual and legal adjudication errors. USCIS reopened the matter pursuant to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s remand order. On June 12, 2015, USCIS again denied the L-1B petition. On August 7, 2015, we filed a complaint for declaratory and mandamus relief in the US District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to overturn the latest USCIS denial and effectuate the prior holding of the D.C. Circuit. On September 26, 2016, the District Court ruled that the USCIS improperly disregarded substantial evidence as our evidence was adequate to conclude that the gaucho churrasqueiro position involves specialized knowledge but that we did not provide enough evidence that a particular individual completed our training program. Neither we nor the government appealed this determination. We therefore intend to file new L-1B petitions for our gauchos in the near future, but we have no assurances at this point that USCIS will follow the recent district court determination.\nDue to the current climate and uncertainty relative to the process of requesting and obtaining L-1B visas, as well as recent denials of certain requests, we will continue to explore all available legal means to bring employees from Brazil to work in our restaurants in the US. Recent executive orders by the new US administration have created additional uncertainty regarding our ability to bring employees from Brazil to work in our restaurants. Continued compliance with existing US or foreign immigration laws or changes in such laws, making it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limiting our ability to retain visas or work permits for current employees in the US, could materially adversely affect our expansion strategy and, more generally, our business and financial performance.\nThe effect of changes to healthcare laws in the United States may increase the number of employees who choose to participate in our healthcare plans, which may significantly increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results.\nIn 2010, the PPACA was signed into law in the US to require health care coverage for many uninsured individuals and expand coverage to those already insured. We currently offer and subsidize a portion of comprehensive healthcare coverage, primarily for our salaried employees. The healthcare reform law currently requires us to offer healthcare benefits to all full-time employees (including full-time hourly employees) who meet certain minimum requirements of coverage and affordability, or face penalties. If we elect to offer such benefits we may incur substantial expense. If we fail to offer such benefits, or the benefits we elect to offer do not meet the applicable requirements, we may incur penalties. The healthcare reform law also requires individuals to obtain coverage or face individual penalties, so employees who are currently eligible but elect not to participate in our healthcare plans may find it more advantageous to do so when such individual mandates take effect. It is also possible that by making changes or failing to make changes in the healthcare plans offered by us we will become less competitive in the market for our labor. Finally, implementing the requirements of healthcare reform is likely to impose additional administrative costs. The costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty, but they may significantly increase our healthcare coverage costs and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislation and regulations requiring the display and provision of nutritional information for our menu offerings, and new information or attitudes regarding diet and health or adverse opinions about the health effects of consuming our menu offerings, could affect consumer preferences and negatively impact our results of operations.\nGovernment regulation and consumer eating habits may impact our business as a result of changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming our menu offerings. These changes have resulted in, and may continue to result in, the enactment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu offerings, or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food offerings.\nThe PPACA establishes a uniform, federal requirement for certain restaurants to post certain nutritional information on their menus. Specifically, the PPACA amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to require chain restaurants with 20 or more locations operating under the same name and offering substantially the same menus to publish the total number of calories of standard menu items on menus and menu boards, along with a statement that puts this calorie information in the context of a total daily calorie intake. The PPACA also requires covered restaurants to provide to consumers, upon request, a written summary of detailed nutritional information for each standard menu item, and to provide a statement on menus and menu boards about the availability of this information. The PPACA further permits the United States Food and Drug Administration to require covered restaurants to make additional nutrient disclosures, such as disclosure of trans-fat content. An unfavorable report on, or reaction to, our menu ingredients, the size of our portions or the nutritional content of our menu items could negatively influence the demand for our offerings.\nFurthermore, a number of states, counties and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose certain nutritional information to guests, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. Among those are California and New York City, although we believe the PPACA is intended to pre-empt conflicting state or local laws on nutritional labeling.\nCompliance with current and future laws and regulations regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items may be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, some government authorities are increasing regulations regarding trans-fats and sodium, which may require us to limit or eliminate trans-fats and sodium in our offerings, switch to higher cost ingredients or may hinder our ability to operate in certain markets. Some jurisdictions have banned certain cooking ingredients, such as trans-fats, or have discussed banning certain products, such as large sodas.\nRemoval of these products and ingredients from our menus could affect product tastes, guest satisfaction levels, and sales volumes, whereas if we fail to comply with these laws or regulations, our business could experience a material adverse effect.\nWe cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or our ability to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. The imposition of additional menu-labeling laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as on the restaurant industry in general.\nHealth concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe United States, Brazil, Mexico and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of neurological diseases or other diseases or viruses, such as norovirus, influenza, Zika and H1N1. If a virus is transmitted by human contact, our employees or customers could become infected, or could choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public places, any one of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA breach of security of confidential consumer information related to our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions could substantially affect our reputation and financial results.\nA significant majority of our sales are by credit or debit cards. Other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information has been stolen. We use third-party providers to process our sales by credit or gift card. If the security of such providers is compromised, then we may be subject to unplanned losses, expenses, fines or penalties. We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings relating to these types of incidents. In addition, most states have enacted legislation requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information, including credit and debit card information. Claims or proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issues cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such claim or proceeding could cause us to incur significant unplanned expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may have a material adverse effect on us and our restaurants.\nWe rely heavily on information technology, and any material failure, weakness, interruption or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, payment of obligations, collection of cash, credit and debit card transactions and other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms, expanding our systems as we grow or a breach in security of these systems could result in delays in guest service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Remediation of such problems could result in significant, unplanned capital investments.\nChanges to estimates related to our property, fixtures and equipment, goodwill or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain restaurant locations may cause us to incur impairment charges, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn accordance with accounting guidance as it relates to the impairment of long-lived assets, we make certain estimates and projections with regard to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance, in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. When impairment triggers are deemed to exist for any location, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded. Additionally, we test our reporting units for impairment of goodwill annually. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit, estimated using a combination of methodologies, to its carrying amount and, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its fair value, we would measure the impairment loss. The projections of future cash flows, and application of other methodologies, used in these analyses require the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If future impairment charges are significant, our reported operating results would be adversely affected.\nChanges to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges to existing accounting rules or regulations may impact our future results of operations or cause the perception that we are more highly leveraged. Other new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. Future changes to accounting rules or regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842).\u201d The new standard establishes a right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The new standard could have a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet as we will likely record material assets and obligations for current operating leases. We are currently evaluating the impact that adoption could have on our consolidated statement of income but the recognition of liabilities for our lease obligations could negatively impact our financial results.\nLoss of key management personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.\nOur success will continue to depend, to a significant extent, on our leadership team and other key management personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficiently experienced and capable management personnel, our business and financial results may suffer. If members of our leadership team or other key management personnel leave, we may have difficulty replacing them, and our business may suffer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain our leadership team and other key management personnel that we need. We also do not maintain any key man life insurance policies for any of our employees.\nOur current insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims, and we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to general liability, property and casualty liability, liquor liability, employer\u2019s liability and other insurable risks. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not commercially reasonable to insure. For example, insurance covering liability for violations of wage and hour laws has not generally been available. We also self-insure for workers\u2019 compensation and health benefits under plans with high deductibles. Losses for such uninsured claims, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCompliance with environmental laws may negatively affect our business.\nWe are subject to national, provincial, state and local laws and regulations in the US, Brazil and Mexico concerning waste disposal, pollution, protection of the environment, and the presence, discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance and liabilities for remediation, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such hazardous or toxic substances at, on or from our restaurants. Environmental conditions relating to releases of hazardous substances at prior, existing or future restaurant sites could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, environmental laws, and the administration, interpretation and enforcement thereof, are subject to change and may become more stringent in the future, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of January 1, 2017, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $12.7 million and $9.4 million, respectively, including federal general business credits of approximately $10.8 million. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d its ability to use its prechange net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We experienced an ownership change in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or other prechange tax attributes, to offset US federal and state taxable income may be subject to significant limitations. As of January 1, 2017, none of the operating loss or general business credit carryforwards are subject to limitation. Our current net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2033 and 2032 respectively.\nThe amount of money that we have borrowed and may, in the future borrow, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating activities.\nOur 2015 Credit Facility provides for a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d). The loans under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on June 24, 2020.\nAs of January 1, 2017, we had total aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt of $150.0 million, $4.9 million in outstanding letters of credit and $95.1 million of available borrowing capacity remaining under our 2015 Credit Facility. Our 2015 Credit Facility and any other debt incurred in the future, may have important consequences to holders of our common stock, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022\nwe may use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, rather than for operations or other purposes;\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with proportionately less debt; and\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited.\nWe expect that we will depend primarily upon cash flow from operations to pay interest and other amounts due under our 2015 Credit Facility and any other indebtedness we may incur in the future. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by business, financial, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets or borrow more money. We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including our 2015 Credit Facility, may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives.\nOur 2015 Credit Facility imposes operating and financial restrictions that may impair our ability to respond to changing business and industry conditions.\nOur 2015 Credit Facility contains restrictions and covenants that generally limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\nuse assets as collateral in other transactions;\n\u2022\nsell assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\npay dividends to, or purchase stock from, our stockholders;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell stock or other ownership interests in our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\ncreate or permit restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make payments to us.\nOur 2015 Credit Facility limits our ability to engage in these types of transactions even if we believed that a specific transaction would contribute to our future growth or improve our results of operations. Our 2015 Credit Facility requires us to meet specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. We are required to maintain a maximum Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio (as defined under our 2015 Credit Facility), at levels that vary until maturity, and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined under our 2015 Credit Facility), which, beginning with the third quarter ended September 27, 2015, were 5.50 to 1 and 2.00 to 1, through the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016. Starting in Fiscal 2017 and through Fiscal 2018, the Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio may not be greater than 5.25 to 1 and the ratio will further reduce to 5.00 to 1 in Fiscal 2019 through maturity. Starting in Fiscal 2017, the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio may not be less than 2.00 to 1 through maturity. As of the date hereof, we were in compliance with our 2015 Credit Facility\u2019s financial covenants. However, breach of these provisions or failure to comply with these financial ratios could result in a default under the 2015 Credit Facility, in which case our lenders would have the right to declare borrowings to be immediately due and payable. Our lenders may also accelerate payment of borrowings upon the occurrence of certain change of control events relating to us. If we are unable to repay borrowings when due, whether at maturity or following a default or change of control event, our lenders would have the right to take or sell assets pledged as collateral to secure the indebtedness. Any such actions taken by our lenders or other creditors would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe THL Funds have a substantial ownership interest in our common stock. Conflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are principals of the THL Funds.\nThe THL Funds collectively beneficially own approximately 79.1% of our outstanding common stock. As a consequence, the THL Funds are able to control matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and any other significant transaction. The interests of the THL Funds may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders.\nThe THL Funds could invest in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us. As a result of these relationships, when conflicts arise between the interests of the THL Funds and the interests of our stockholders, these directors may not be disinterested. The representatives of the THL Funds on our Board of Directors, by the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the amended and restated registration rights agreement among the Company, the THL Funds, management stockholders and other investors named in the agreement, are not required to offer us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as our directors.\nThe THL Funds may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders in the future.\nThe THL Funds may exert significant influence over, and could control, matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of major corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control of our company and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of the THL Funds.\nThe interests of the THL Funds may not always be consistent with the interests of our company or of other stockholders. Accordingly, the THL Funds could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements of which holders of our common stock would not approve or make decisions with which such holders would disagree.\nThe THL Funds are in the business of making investments in companies and could from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete with us. The THL Funds may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, desirable acquisitions may not be available to us.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ rules and, as a result, are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements.\nSo long as the THL Funds maintain holdings of more than 50% of the voting power of our capital stock, we will be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ corporate governance standards. Under these standards, a company need not comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of our board of directors consist of \u201cindependent directors\u201d as defined under NASDAQ rules;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities, or otherwise have director nominees selected by vote of a majority of the independent directors; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWe are not required to have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors and our compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee does not consist entirely of independent directors and are not subject to annual performance evaluations. If we are no longer eligible to rely on the controlled company exception, we will seek to comply with all applicable NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, but we will be able to rely on phase-in periods for certain of these requirements in accordance with NASDAQ rules. Accordingly, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline, and you could lose all or a significant part of your investment.\nThe market price of, and trading volume for, our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022\ninitiatives undertaken by our competitors, including, for example, the opening of restaurants in our existing markets;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations, and our and our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock, or changes in estimates by analysts who cover us and competitors in our industry;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nadoption or modification of laws, regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business or announcements relating to these matters;\n\u2022\nany increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n\u2022\nactions by stockholders;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of lock-up agreements entered into by our existing stockholders in connection with our initial public offering;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical incidents; and\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of us, our competitors and our industry.\nAs a result of these and other factors, our stockholders may experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the value of their shares of our common stock, including decreases unrelated to our financial performance or prospects.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our common stock declines significantly, stockholders may be unable to resell shares of our common stock at or above their purchase price, if at all. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future.\nCertain broad market and industry factors may materially decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including recently. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and decreases in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause the market price of such shares to fall.\nIf our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that major stockholders might sell substantial amounts of our common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock. A decline in the market price of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nFuture offerings of equity by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of our common stock or by offering debt or other equity securities, including senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. Opening new restaurants in existing and new markets could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations. We would expect to finance the capital required for new restaurants through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness and cash from operations.\nIssuing additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock or both. Upon liquidation, holders of such debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designates a state or federal court located within the state of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, with certain limited exceptions, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state or federal court located within the state of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to said Delaware court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain all of our earnings for the foreseeable future to fund the operation and growth of our business and to repay indebtedness, and therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our capital stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination regarding the payment of any dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, liquidity, contractual restrictions, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nOur future capital requirements are uncertain, and we may have difficulty raising money in the future on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur capital requirements depend on many factors, including the amounts required to open new restaurants and to service our indebtedness. To the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet these requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth, reduce our costs and expenses, or sell certain of our assets. Any additional equity offerings or debt financings may be on terms that are not favorable to us. Equity offerings could result in dilution to our stockholders, and equity or debt securities issued in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock. If our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital.\nProvisions of our charter documents, Delaware law and other documents could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\npermit us to issue preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each series, fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting powers, if any, of the shares of the series and the preferences and other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions, of the shares of the series;\n\u2022\nrestrict the ability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nrequire the affirmative vote of 662/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote to approve certain transactions or to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of stockholders to amend our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals; and\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms.\nThese provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of our company, including a transaction in which the acquiror may offer a premium price for our common stock.\nOur equity incentive plans also permit vesting of stock options and restricted stock, and payments to be made to the employees thereunder, in connection with a change of control of our company, which could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price. In addition, our 2015 Credit Facility includes and other debt incurred by us in the future may include, provisions entitling the lenders to demand immediate repayment of borrowings upon the occurrence of certain change of control events relating to our company, which also could discourage, delay or prevent a business combination transaction.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our company or if they downgrade us or other restaurant companies in our industry.\nThe market price of our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not influence or control the reporting of these analysts. In addition, if no analysts provide coverage of our company or if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade shares of our company or other companies in our industry, the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which could, in turn, cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.\nWe have an aggregate of 1.4 million shares of common stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans. We may issue all of these shares of common stock without any action or approval by our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. Any common stock issued in connection with our equity incentive plans, the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our stockholders.\nOur costs have increased as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to complying with public company regulations.\nAs a public company and particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d (to the extent that we take advantage of certain exceptions from reporting requirements that are available under the JOBS Act as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d), we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses not incurred prior to our IPO. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules promulgated by the SEC and the NASDAQ, require us to adopt corporate governance practices applicable to US public companies. These rules and regulations have increased and may in the future increase our legal and financial compliance costs.\nSarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ, have imposed increased disclosure and enhanced corporate governance practices for public companies. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, and our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to result in increased expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. We may not be successful in implementing and maintaining these requirements and implementing or maintaining them could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we fail to implement and maintain the requirements with respect to our internal accounting and audit functions, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis could be impaired.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and comply with reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if we begin to comply with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future. We cannot predict whether our common stock is less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If our common stock is less attractive as a result of our reliance on the available exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we are choosing to opt out of any extended transition period, and as a result we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.\nWe previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Although the identified material weaknesses have been remediated, we may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nWe are required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) and to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Section 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Pursuant to the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years following our initial public offering.\nIn connection with the audit of our financial statements for Fiscal 2013, the period from May 24, 2012 to December 30, 2012, and the period from January 2, 2012 to July 20, 2012, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Our previously disclosed material weaknesses related to the following have been remediated as of January 1, 2017:\n\u2022\ndesign an effective control environment with sufficient personnel with the appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training to assess the completeness and accuracy of the technical accounting matters, principally related to accounting for business combinations and accounting for modifications of debt instruments;\n\u2022\nhave a sufficient number of accounting personnel to allow for appropriate segregation of duties or thorough review and supervision of our financial closing process; and\n\u2022\ndesign, maintain or implement effective control activities to adequately review and account for transactions that arise in the normal course of business, which limited our ability to make accounting decisions and to detect and correct accounting errors.\nThese material weaknesses resulted in errors in the accounting for and classification of certain transactions, which resulted in a restatement of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2014 and the restatement of the first three fiscal quarters of Fiscal 2014, and revisions to our statements of cash flows for our first three fiscal quarters of Fiscal 2015.\nWe cannot be certain that other material weaknesses and control deficiencies will not be discovered in the future. If our efforts are not successful or other material weaknesses or control deficiencies occur in the future, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately on a timely basis or help prevent fraud, which could cause our reported financial results to be materially misstated and result in the loss of investor confidence or delisting and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nInternal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. If we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we and our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Testing and maintaining internal controls could also divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business.\nAs a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of internal control may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common shares.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley, requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, beginning with our fiscal year ended on January 1, 2017, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for as long as we remain an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to utilize the provision exempting us from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nDuring the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or other deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting once that firm begins its Section 404 audits of internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common shares could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the NASDAQ or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.", "PERMNO": 15426, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "FOGO"}
