{"cik": "945384", "company": "CICERO INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe have a history of losses and there are no assurances that such losses may not continue.\nWe experienced operating losses and net losses for each of the years from 2000 through 2014. We incurred a net loss of $3.2 million for 2013 and $3.9 million for 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we had a working capital deficit of $14.3 million. Our ability to generate positive cash flow is dependent upon sustaining certain cost reductions and generating sufficient revenues. If we are unable to generate positive cash flow, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe report of our independent auditors dated March 31, 2015 on our consolidated financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2014 included an emphasis of matter paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our auditors\u2019 doubts are based on our recurring losses from operations and working capital deficit. Our ability to continue as a going concern will be determined by our ability to secure customer contracts that will drive sufficient cash flow to sustain our operations and/or raise additional capital in the form of debt or equity financing. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur inability to obtain sufficient capital either through internally generated cash or through the use of equity or debt offerings could impair the growth of our business.\nHistorically, we have relied on equity and debt offerings, borrowings and operating cash flows to finance our working capital requirements. Reliance on internally generated cash to finance our operations could substantially limit our operational and financial flexibility. We have experienced negative cash flows from operations for the past three years. To the extent that we have insufficient operating cash flows, our ability to finance our operations may be limited by the extent to which we are able to raise capital through debt or equity financings. The extent to which we will be able to use shares of capital stock will depend on the market value of our capital stock from time to time and the willingness of potential investors to invest in our company. Using shares of capital stock for this purpose also may result in significant dilution to our then existing stockholders. Raising external capital in the form of debt could require periodic interest payments that could hinder our financial flexibility in the future. Besides, our ability to obtain external financing is subject to a number of uncertainties, including:\n\u2022 our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;\n\u2022 the state of global credit markets; and\n\u2022 general market conditions for financing activities by companies in our industry.\nOur failure to obtain a sufficient amount of capital on acceptable terms to finance our operations may materially and adversely affect the growth of our business.\nWe depend on an acceptance of our products for ongoing revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s future revenues are entirely dependent on acceptance of Cicero\u2019s products. The Company has experienced negative cash flows from operations for the past three years. At December 31, 2014, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $14.3 million. In order to generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations, the Company will need to attract more accounts in the near future.\nEconomic conditions could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause us not to achieve desired revenue.\nOur ability to generate revenue depends on the overall demand for customer experience management software and services and a recently introduced product within the enterprise mobilitymarket. Our business depends on overall economic conditions, the economic and business conditions in our target markets and the spending environment for information technology projects, and specifically for customer experience management in those markets. A weakening of the economy in one or more of our geographic regions, unanticipated major events and economic uncertainties may make the spending environment more challenging for our software and services, reduce capital spending on information technology projects by our customers and prospective customers, result in longer sales cycles for our software and services or cause customers or prospective customers to be more cautious in undertaking larger transactions. Those situations may cause a decrease in our revenue. A decrease in demand for our software and services caused, in part, by a weakening of the economy, may result in a decrease in our revenue rates.\nBecause we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of individual sales, our quarterly operating results may vary significantly, which could adversely impact our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past, and we expect they will continue to do so in the future. We have derived, and expect to continue to derive in the near term, a significant portion of our revenue from relatively large customer contracts or arrangements. The timing of revenue recognition from those contracts and arrangements has caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our operating results, particularly on a quarterly basis. Our quarterly revenues and operating results typically depend upon the volume and timing of customer contracts received during a given quarter and the percentage of each contract, which we are able to recognize as revenue during the quarter. Each of these factors is difficult to forecast. As is common in the software industry, the largest portion of software license revenues are typically recognized in the last month of each fiscal quarter and the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. We believe these patterns are partly attributable to budgeting and purchasing cycles of our customers and our sales commission policies, which compensate sales personnel for meeting or exceeding periodic quotas.\nFurthermore, licensing fees for Cicero Discovery Automation are significant and each sale can or will account for a large percentage of our revenue and a single sale may have a significant impact on the results of a quarter. In addition, the substantial commitment of executive time and financial resources that have historically been required in connection with a customer\u2019s decision to purchase our software increases the risk of quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. Our software sales require a significant commitment of time and financial resources because it is an enterprise product. Typically, the purchase of our products involves a significant technical evaluation by the customer and the delays frequently associated with customers\u2019 internal procedures to approve large capital expenditures and to test, implement and accept new technologies that affect key operations. This evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales process of several months. It also subjects the sales cycle for our products to a number of significant risks, including our customers\u2019 budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews. The length of our sales cycle may vary substantially from customer to customer.\nOur product revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the completion or commencement of significant assignments, the number of working days in a quarter and the utilization rate of services personnel. As a result of these factors, we believe that a period-to-period comparison of our historical results of operations is not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. In particular, our revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal years may not be indicative of the revenues for the first and second quarters. Moreover, if our quarterly results do not meet the expectations of our securities analysts and investors, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline.\nFailure to execute our strategies could result in impairment of goodwill, which may negatively impact profitability.\nWe have goodwill of $1.7 million as of December 31, 2014, which represents 56% of our total assets. During fiscal 2014, we recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million primarily related to goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. These valuations include management's estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve sales projections or cost savings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If the estimated fair value of our reporting unit changes in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge related to goodwill, which would reduce earnings in such period.\nLoss of key personnel associated with Cicero\u00ae development could adversely affect our business.\nLoss of key executive personnel or the software engineers we have hired with specialized knowledge of our technology could have a significant impact on our execution of our new strategy given that they have specialized knowledge developed over a long period of time with respect to our technology.\nDifferent competitive approaches or internally developed solutions to the same business problem could delay or prevent adoption of Cicero Discovery and Cicero Discovery Automation.\nCicero Discovery is designed to provide a unique way for an enterprise to understand what is truly happening on their users\u2019 desktops. To effectively penetrate the market for solutions to this problem, Cicero Discovery will compete with traditional quality assurance and desktop analytic solutions that attempt to solve this business problem. Quality assurance and desktop analytic solutions are currently sold and marketed by companies such as OpenSpan and Verint. There can be no assurance that our potential customers will determine that Cicero Discovery\u2019s methodology is superior to solutions provided by the competitors described above in addressing this business problem. Moreover, the information systems departments of our target customers, large financial institutions, are large and may elect to attempt to internally develop an internal solution to this business problem rather than to purchase the Cicero Discovery product.\nCicero Discovery Automation is designed to address in a novel way the problems that large companies face integrating the functionality of different software applications by integrating these applications at the desktop. To effectively penetrate the market for solutions to this disparate application problem, Cicero Discovery Automation will compete with traditional Enterprise Application Integration, or EAI, solutions that attempt to solve this business problem at the server or back-office level. Server level EAI solutions are currently sold and marketed by companies such as NEON, Mercator, Vitria, and BEA. There can be no assurance that our potential customers will determine that Cicero Discovery Automation\u2019s desktop integration methodology is superior to traditional middleware EAI solutions provided by the competitors described above in addressing this business problem. Moreover, the information systems departments of our target customers, large financial institutions, are large and may elect to attempt to internally develop an internal solution to this business problem rather than to purchase the Cicero Discovery Automation product.\nAccordingly, we may not be able to provide products and services that compare favorably with the products and services of our competitors or the internally developed solutions of our customers. These competitive pressures could delay or prevent adoption of Cicero Discovery or Cicero Discovery Automation or require us to reduce the price of our products, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to compete may be subject to factors outside our control.\nWe believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of competitive factors outside our control, including the ability of our competitors to hire, retain and motivate senior project managers, the ownership by competitors of software used by potential clients, the development by others of software that is competitive with our products and services, the price at which others offer comparable services and the extent of our competitors\u2019 responsiveness to customer needs.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles.\nOur future success will depend to a substantial degree upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and features that meet changing customer requirements and emerging and evolving industry standards.\nThe introduction of new or enhanced products also requires us to manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns, as well as ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop, introduce or manage the transition to new products.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, experience delays in the introduction of our products, due to factors internal and external to our business. Any future delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products, the inability of such products to gain market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could adversely affect our results of operations, particularly on a quarterly basis.\nWe believe that to fully implement our business plan we will be required to enhance our ability to work with the Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 operating systems as well as the Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system by adding additional development and consulting personnel to complement our sales plan.\nThe reputation of our software may be damaged and we may face a loss of revenue if our software products fail to perform as intended or contain significant defects.\nOur software products are complex, and significant defects may be found following introduction of new software or enhancements to existing software or in product implementations in varied information technology environments. Internal quality assurance testing and customer testing may reveal product performance issues or desirable feature enhancements that could lead us to reallocate product development resources or postpone the release of new versions of our software. The reallocation of resources or any postponement could cause delays in the development and release of future enhancements to our currently available software, require significant additional professional services work to address operational issues, damage the reputation of our software in the marketplace and result in potential loss of revenue. Although we attempt to resolve all errors that we believe would be considered serious by our partners and customers, our software is not error-free. Undetected errors or performance problems may be discovered in the future, and known errors that we consider minor may be considered serious by our partners and customers. This could result in lost revenue, delays in customer deployment or legal claims and would be detrimental to our reputation. If our software experiences performance problems or ceases to demonstrate technology leadership, we may have to increase our product development costs and divert our product development resources to address the problems.\nWe may be unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of proprietary and licensed technology.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon our proprietary and licensed technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law, contractual restrictions and passwords to protect our proprietary technology. However, these measures provide only limited protection, and there is no guarantee that our protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate. Furthermore, the laws of some jurisdictions outside the United States do not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar technology; duplicate our products or design around our patents or our other intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect or police the unauthorized use of our products or technology, and litigation may be required in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Any litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights would be expensive and time-consuming, would divert management resources and may not be adequate to protect our business.\nWe do not believe any of our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties. However, companies in the software industry have experienced substantial litigation regarding intellectual property and third parties could assert claims that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be required to indemnify our distribution partners and end-users for similar claims made against them. Any claims against us would divert management resources, and could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation, pay damages, develop new intellectual property or acquire licenses to intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claims. These licenses, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms. As a result, intellectual property claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAs the number of software products in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps, we believe that software developers and licensors may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely impacted if we do not provide professional services to implement our solutions.\nCustomers that license our software typically engage our professional services staff or third-party consultants to assist with product implementation, training and other professional consulting services. We believe that many of our software sales depend, in part, on our ability to provide our customers with these services and to attract and educate third-party consultants to provide similar services. New professional services personnel and service providers require training and education and take time and significant resources to reach full productivity. Competition for qualified personnel and service providers is intense within our industry. Our business may be harmed if we are unable to provide professional services to our customers to effectively implement our solutions or if we are unable to establish and maintain relationships with third-party implementation providers.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by cyber security breach.\nThird parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose sensitive information such as user names, passwords, or other information in order to gain access to our data, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and a loss of confidence in the security of our service that would harm our future business prospects. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers.\nBecause our software could interfere with the operations of customers, we may be subject to potential product liability and warranty claims by these customers.\nOur software enables customers\u2019 software applications to integrate and is often used for mission critical functions or applications. Errors, defects or other performance problems in our software or failure to provide technical support could result in financial or other damages to our customers. Customers could seek damages for losses from us. In addition, the failure of our software and solutions to perform to customers\u2019 expectations could give rise to warranty claims. The integration of our software with our customer\u2019s applications increase the risk that a customer may bring a lawsuit against us. Even if our software is not at fault, a product liability claim brought against us, even if not successful, could be time consuming and costly to defend and could harm our reputation.\nThe so-called \u201cpenny stock rule\u201d could make it cumbersome for brokers and dealers to trade in our common stock, making the market for our common stock less liquid which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Trading of our common stock on the OTCBB may be subject to certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, commonly referred to as the \"penny stock\" rule. A penny stock is generally defined to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our stock is currently a penny stock and therefore is subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers. These may require a broker-dealer to:\n\u00b7\nmake a special suitability determination for purchasers of our shares;\n\u00b7\nreceive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase; and\n\u00b7\ndeliver to a prospective purchaser of our stock, prior to the first transaction, a risk disclosure document relating to the penny stock market.\nConsequently, penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade and/or maintain a market in our common stock. Also, prospective investors may not want to get involved with the additional administrative requirements, which may have a material adverse effect on the trading of our shares.\nWe have not paid any dividends on our common stock and it is likely that no dividends will be paid in the future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nProvisions of our charter and Bylaws could deter takeover attempts.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance, without stockholder approval, of preferred stock, with such designations, rights and preferences as the Board of Directors may determine from time to time. Such designations, rights and preferences established by the Board may adversely affect our stockholders. In the event of issuance, the preferred stock could be used, under certain circumstances, as a means of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock in addition to the currently outstanding preferred stock, we may issue preferred stock in the future.\nSome of the rights granted to the holders of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock could prevent a potential acquirer from buying our Company.\nHolders of our Series A-1 and Series B Preferred Stock have the right to block the Company from consummating a merger, sale of all or substantially all of its assets or recapitalization. Accordingly, the holder of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock could prevent the consummation of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the current market price for their shares.", "PERMNO": 81849, "SIC": 7371, "TIC": "CICN"}
