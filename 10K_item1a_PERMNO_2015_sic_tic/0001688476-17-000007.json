Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nDescribed below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing, and consequently, the market value of our common stock. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance. The risks described below are those that we have identified as material and is not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face. There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business is cyclical and depends on spending and well completions by the onshore oil and natural gas industry in the U.S., and the level of such activity is volatile. Our business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by industry conditions that are beyond our control.\nOur business is cyclical, and we depend on the willingness of our customers to make expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas from onshore unconventional resources in the U.S. The willingness of our customers to undertake these activities depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022 prices, and expectations about future prices, for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 domestic and foreign supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas and related products;\n\u2022 the level of global and domestic oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\nthe supply of and demand for hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield services and equipment in the United States;\n\u2022 the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 available pipeline, storage and other transportation capacity;\n\u2022 lead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022 the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield service activities, as well as exploration and production activities, including public pressure on governmental bodies and regulatory agencies to regulate our industry;\n\u2022\nthe availability of water resources, suitable proppant and chemicals in sufficient quantities for use in hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022 geopolitical developments and political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022\nactions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, its members and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022 the price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources;\n\u2022 weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nuncertainty in capital and commodities markets and the ability of oil and natural gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing; and\n\u2022 U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. governmental regulations and taxes.\nThe volatility of the oil and natural gas industry and the resulting impact on exploration and production activity could adversely impact the level of drilling and completion activity by some of our customers. This volatility may result in a decline in the demand for our services or adversely affect the price of our services. In addition, material declines in oil and natural gas prices, or drilling or completion activity in the U.S. oil and natural gas shale regions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, a decrease in the development of oil and natural gas reserves in our market areas may also have an adverse impact on our business, even in an environment of strong oil and natural gas prices.\nOur business may be adversely affected by a deterioration in general economic conditions or a weakening of the broader energy industry.\nA prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the U.S., adverse events relating to the energy industry or regional, national and global economic conditions and factors, particularly a further slowdown in the E&P industry, could negatively impact our operations and therefore adversely affect our results. The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession because such periods may be accompanied by decreased exploration and development spending by our customers, decreased demand for oil and gas and decreased prices for oil and gas.\nA decline in or substantial volatility of crude oil and natural gas commodity prices could adversely affect the demand for our services.\nThe demand for our services is substantially influenced by current and anticipated crude oil and natural gas commodity prices and the related level of drilling and completion activity and general production spending in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility or weakness in crude oil and natural gas commodity prices (or the perception that crude oil and natural gas commodity prices will decrease) affects the spending patterns of our customers and the products and services we provide are, to a substantial extent, deferrable in the event oil and natural gas companies reduce capital expenditures. As a result, we may experience lower utilization of, and may be forced to lower our rates for, our equipment and services.\nHistorical prices for crude oil and natural gas have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile. For example, since 1999, oil prices have ranged from as low as approximately $10 per barrel to over $100 per barrel. The spot price per barrel as of December 31, 2016 was $53.75. In recent years, oil and natural gas prices and, therefore, the level of exploration, development and production activity, have experienced a sustained decline from the highs in the latter half of 2014, as a result of an increasing global supply of oil and a decision by OPEC to sustain its production levels in spite of the decline in oil prices, as well as slowing economic growth in the Eurozone and China. Since November 2014, prices for U.S. oil have weakened in response to continued high levels of production by OPEC, a buildup in inventories and lower global demand. As a result of the significant decline in the price of oil, beginning in late 2014, E&P companies moved to significantly cut costs, both by decreasing drilling and completion activity and by demanding price concessions from their service providers, including providers of hydraulic fracturing services. In turn, service providers, including hydraulic fracturing service providers, were forced to lower their operating costs and capital expenditures, while continuing to operate their businesses in an extremely competitive environment. In November 2016, OPEC announced its agreement to a framework for limiting crude output; however, the global supply excess may persist if OPEC member countries do not adhere to the production caps or if non-OPEC member countries increase production in response to increasing oil prices. Prolonged periods of price instability in the oil and natural gas industry will adversely affect the demand for our products and services and our financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the commercial development of economically viable alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar geothermal, tidal, fuel cells and biofuels) could reduce demand for our services and create downward pressure on the revenue we are able to derive from such services, as they are dependent on oil and natural gas commodity prices.\nFuel conservation measures could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the energy services industry.\nRisks inherent to our industry can cause personal injury, loss of life, suspension of or impact upon operations, damage to geological formations, damage to facilities, business interruption and damage to, or destruction of, property, equipment and the environment. Such risks may include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 equipment defects;\n\u2022 vehicle accidents;\n\u2022 explosions and uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids;\n\u2022 unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures and industrial accidents;\n\u2022 blowouts;\n\u2022 cratering;\n\u2022 loss of well control;\n\u2022 collapse of the borehole; and\n\u2022 damaged or lost drilling equipment.\nIn addition, our hydraulic fracturing and well completion services could become a source of spills or releases of fluids, including chemicals used during hydraulic fracturing activities, at the site where such services are performed, or could result in the discharge of such fluids into underground formations that were not targeted for fracturing or well completion activities, such as potable aquifers. These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages and could result in a variety of claims, losses and remedial obligations that could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The existence, frequency and severity of such incidents could affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. In particular, our customers may elect not to purchase our services if they view our safety record as unacceptable, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenue, and any litigation or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation with our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nWe may be subject to claims for personal injury and property damage, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nOur services are subject to inherent risks that can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment or the suspension of our operations. Our operations are subject to, and exposed to, employee/employer liabilities and risks such as wrongful termination, discrimination, labor organizing, retaliation claims and general human resource related matters. Litigation arising from operations where our facilities are located, or our services are provided, may cause us to be named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims including claims for exemplary damages. We maintain what we believe is\ncustomary and reasonable insurance to protect our business against these potential losses, but such insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities, and we are not fully insured against all risks. Further, our insurance has deductibles or self-insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions. The current trend in the insurance industry is towards larger deductibles and self-insured retentions. In addition, insurance may not be available in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and commercially justifiable, compelling us to have larger deductibles or self-insured retentions to effectively manage expenses. As a result, we could become subject to material uninsured liabilities or situations where we have high deductibles or self-insured retentions that expose us to liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nLitigation and Other Proceedings Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Business.\nThe nature of our business makes us susceptible to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time. In addition, during periods of depressed market conditions, such as the one we have been experiencing, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers, vendors, current and former employees and others initiating legal proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any legal proceedings or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nOn November 4, 2016, a former employee of Keane filed a complaint for a proposed class or collective action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entitled Meals v. Keane Frac GP, LLC, et al., alleging that certain field professionals were not properly classified under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d) and Pennsylvania law. We filed our answer on November 30, 2016 denying the material allegations of the complaint, and on March 16, 2017 plaintiff filed a motion for conditional certification of a collective action. On December 27, 2016, two former employees filed a complaint for a proposed class or collective action in United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas entitled Hickson and Villa v. Keane Group Holdings, LLC, et al., alleging certain field professionals were not properly classified under the FLSA and Pennsylvania law. We filed our answer on February 3, 2017 denying the material allegations of the complaint. We are currently unable to estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters.\nCompetition within the oilfield services industry may adversely affect our ability to market our services.\nThe oilfield services industry is highly competitive and fragmented and includes several large companies that compete in many of the markets we serve, as well as numerous small companies that compete with us on a local basis. Our larger competitors\u2019 greater resources could allow them to better withstand industry downturns and to compete more effectively on the basis of technology, geographic scope and retained skilled personnel. We believe the principal competitive factors in the market areas we serve are price, equipment quality, supply chains, balance sheet strength and financial condition, product and service quality, safety record, availability of crews and equipment and technical proficiency. Our operations may be adversely affected if our current competitors or new market entrants introduce new products or services with better features, performance, prices or other characteristics than our products and services or expand into service areas where we operate. Competitive pressures or other factors may also result in significant price competition, particularly during industry downturns, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Significant increases in overall market capacity have previously caused price competition and led to lower pricing and utilization levels for our services.\nThe competitive environment has intensified since late 2014 as a result of the industry downturn and oversupply of oilfield services. We have seen substantial reductions in the prices we can charge for our services based on reduced demand and resulting overcapacity. Any significant future increase in overall market capacity for completion services could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nNew technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent or other intellectual property protections. Although we believe our equipment and processes currently give us a competitive advantage, as competitors and\nothers use or develop new or comparable technologies in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to develop, implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that may allow them to enjoy technological advantages and develop and implement new products on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop and implement all new technologies or products on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. Limits on our ability to develop, effectively use and implement new and emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nOur assets require significant amounts of capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment and may require significant capital expenditures for new equipment.\nOur hydraulic fracturing fleets and other completion service-related equipment require significant capital investment in maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment to maintain their competitiveness. For example, from April 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, we commissioned seven hydraulic fracturing fleets to service customers at a total cost of approximately $11.0 million, including capital expenditures. Based on current component and labor costs, we believe that our remaining inactive hydraulic fracturing fleets can be made operational at a cost of less than $2.0 million per fleet. However, the costs of components and labor have increased in the past and may increase in the future with increases in demand, which will require us to incur additional costs to make our remaining active fleets operational. Our fleets and other equipment typically do not generate revenue while they are undergoing maintenance, refurbishment or upgrades. Any maintenance, upgrade or refurbishment project for our assets could increase our indebtedness or reduce cash available for other opportunities. Further, such projects may require proportionally greater capital investments as a percentage of total asset value, which may make such projects difficult to finance on acceptable terms. To the extent we are unable to fund such projects, we may have less equipment available for service or our equipment may not be attractive to potential or current customers. Additionally, competition or advances in technology within our industry may require us to update or replace existing fleets or build or acquire new fleets. Such demands on our capital or reductions in demand for our hydraulic fracturing fleets and other completion service related equipment and the increase in cost to maintain labor necessary for such maintenance and improvement, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations and may increase the cost to make our inactive fleets operational.\nWe are dependent on a few customers in a single industry. The loss of one or more significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nOur customers are engaged in the oil and natural gas E&P business in the U.S. Historically, we have been dependent upon a few customers for a significant portion of our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top three customers, Shell Exploration & Production, XTO Energy and Seneca Resources Corporation, collectively accounted for approximately 48% of total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our top four customers, EQT Production Company, Shell Exploration & Production, XTO Energy and Southwestern Energy Company, collectively accounted for approximately 90% of total revenues.\nOur business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our significant customers ceases to engage us for our services on favorable terms or at all or fails to pay or delays in paying us significant amounts of our outstanding receivables. Although we do have contracts for multiple projects with certain of our customers, most of our services are provided on a project-by-project basis.\nAdditionally, the E&P industry is characterized by frequent consolidation activity. Changes in ownership of our customers may result in the loss of, or reduction in, business from those customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, many of whose operations are concentrated solely in the domestic E&P industry which, as described above, is subject to\nvolatility and, therefore, credit risk. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully reduce customer credit risk. If we are unable to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise use our equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and/or results of operations.\nOur commitments under supply agreements could exceed our requirements, and our reliance on suppliers exposes us to risks including price, timing of delivery and quality of products and services upon which our business relies.\nWe have purchase commitments with certain vendors to supply a majority of the proppant used in our operations. Some of these agreements are take-or-pay agreements with minimum purchase obligations. If demand for our hydraulic fracturing services decreases from current levels, demand for the raw materials and products we supply as part of these services will also decrease. If demand decreases enough, we could have contractual minimum commitments that exceed the required amount of goods we need to supply to our customers. In this instance, we could be required to purchase goods that we do not have a present need for, pay for goods that we do not take delivery of or pay prices in excess of market prices at the time of purchase. Additionally, our reliance on outside suppliers for some of the key materials and equipment we use in providing our services involves risks, including limited control over the price, timely delivery and quality of such materials or equipment.\nUnexpected and immediate changes in the availability and pricing of raw materials, or the loss of or interruption in operations of one or more of our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, prospects and financial condition.\nRaw materials essential to our business are normally readily available. However, high levels of demand for raw materials, such as gels, guar, proppant and hydrochloric acid, have triggered constraints in the supply chain of those raw materials and could dramatically increase the prices of such raw materials. For example, during 2012, companies in our industry experienced a shortage of guar, which is a key ingredient in fracturing fluids. This shortage resulted in an unexpected and immediate increase in the price of guar. During 2008, our industry faced sporadic proppant shortages requiring work stoppages, which adversely impacted the operating results of several competitors. We may not be able to mitigate any future shortages of raw materials.\nThe proppant market is a highly competitive and volatile part of the supply chain on which our industry depends.\nAlthough the scarcity of proppant and chemicals at various periods between 2011 and 2014 has largely been reversed as a result of increased manufacturing efficiency, expanded capacity and decreased demand, the proppant market remains highly competitive and relatively volatile. An increase in the cost of proppant as a result of increased demand or a decrease in the number of proppant providers as a result of consolidation could increase our cost of an essential raw material in hydraulic stimulation and have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects and financial condition.\nWe may record losses or impairment charges related to idle assets or assets that we sell.\nProlonged periods of low utilization, changes in technology or the sale of assets below their carrying value may cause us to experience losses. These events could result in the recognition of impairment charges that increase our net loss. Prior to our acquisition of the Acquired Trican Operations, Trican recorded significant impairment charges, and we may record significant impairment charges in the future. Significant impairment charges as a result of a decline in market conditions or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods.\nCompetition among oilfield service and equipment providers is affected by each provider\u2019s reputation for safety and quality.\nOur activities are subject to a wide range of national, state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, customers maintain their own compliance and reporting requirements. Failure to comply with these health and safety laws and regulations, or failure to comply with our customers\u2019 compliance or\nreporting requirements, could tarnish our reputation for safety and quality and have a material adverse effect on our competitive position.\nOilfield anti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party\u2019s indemnification of us.\nWe typically enter into agreements with our customers governing the provision of our services, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. Such agreements may require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity agreements, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as \u201coilfield anti-indemnity acts\u201d expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such oilfield anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party\u2019s indemnification of us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding issues of health, safety and protection of the environment. Under these laws and regulations, we may become liable for penalties, damages or costs of remediation or other corrective measures. Any changes in laws or government regulations could increase our costs of doing business.\nOur operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and tribal laws and regulations relating to, among other things, protection of natural resources, clean air and drinking water, wetlands, endangered species, greenhouse gasses, nonattainment areas, the environment, health and safety, chemical use and storage, waste management, waste disposal and transportation of waste and other hazardous and nonhazardous materials. Our operations involve risks of environmental liability, including leakage from an operator\u2019s casing during our operations or accidental spills onto or into surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, joint and several liability, or both. In some situations, we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, third parties without regard to whether we caused or contributed to the conditions. Additionally, environmental concerns, including clean air, drinking water contamination and seismic activity, have prompted investigations that could lead to the enactment of regulations, limitations, restrictions or moratoria that could potentially have a material adverse impact on our business. Actions arising under these laws and regulations could result in the shutdown of our operations, fines and penalties (administrative, civil or criminal), revocations of permits to conduct business, expenditures for remediation or other corrective measures and/or claims for liability for property damage, exposure to hazardous materials, exposure to hazardous waste, nuisance or personal injuries. Sanctions for noncompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may also include the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, revocation of permits and temporary or permanent cessation of operations in a particular location and issuance of corrective action orders. Such claims or sanctions and related costs could cause us to incur substantial costs or losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. Additionally, an increase in regulatory requirements, limitations, restrictions or moratoria on oil and natural gas exploration and completion activities at a federal, state or local level could significantly delay or interrupt our operations, limit the amount of work we can perform, increase our costs of compliance, or increase the cost of our services, thereby possibly having a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nIf we do not perform in accordance with government, industry, customer or our own health, safety and environmental standards, we could lose business from our customers, many of whom have an increased focus on environmental and safety issues.\nWe are subject to the EPA, U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Nuclear Regulation Commission, OSHA and state regulatory agencies that regulate operations to prevent air, soil and water pollution. The energy extraction sector is one of the sectors designated for increased enforcement by the EPA, which will continue to regulate our industry in the years to come, potentially resulting in additional regulations that could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects or financial condition.\nThe EPA regulates air emissions from all engines, including off-road diesel engines that are used by us to power equipment in the field. Under these U.S. emission control regulations, we could be limited in the number of\ncertain off-road diesel engines we can purchase. Further, the emission control and fuel quality regulations could result in increased costs.\nLaws and regulations protecting the environment generally have become more stringent over time, and we expect them to continue to do so. This could lead to material increases in our costs, and liability exposure, for future environmental compliance and remediation. Additionally, if we expand the size or scope of our operations, we could be subject to existing regulations that are more stringent than the requirements under which we are currently allowed to operate or require additional authorizations to continue operations. Compliance with this additional regulatory burden could increase our operating or other costs.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could prohibit, restrict or limit hydraulic fracturing operations, could increase our operating costs or could result in the disclosure of proprietary information resulting in competitive harm.\nDuring recent sessions of the U.S. Congress, several pieces of legislation were introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives for the purpose of amending environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act, the SDWA and the Toxic Substance Control Act with respect to activities associated with extraction and energy production industries, especially the oil and gas industry. Furthermore, various items of legislation and rulemaking have been proposed that would regulate or prevent federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing on federally owned land. Proposed rulemaking from the EPA and OSHA, such as the proposed regulation relating to respirable silica sand, could increase our regulatory requirements, which could increase our costs of compliance or increase the costs of our services, thereby possibly having a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIf the EPA or another federal or state-level agency asserts jurisdiction over certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing operations, an additional level of regulation established at the federal or state level could lead to operational delays and increase our costs. The EPA recently issued a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. The EPA report states that there is scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking resources under some circumstances, and identifies certain conditions in which the EPA believes the impact of such activities on drinking water and groundwater can be more frequent or severe. The EPA study could spur further initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. Many regulatory and legislative bodies routinely evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of laws and regulations affecting the oil and gas industry. As a result, state legislatures, state regulatory agencies and local municipalities may consider legislation, regulations or ordinances, respectively, that could affect all aspects of the oil and natural gas industry and occasionally take action to restrict or further regulate hydraulic fracturing operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of these state and municipal actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations affecting hydraulic fracturing. Compliance, stricter regulations or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nMany states in which we operate require the disclosure of some or all of the chemicals used in our hydraulic fracturing operations. Certain aspects of one or more of these chemicals may be considered proprietary by us or our chemical suppliers. Disclosure of our proprietary chemical information to third parties or to the public, even if inadvertent, could diminish the value of our trade secrets or those of our chemical suppliers and could result in competitive harm to us, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nWe are also aware that some states, counties and municipalities have enacted or are considering moratoria on hydraulic fracturing. For example, New York and Vermont have banned or are in the process of banning the use of high volume hydraulic fracturing. Alternatively, some municipalities are or have considered zoning and other ordinances, the conditions of which could impose a de facto ban on drilling and/or hydraulic fracturing operations. Further, some states, counties and municipalities are closely examining water use issues, such as permit and disposal options for processed water, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, prospects and results of operations if such additional permitting requirements are imposed upon our industry. Additionally, our business could be affected by a moratorium or increased regulation of companies in our supply chain, such as sand mining by our proppant suppliers, which could limit our access to supplies and increase the costs of our raw\nmaterials. At this time, it is not possible to estimate how these various restrictions could affect our ongoing operations. For more information, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Environmental Regulation.\u201d\nExisting or future laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business and may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, prospects and financial condition.\nChanges in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gases and climate change may negatively impact demand for our services. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements, including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns. Federal, state and local agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, sequestration and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, prospects and financial condition.\nWe use intellectual property relating to hydraulic fracturing fluids and electronic pump control which is subject to non-exclusive license arrangements and may be licensed to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business.\nTrican has licensed our use of certain of its hydraulic fracturing fluids and electronic pump control technology under non-exclusive agreements. Accordingly, Trican has the right to license the same technologies and fracturing fluids that we use in our operations to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business. The rights obtained under this license may be shared with others who have been granted a similar non-exclusive license. As a result, the non-exclusive nature of this license may lead to conflicts between us and others granted similar rights.\nIf we are unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights, we may suffer a loss in our competitive advantage or market share.\nWe do not have patents or patent applications relating to many of our key processes and technology. If we are not able to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets, or if our competitors are able to replicate our technology or services, our competitive advantage would be diminished. We also cannot assure you that any patents we may obtain in the future would provide us with any significant commercial benefit or would allow us to prevent our competitors from employing comparable technologies or processes.\nWe may be subject to interruptions or failures in our information technology systems.\nWe rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support our business, including process control technology. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, usage errors by employees, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other security breaches, or similar events. The failure of any of our information technology systems may cause disruptions in our operations, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nChanges in transportation regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to various transportation regulations including as a motor carrier by the U.S. Department of Transportation and by various federal, state and tribal agencies, whose regulations include certain permit requirements of highway and safety authorities. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers over our trucking operations, generally governing such matters as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, equipment testing, driver requirements and specifications and insurance requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations, such as changes in fuel\nemissions limits, hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period and limits on vehicle weight and size. As the federal government continues to develop and propose regulations relating to fuel quality, engine efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, we may experience an increase in costs related to truck purchases and maintenance, impairment of equipment productivity, a decrease in the residual value of vehicles, unpredictable fluctuations in fuel prices and an increase in operating expenses. Increased truck traffic may contribute to deteriorating road conditions in some areas where our operations are performed. Our operations, including routing and weight restrictions, could be affected by road construction, road repairs, detours and state and local regulations and ordinances restricting access to certain roads. Proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, are also made from time to time, and any such increase would increase our operating costs. Also, state and local regulation of permitted routes and times on specific roadways could adversely affect our operations. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes or municipal ordinances applicable to our logistics operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.\nWe may be unable to employ a sufficient number of key employees, technical personnel and other skilled or qualified workers.\nThe delivery of our services and products requires personnel with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the volatility in the energy service industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment with our competitors or in fields that offer a more desirable work environment. Our ability to be productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers. In addition, our ability to further expand our operations according to geographic demand for our services depends in part on our ability to relocate or increase the size of our skilled labor force. The demand for skilled workers in our areas of operations can be high, the supply may be limited and we may be unable to relocate our employees from areas of lower utilization to areas of higher demand. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. Further, a significant decrease in the wages paid by us or our competitors as a result of reduced industry demand could result in a reduction of the available skilled labor force, and there is no assurance that the availability of skilled labor will improve following a subsequent increase in demand for our services or an increase in wage rates. If any of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nWe depend heavily on the efforts of executive officers, managers and other key employees to manage our operations. The unexpected loss or unavailability of key members of management or technical personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nWe may be unable to maintain key employees, technical personnel and other skilled or qualified workers due to immigration enforcement action or related loss.\nWe require full compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and other laws concerning immigration and the hiring of legally documented workers. We recognize that foreign nationals may be a valuable source of talent, but that not all foreign nationals are authorized to work for U.S. companies immediately. In some cases, it may be necessary to obtain a required work authorization from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or similar government agency prior to a foreign national working as an employee for us. Although we do not know of any issues with our employees, we could lose an employee or be subject to an enforcement action that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nAdverse weather conditions could impact demand for our services or materially impact our costs.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by adverse weather conditions. For example, unusually warm winters could adversely affect the demand for our services by decreasing the demand for natural gas or unusually cold winters could adversely affect our ability to perform our services, for example, due to delays in the delivery of products that we need to provide our services. Our operations in arid regions can be affected by droughts and limited access to water used in our hydraulic fracturing operations. Adverse weather can also directly impede our own operations. Repercussions of adverse weather conditions may include:\n\u2022 curtailment of services;\n\u2022 weather-related damage to facilities and equipment, resulting in delays in operations;\n\u2022\ninability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; and\n\u2022 loss of productivity.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States could adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations. We could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from payors or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets if wells, operations sites or other related facilities are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Such activities could reduce the overall demand for oil and gas, which, in turn, could also reduce the demand for our products and services. Terrorist activities and the threat of potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies.\nDelays in obtaining, or inability to obtain or renew, permits or authorizations by our customers for their operations or by us for our operations could impair our business.\nIn most states, our customers are required to obtain permits or authorizations from one or more governmental agencies or other third parties to perform drilling and completion activities, including hydraulic fracturing. Such permits or approvals are typically required by state agencies, but can also be required by federal and local governmental agencies or other third parties. The requirements for such permits or authorizations vary depending on the location where such drilling and completion activities will be conducted. As with most permitting and authorization processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit or approval to be issued and the conditions which may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. In some jurisdictions, such as New York State and within the jurisdiction of the Delaware River Basin Commission, certain regulatory authorities have delayed or suspended the issuance of permits or authorizations while the potential environmental impacts associated with issuing such permits can be studied and appropriate mitigation measures evaluated. In Texas, rural water districts have begun to impose restrictions on water use and may require permits for water used in drilling and completion activities. Permitting, authorization or renewal delays, the inability to obtain new permits or the revocation of current permits could cause a loss of revenue and potentially have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nWe are also required to obtain federal, state, local and/or third-party permits and authorizations in some jurisdictions in connection with our wireline services. These permits, when required, impose certain conditions on our operations. Any changes in these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in identifying and making acquisitions.\nPart of our strategy to expand our geographic scope and customer relationships, increase our access to technology and to grow our business is dependent on our ability to make acquisitions that result in accretive revenues and earnings. We may be unable to make accretive acquisitions or realize expected benefits of any acquisitions for any of the following reasons:\n\u2022 failure to identify attractive targets;\n\u2022\nincorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets;\n\u2022 failure to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all;\n\u2022 restrictions in our debt agreements;\n\u2022 failure to successfully integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets;\n\u2022 failure to retain or attract key employees; and\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations or other priorities.\nOur acquisition strategy requires that we successfully integrate acquired companies into our business practices as well as our procurement, management and enterprise-wide information technology systems. We may not be successful in implementing our business practices at acquired companies, and our acquisitions could face difficulty in transitioning from their previous information technology systems to our own. Furthermore, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations of management are combined. Any such difficulties, or increased costs associated with such integration, could affect our business, financial performance and operations.\nIf we are unable to identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, it could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nIntegrating acquisitions may be time-consuming and create costs that could reduce our net income and cash flows.\nPart of our strategy includes pursuing acquisitions that we believe will be accretive to our business. If we consummate an acquisition, the process of integrating the acquired business may be complex and time consuming, may be disruptive to the business and may cause an interruption of, or a distraction of management\u2019s attention from, the business as a result of a number of obstacles, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 a failure of our due diligence process to identify significant risks or issues;\n\u2022 the loss of customers of the acquired company or our company;\n\u2022 negative impact on the brands or banners of the acquired company or our company;\n\u2022 a failure to maintain or improve the quality of customer service;\n\u2022 difficulties assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022 our inability to retain key personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022 the incurrence of unexpected expenses and working capital requirements;\n\u2022 our inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals, including synergies, for the combined businesses;\n\u2022 difficulty in maintaining internal controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022 mistaken assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt; and\n\u2022 unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas.\nAny of the foregoing obstacles, or a combination of them, could decrease gross profit margins or increase selling, general and administrative expenses in absolute terms and/or as a percentage of net sales, which could in turn negatively impact our net income and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to consummate acquisitions in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, future acquisitions are accompanied by the risk that the obligations and liabilities of an acquired company may not be adequately reflected in the historical financial statements of that company and the risk that those historical financial statements may be based on assumptions which are incorrect or inconsistent with our assumptions or approach to accounting policies. Any of these material obligations, liabilities or incorrect or inconsistent assumptions could adversely impact our results of operations, prospects and financial condition.\nOur historical financial statements may not be indicative of future performance.\nIn light of the Trican transaction completed in March 2016, our operating results only reflect the impact of the acquisition for dates after the closing of the transaction, and, therefore, comparisons with prior periods are difficult. As a result, our limited historical financial performance as the owner of the Acquired Trican Operations may make it difficult for stockholders to evaluate our business and results of operations to date and to assess our future prospects and viability.\nFurthermore, as a result of the implementation of new business initiatives and strategies following the completion of the Trican transaction, our historical results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our ongoing operations and the operating results to be expected in the future.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the application of the use of our net proceeds received upon completion of the IPO on January 25, 2017, we had $138.8 million of debt outstanding (not including capital lease obligations).\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect the market price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to interest rate increases and general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service requirements and other general corporate requirements; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nIn addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt or that we will be able to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms. If we were unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as:\n\u2022\nsales of assets;\n\u2022\nsales of equity; or\n\u2022\nnegotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt.\nOur debt instruments may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to use some of our options.\nDespite our significant indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur additional debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the credit agreements that govern the New ABL Facility and the New Term Loan Facility (together with the New ABL Facility, the \u201cSenior Secured Debt Facilities\u201d) permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to certain limitations. If new indebtedness is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the related risks that we and they now face would intensify. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Principal Debt Agreements.\u201d\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain operating covenants and restrictions that limit our operations and could lead to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with them.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain operating covenants and other restrictions relating to, among other things, limitations on indebtedness (including guarantees of additional indebtedness) and liens, mergers, consolidations and dissolutions, sales of assets, investments and acquisitions, dividends and other restricted payments, repurchase of shares of capital stock and options to purchase shares of capital stock and certain transactions with affiliates. In addition, our Senior Secured Debt Facilities include certain financial covenants.\nThe restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business, and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility.\nFailure to comply with these financial and operating covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the pricing of our products, our success at implementing cost reduction initiatives, our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy or changes in general economic conditions, which may be beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the agreements that govern these facilities that would permit the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable to repay such amounts, lenders having secured obligations could proceed against the collateral securing these obligations. The collateral includes the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries and substantially all of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 other tangible and intangible assets, subject in each case to certain exceptions. This could have serious consequences on our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent. In addition, these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our business and stockholders.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Principal Debt Agreements\u201d for additional information.\nIncreases in interest rates could negatively affect our financing costs and our ability to access capital.\nWe have exposure to future interest rates based on the variable rate debt under the Senior Secured Debt Facilities and to the extent we raise additional debt in the capital markets to meet maturing debt obligations, to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs and to finance future acquisitions. Daily working capital requirements are typically financed with operational cash flow and through the use of various committed lines of credit. The interest rate on these borrowing arrangements is generally determined from the inter-bank offering rate at the borrowing date plus a pre-set margin. Although we employ risk management techniques to hedge against interest rate volatility, significant and sustained increases in market interest rates could materially increase our financing costs and negatively impact our reported results.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nKeane Investor and our Sponsor control us and may have conflicts of interest with other stockholders in the future.\nKeane Investor controls approximately 70% of our common stock. As a result, Keane Investor is able to control the election of our directors, determine our corporate and management policies and determine, without the consent of our other stockholders, the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. Seven of our 11 directors are employees of, appointees of, or advisors to, members of Cerberus, as described under \u201cItem 10. Directors, Officers and Corporate Governance.\u201d Cerberus, through Keane Investor, will\nalso have sufficient voting power to amend our organizational documents. The interests of Cerberus may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, Cerberus is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Cerberus may also pursue, for its own members\u2019 accounts, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as Cerberus continues to own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock through Keane Investor, Cerberus will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions.\nWe are restricted from competing with Trican in the oilfield services business in Canada, which may adversely affect our access to, or our ability to expand within, the Canadian market.\nWe agreed to a non-competition provision with Trican as part our acquisition of the Acquired Trican Operations, pursuant to which, subject to certain limited exceptions, we may not compete, directly or indirectly, with Trican in Canada in the oilfield services business through March 16, 2018. Subject to certain limited exceptions, we also may not own an interest in any entity that competes directly or indirectly with Trican in Canada, other than with respect to any industrial services or completion tools business or certain interests in companies with limited revenues derived from Canadian operations. These restrictions may adversely affect our access to or ability to expand within the Canadian market. Additionally, Trican has an ownership interest in Keane Investor, and conflicts of interest may therefore arise between Trican and our other shareholders relating to opportunities to enter into or expand within the Canadian oilfield business.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we have not incurred as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and related rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). We will incur ongoing periodic expenses in connection with the administration of our organizational structure. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. In estimating these costs, we took into account expenses related to insurance, legal, accounting, and compliance activities, as well as other expenses not currently incurred. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) rules and, as a result, qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nKeane Investor controls a majority of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE rules. Under the NYSE rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022 the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022 the requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022 the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022 the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWe currently utilize, and intend to continue to utilize these exemptions. As a result, we do not have a majority of independent directors nor do our nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nTaking advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during fiscal 2016, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:\n\u2022 we are not required to engage an auditor to report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022 we are not required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);\n\u2022 we are not required to submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as \u201csay-on-pay,\u201d \u201csay-on-frequency\u201d and \u201csay-on-golden parachutes\u201d; and\n\u2022 we are not required to disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer\u2019s compensation to median employee compensation.\nWe may take advantage of these provisions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of June 30, 2017, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nThe JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company like us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have chosen to irrevocably \u201copt out\u201d of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards as required when they are adopted.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we elect to rely on these exemptions, or if taking advantage of these exemptions would result in less active trading or more volatility in the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents, certain agreements governing our indebtedness, the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement and Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that some stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions\ncould also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, possibly depressing the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace members of our management team. Examples of such provisions are as follows:\n\u2022 from and after such date that Keane Investor and its respective Affiliates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)), or any person who is an express assignee or designee of Keane Investor\u2019s respective rights under our certificate of incorporation (and such assignee\u2019s or designee\u2019s Affiliates) (of these entities, the entity that is the beneficial owner of the largest number of shares is referred to as the \u201cDesignated Controlling Stockholder\u201d) ceases to own, in the aggregate, at least 50% of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock (the \u201c50% Trigger Date\u201d), the authorized number of our directors may be increased or decreased only by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock or by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022 prior to the 50% Trigger Date, only our board of directors and the Designated Controlling Stockholder are expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws and, from and after the 50% Trigger Date, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of at least two-thirds of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote;\n\u2022 from and after the 50% Trigger Date, the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board will be limited;\n\u2022 from and after the 50% Trigger Date, stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and actions by our stockholders by written consent will be prohibited;\n\u2022 from and after such date that Keane Investor and its respective Affiliates (or any person who is an express assignee or designee of Keane Investor\u2019s respective rights under our certificate of incorporation (and such assignee\u2019s or designee\u2019s Affiliates)) ceases to own, in the aggregate, at least 35% of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock (the \u201c35% Trigger Date\u201d), advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors will be established;\n\u2022 limits on who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022 requirements on any stockholder (or group of stockholders acting in concert), other than, prior to the 35% Trigger Date, the Designated Controlling Stockholder, who seeks to transact business at a meeting or nominate directors for election to submit a list of derivative interests in any of our company\u2019s securities, including any short interests and synthetic equity interests held by such proposing stockholder;\n\u2022 requirements on any stockholder (or group of stockholders acting in concert) who seeks to nominate directors for election to submit a list of \u201crelated party transactions\u201d with the proposed nominee(s) (as if such nominating person were a registrant pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K, and the proposed nominee was an executive officer or director of the \u201cregistrant\u201d); and\n\u2022 our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined by our board of directors at the time of issuance or fixed by resolution without further action by the stockholders. These terms may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion rights, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock, and, therefore, could reduce the value of our common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of our\nboard of directors to issue preferred stock could delay, discourage, prevent or make it more difficult or costly to acquire or effect a change in control, thereby preserving the current stockholders\u2019 control.\nIn addition, under the agreements governing the Senior Secured Debt Facilities, a change in control may lead the lenders and/or holders to exercise remedies such as acceleration of the obligations thereunder, termination of their commitments to fund additional advances and collection against the collateral securing such obligations.\nPursuant to a limited liability company agreement entered into by Cerberus and certain other entities and individuals who agreed to co-invest with Cerberus through Keane Investor (the \u201cKeane Investor LLC Agreement\u201d), such appointees shall be selected by Keane Investor\u2019s board of managers so long as Keane is a controlled company under the applicable rules of the NYSE. See \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions and Director Independence-Keane Investor Limited Liability Company Agreement.\u201d\nThe Stockholders\u2019 Agreement provides that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, from the date on which (a) Keane is no longer a controlled company under the applicable rules of the NYSE but prior to the 35% Trigger Date, Keane Investor has the right to designate a number of individuals who satisfy the Director Requirements (as defined herein) equal to one director fewer than 50% of our board of directors at any time and shall cause its directors appointed to our board of directors to vote in favor of maintaining an 11-person board of directors unless the management board of Keane Investor otherwise agrees by the affirmative vote of 80% of the management board of Keane Investor; (b) a Holder (as defined herein) has beneficial ownership of at least 20% but less than 35% of our outstanding common stock, the Holder will have the right to designate a number of individuals who satisfy the Director Requirements equal to the greater of three or 25% of the size of our board of directors at any time (rounded up to the next whole number); (c) a Holder has beneficial ownership of at least 15% but less than 20% of our outstanding common stock, the Holder will have the right to designate the greater of two or 15% of the size of our board of directors at any time (rounded up to the next whole number); and (d) a Holder has beneficial ownership of at least 10% but less than 15% of our outstanding common stock, it will have the right to designate one individual who satisfies the Director Requirements. The ability of Keane Investor or a Holder to appoint one or more directors could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, even if beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (b) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders; (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds more favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nIf a substantial number of shares becomes available for sale and are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could decline and our stockholders may be diluted.\nIf our Existing Owners sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease. The perception in the public market that our Existing Owners might sell shares of common stock could also create a perceived overhang and depress our market price. We have 103,128,019 shares of common stock outstanding of which 72,239,439 shares are held by our Existing Owners through our current\nprincipal stockholder, Keane Investor. Prior to the IPO, we and our Existing Owners agreed with the underwriters to a \u201clock-up\u201d period, meaning that such parties may not, subject to certain exceptions, sell any of their existing shares of our common stock without the prior written consent of representatives of the underwriters for at least 180 days after January 19, 2017. Pursuant to the lock-up agreement, among other exceptions, we may enter into an agreement providing for the issuance of our common stock in connection with the acquisition, merger or joint venture with another publicly traded entity during the 180-day restricted period after January 19, 2017. In addition, all of our Existing Owners will be subject to the holding period requirement of Rule 144 under the Securities Act (\u201cRule 144\u201d). When the lock-up agreements expire, these shares will become eligible for sale, in some cases subject to the requirements of Rule 144.\nIn addition, our Existing Owners, through Keane Investor, will have substantial demand and incidental registration rights, as described in \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions and Director Independence-Stockholders\u2019 Agreement.\u201d The market price for shares of our common stock may drop when the restrictions on resale by our Existing Owners lapse.\nAny sale of additional common stock by our Existing Owners in the public market may result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, our stockholders may not receive any return on investment unless they sell their common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and our stockholders will not be guaranteed, or have contractual or other rights, to receive dividends. Our board of directors may, in its discretion, modify or repeal our dividend policy. The declaration and payment of dividends depends on various factors, including: our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nIn addition, we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends is restricted by agreements governing their debt instruments, and may be restricted by agreements governing any of our subsidiaries\u2019 future indebtedness. Furthermore, our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of their debt agreements to incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nUnder the DGCL, our board of directors may not authorize payment of a dividend unless it is either paid out of our surplus, as calculated in accordance with the DGCL, or if we do not have a surplus, it is paid out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.\nOur stockholders may be diluted by the future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our equity incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise.\nWe have 396,871,981 shares of common stock authorized but unissued under our certificate of incorporation. We will be authorized to issue these shares of common stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to common stock for consideration and on terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. We have reserved 7,734,601 shares of our common stock for awards that may be issued under our Equity and Incentive Award Plan. Any common stock that we issue, including under our Equity and Incentive Award Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, may result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities, including shares of our common stock, in connection with investments or acquisitions. We regularly evaluate potential acquisition opportunities, including ones that would be significant to us, and we are currently participating in processes regarding several potential acquisition opportunities, including ones that would be significant to us. We cannot predict the timing of any contemplated transactions, and none are currently probable, but any pending transaction could be entered into as soon as shortly after the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The number of shares of our common stock issued in\nconnection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 16557, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "NEX"}
