You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our business faces significant risks and uncertainties, and those described below may not be the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of these risks or uncertainties occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMETELSTAT\nOur future success depends solely on imetelstat, our only product candidate, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to develop imetelstat or advance imetelstat to subsequent clinical trials, or that we will be able to receive regulatory approval for imetelstat on a timely basis, or at all.\nImetelstat is our sole product candidate, upon whose success we are wholly dependent. We do not have any other products or product candidates. Our ability to develop imetelstat to and through regulatory approval and potential commercial launch is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully recruit, enroll and retain patients in, and complete the Phase 3 portion of IMerge;\n\u2022\nobtain agreement from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to any of our Phase 3 trial design proposals in MF, to support a potential regulatory approval path in MF, if any;\n\u2022\nproceed with further development of imetelstat in Phase 3 for MF, even if we obtain the agreement of the FDA on a Phase 3 trial design and/or feasible regulatory approval pathway in MF;\n\u2022\nobtain substantial additional capital in order to enable us to conduct our operations and to advance imetelstat to and through current and potential future clinical trials, including completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge and commencing, conducting and completing potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF and potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies, as well as regulatory approval and potential commercial launch;\n\u2022\ndevelop clinical plans for, and successfully commence, enroll and complete, potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, such as potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF and potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies;\n\u2022\ncause the INDs for imetelstat to be maintained without such INDs being placed on full or partial clinical hold by the FDA;\n\u2022\ngenerate sufficient safety and efficacy data from current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat that provide a positive benefit-risk profile and support the continued and future development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies;\n\u2022\nascertain that the use of imetelstat does not result in significant systemic or organ toxicities, including hepatotoxicity, or other safety issues resulting in an unacceptable benefit-risk profile;\n\u2022\ncollaborate successfully with clinical trial sites, academic institutions, clinical research organizations, or CROs, contractors, physician investigators and other third parties;\n\u2022\nobtain and maintain required regulatory clearances and approvals for imetelstat; for example, it is uncertain:\n\u25aa\nwhether the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries will require us to obtain and submit additional non-clinical, manufacturing, or clinical data to proceed with any potential future clinical trials,\n\u25aa\nhow the FDA and other regulatory authorities will interpret safety and efficacy data from any clinical trial, including from IMbark or IMerge,\n\u25aa\nwhat scope and type of clinical development and other data will be required before the FDA and other regulatory authorities might grant us marketing approval, if any, and\n\u25aa\nwhat the length of time and cost for us will be to complete any such requirements;\n\u2022\nenter into and maintain arrangements with third parties to provide services needed to further research and develop imetelstat, including maintaining the agreement with our CROs, or to manufacture imetelstat, in each case at commercially reasonable costs;\n\u2022\nenter into and maintain arrangements with third parties, or establish internal capabilities, to provide sales, marketing, distribution and other commercialization functions in compliance with applicable laws;\n\u2022\nobtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for the cost of imetelstat from governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors;\n\u2022\nobtain, maintain and enforce adequate intellectual property protection for imetelstat; and\n\u2022\nrecruit and retain personnel to support the development and potential commercialization of imetelstat, including completion of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge and potential clinical development of imetelstat in other indications and commercial resources to launch imetelstat.\nIf we are not able to successfully achieve the above-stated goals and overcome other challenges that we may encounter in the research, development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of imetelstat, we may be forced to abandon our development of imetelstat, which would severely harm our business and prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nCompletion of current clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, and commencement of potential future clinical trials of imetelstat could be interrupted, further delayed or abandoned for a variety of reasons.\nCurrently, the ongoing clinical trials of imetelstat are the Phase 2 and Phase 3 portions of IMerge. Completion of these clinical trials, and the commencement of any potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, such as potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF or potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies, could be interrupted, delayed or abandoned for a variety of reasons, including as a result of failures or delays in:\n\u2022\ndemonstrating sufficient safety and efficacy of imetelstat in current and potential future clinical trials, without safety issues, side effects or dose-limiting toxicities, including any additional or more severe safety issues in addition to those that have been observed to date in previous or ongoing clinical trials related to imetelstat, whether or not in the same indications or therapeutic areas;\n\u2022\nobtaining and/or maintaining regulatory clearances in the United States or other countries to conduct clinical trials, such as obtaining or maintaining regulatory clearances to commence, conduct or modify current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, in a timely manner, or at all, which could, for\nexample, prevent us from, or result in substantial delays in, conducting or completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, and even if such regulatory clearances are obtained, we may be unable to commence, conduct or complete current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, or may discontinue such trials, whether due to our inability to raise substantial additional capital or otherwise;\n\u2022\nmaintaining the INDs for imetelstat without such INDs being placed on full or partial clinical hold, suspended or subject to other requirements by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nproperly (i) completing the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, including assessing the durability of RBC-TI responses; and (ii) recruiting, enrolling, conducting and completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, and promptly or adequately reporting data from such trials;\n\u2022\nobtaining funding on commercially reasonable terms necessary to advance the development of imetelstat, including completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, and commencing, conducting and completing potential future clinical trials of imetelstat in other indications, such as potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF or potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies;\n\u2022\ndetermining a feasible registration path, if any, for late-stage development of imetelstat in MF, after submitting to the FDA Phase 3 trial design proposals in MF and conducting further discussions with the FDA regarding a potential regulatory approval path, if any;\n\u2022\nobtaining or accessing necessary clinical data in accordance with appropriate clinical or quality practices to ensure complete data sets;\n\u2022\nresponding to safety findings by the data review committees of current clinical trials, and safety or futility findings by the data review committees of potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, based on emerging data occurring during such clinical trials, such as significant systemic or organ toxicities, including severe cytopenias, hepatotoxicity, fatal bleeding with or without any associated thrombocytopenia, patient injury or death, or other safety issues, resulting in an unacceptable benefit-risk profile;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of imetelstat, or other clinical trial materials, in a manner that meets the quality standards of the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and responding to any disruptions to drug supply, clinical trial materials or quality issues that may arise;\n\u2022\nensuring the ability to manufacture and supply imetelstat at acceptable costs for potential Phase 3 clinical trials and commercialization;\n\u2022\nobtaining sufficient quantities of any study-related treatments, materials (including comparator products, placebo or combination therapies) or ancillary supplies;\n\u2022\nobtaining acceptance by regulatory authorities of any manufacturing changes for imetelstat, as well as successfully implementing any such manufacturing changes;\n\u2022\ncomplying with current and future regulatory requirements, policies or guidelines, including domestic and international laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, transparency, and the privacy and security of health information;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms and on a timely basis, if at all, with collaborators and vendors located in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, including our CROs, laboratory service providers and clinical trial sites, on all aspects of clinical development;\n\u2022\nobtaining timely review and clearances by regulatory authorities for any clinical protocol amendments or modifications to our manufacturing process which may be sought for current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, including responding to questions or comments from these authorities in a timely and adequate manner, which could, for example, prevent us from conducting or completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF, or potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies; and\n\u2022\nobtaining institutional review board or ethics committee approvals for clinical trial protocols or protocol amendments, including any future refinements to the trial design we may seek for the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, which could, for example, prevent us from conducting or completing the Phase 3 portion of\nIMerge, potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF, or potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies.\nFailures or delays with respect to any of these events could adversely affect our ability to conduct or complete any current clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, or commence, conduct and complete potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, such as potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF or potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies, which could increase development costs, or interrupt, further delay or halt our development or potential commercialization of imetelstat, any of which could severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling or retaining patients in clinical trials of imetelstat, including in the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, clinical development and commercialization activities could be further delayed or otherwise adversely affected, which would cause our business and business prospects to be severely harmed, and we might cease operations.\nThe timely completion of a clinical trial in accordance with its protocol depends, among other things, on the ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. For example, if we encounter challenges in screening, enrolling and retaining patients in the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, our completion of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge may be delayed or discontinued. If we experience difficulties in retaining patients in the treatment or follow-up phase of the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, our ability to continue to assess longer-term durability of RBC-TI responses would be adversely affected. The enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, depends on many factors, such as:\n\u2022\nour ability to identify and screen patients who meet the patient eligibility criteria specified in the protocol;\n\u2022\nthe size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoint;\n\u2022\nthe proximity of patients to trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe design of the trial, including potential patients\u2019 reluctance to participate in the trial due to the possibility of being assigned to a placebo control arm;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit and retain clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022\nclinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions of the potential advantages of imetelstat, both in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications being investigated, and as a result of data reported from previous or current clinical trials of imetelstat, and their willingness to participate in clinical trials of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that patients enrolled in any imetelstat clinical trial will drop out of the trial before completion due to lack of efficacy, adverse side effects, investigator decision, progressive disease, slow progress to later stage clinical trials, perceptions based on the decision by Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen, to terminate the Collaboration and License Agreement, or Collaboration Agreement, alternate treatments being approved for the indication, or personal issues.\nIn addition, current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, such as the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, will compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas with imetelstat and such trials may also be conducted at the same clinical sites. This competition will reduce the number and type of patients available to enroll or remain in current and potential future imetelstat clinical trials. Moreover, because imetelstat represents a departure from more commonly used methods for cancer treatment, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies, rather than enroll patients into imetelstat clinical trials, or may decide not to enroll, or may not recommend enrollment, in clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, based on efficacy and safety results reported to date and that may be reported in the future.\nDelays in patient enrollment or the inability to retain or treat patients could result in increased costs, lead to incomplete data sets, or adversely affect the timing or outcome of current and potential future clinical trials of\nimetelstat, such as the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect the clinical development and potential commercialization of imetelstat. Such occurrences would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nImetelstat may cause, or have attributed to it, undesirable or unintended side effects or other adverse events that could further delay or prevent the commencement and/or completion of clinical trials for imetelstat, further delay or prevent its regulatory approval, or limit its commercial potential.\nImetelstat may cause, or have attributed to it, undesirable or unintended side effects or other adverse events affecting its safety or efficacy that could interrupt, further delay or halt current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, such as the Phase 3 portion of IMerge. For example, adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities observed in previous and ongoing clinical trials of imetelstat include:\n\u2022\nhematologic toxicities, such as profound and/or prolonged thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, including one case of febrile neutropenia after prolonged myelosuppression with intracranial hemorrhage resulting in patient death, which the investigator assessed as possibly related to imetelstat;\n\u2022\nbleeding events, with or without thrombocytopenia;\n\u2022\nhepatotoxicity, such as liver function test, or LFT, abnormalities, the clinical significance and long-term consequences of which are currently undetermined, and hepatic failure;\n\u2022\ngastrointestinal events;\n\u2022\ninfections;\n\u2022\nmuscular and joint pain;\n\u2022\nfatigue;\n\u2022\nheadache, and\n\u2022\ninfusion-related reactions.\nIf patients in any clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 2 and Phase 3 portions of IMerge, potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF, or potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies, experience similar or more severe adverse events, or new or unusual adverse events, or if the FDA or other regulatory authorities determine that efficacy and safety data in current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat do not support an adequate benefit-risk profile to justify continued treatment of patients, then the FDA or other regulatory authorities may again place the INDs for imetelstat on clinical hold, as occurred in March 2014.\nFurther, clinical trials by their nature examine the effect of a potential therapy in a sample of the potential future patient population. As such, clinical trials conducted with imetelstat, to date and in the future, may not uncover all possible adverse events that patients treated with imetelstat may experience. Because remaining patients in the treatment phase of the Phase 2 portion of IMerge and patients in the Phase 3 portion of IMerge continue to receive imetelstat treatment, additional or more severe toxicities or safety issues, including additional serious adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities, may be observed as patient treatment continues and more data become available. In addition, since additional data are being generated from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 portions of IMerge, the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat will continue to be assessed, including the risk of hepatotoxicity, severe cytopenias, fatal bleeding with or without any associated thrombocytopenia, patient injury or death, and any other severe adverse effects that may be associated with life-threatening clinical outcomes. If such toxicities or other safety issues in any clinical trial of imetelstat are determined by us, the FDA or any other regulatory authority to result in an unacceptable benefit-risk profile, then:\n\u2022\nadditional information supporting the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat may be requested by the FDA or other regulatory authorities and if any such information supplied by us, or by Janssen, is not deemed acceptable, current clinical trials of imetelstat could be suspended, terminated, or placed on clinical hold by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe ability to retain enrolled patients in current clinical trials may be negatively affected, resulting in incomplete data sets and the inability to adequately assess the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat in a specific patient population; or\n\u2022\nadditional, unexpected clinical trials or non-clinical studies may be required to be conducted.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could interrupt, further delay, or halt, any development and potential commercialization of imetelstat by us, which would have a severe adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and the future of imetelstat, any of which might cause us to cease operations.\nResults and data we disclosed from prior non-clinical studies and clinical trials may not predict success in later clinical trials, and we cannot assure you that any ongoing or future clinical trials of imetelstat will lead to similar results and data that could potentially enable us to obtain any regulatory approvals.\nSuccess in non-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, nor does it predict final clinical trial results. We cannot be certain that any of the prior, current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat will generate sufficient, consistent or adequate efficacy and safety data demonstrating a positive benefit-risk profile, which would be necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market imetelstat in any indication. Imetelstat in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired benefit-risk profile despite having progressed through non-clinical studies and initial clinical trials. Many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have frequently suffered significant setbacks in later clinical trials, even after achieving promising results in earlier non-clinical studies or clinical trials.\nA trial design that is considered appropriate for regulatory approval includes a sufficiently large sample size with appropriate statistical power, as well as proper control of bias, to allow a meaningful interpretation of the results. The preliminary results of imetelstat clinical trials with smaller sample sizes can be disproportionately influenced by the impact the treatment had on a few individuals, which limits the ability to generalize the results across a broader community, making the trial results less reliable than trials with a larger number of patients. As a result, there may be less certainty that imetelstat would achieve a statistically significant effect in any future clinical trials. For example, in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, the initial data review for the 25-patient expansion cohort that was conducted by Janssen in the second quarter of 2018, which Janssen called a \u201cdata snapshot,\u201d exhibited 8-week RBC-TI rate of 28%, while the 13-patient initial cohort exhibited 8-week RBC-TI rate of 54% resulting in an overall 8-week RBC-TI rate of 37% for the combined cohorts. Patients in both the initial and expansion cohorts were na\u00efve to both HMA and lenalidomide and were non-del(5q). We believe the observed difference in 8-week RBC-TI rate between the 13-patient initial cohort and the 25-patient expansion cohort may be attributable to factors such as the maturity of the data at the time of the data snapshot since the median follow-up time of the expansion cohort at the time of the data snapshot was less than half the length of time the 13-patient initial cohort had been followed when their data were first reported, or the higher overall baseline transfusion burden of the expansion cohort. Although the latest reported 8-week RBC-TI rate in June 2019 is higher than that reported in the data snapshot from the second quarter of 2018, we cannot assure you that the 8-week RBC-TI rate reported for the combined cohorts in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge will improve further with longer follow-up, or at all, or that the 8-week RBC-TI rate of patients enrolled in the Phase 3 portion of IMerge will be comparable to what has been reported in the 13-patient initial cohort, the 25-patient expansion cohort, or the combined cohorts in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge. In general, Phase 3 clinical trials with larger numbers of patients or longer durations of therapy may fail to replicate efficacy results observed in earlier clinical trials, or may reveal safety concerns that were not identified in smaller or shorter trials, any of which could adversely affect future development prospects of imetelstat.\nIn addition, non-clinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. In some instances, there can be significant variability between different clinical trials of imetelstat due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in trial protocols, differences in the size and type of patient populations, and changes in and adherence to the dosing regimens. For example, complete and partial remissions were observed in the pilot study of imetelstat conducted at Mayo Clinic, or the Pilot Study. However, similar activity was not observed in the MF patients enrolled in IMbark, as shown by the one partial remission observed in the IMbark primary analysis. We believe that differences in the IMbark study design when compared to the Pilot Study design, such as more restrictive patient enrollment criteria requiring either documented objective lack of response to a JAK inhibitor or evidence of progressive disease while on treatment with a JAK inhibitor, may have contributed to the data observed in\nIMbark differing significantly from data reported from the Pilot Study, but we cannot assure you that any future clinical trials of imetelstat in MF will yield results comparable to IMbark or the Pilot Study. In addition, the potential improvement in survival observed in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm in IMbark will need to be further assessed in a Phase 3 clinical trial comparing imetelstat to a control therapy, and similar results, including potential improvement in survival, if any, with respect to any patient population or patient population subgroup, may not be observed. Likewise, although the statistical analyses comparing IMbark data to closely matched real-world data, or RWD, reported at the EHA Annual Congress meeting in June 2019, suggest favorable overall survival for imetelstat-treated relapsed/refractory MF patients compared to best available therapy using closely matched patients\u2019 RWD, such comparative analyses between RWD and our clinical trial data have several limitations. For instance, the analyses create a balance between treatment groups with respect to commonly available covariates, but do not take into account the unmeasured and unknown covariates that may affect the outcomes of the analyses. Potential biases are introduced by factors which include, for example, the selection of the patients included in the analyses, misclassification in the matching process, the small sample size, and estimates that may not represent the outcomes for the true treated patient population. For these and other reasons, such comparative analyses and any conclusions from such analyses should be considered carefully and with caution, and should not be relied upon as demonstrative or otherwise predictive or indicative of any future clinical trial results of imetelstat in relapsed/refractory MF.\nFailure to achieve positive results in current or potential future imetelstat clinical trials would interrupt, further delay, or halt, any development and potential commercialization of imetelstat by us, which would have a severe adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and the future of imetelstat, any of which might cause us to cease operations.\nInterim, \u201csnapshot,\u201d \u201ctop-line,\u201d and preliminary data or statistical analyses from clinical trials that we announce or publish from time-to-time may change as more patient data become available, may not be similar to the final data, and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. Thus, such preliminary data should be considered carefully and with caution and not relied upon as indicative of future clinical results.\nFrom time-to-time, preliminary or interim safety and efficacy data from previous and current imetelstat clinical trials have been reported or announced by us, clinical investigators or our prior collaboration partner(s). For example, preliminary data from the Phase 2 portion of IMerge were reported at the ASH Annual Meetings in December 2017 and December 2018, and at the EHA Annual Congress meetings in June 2018 and June 2019. We expect similar reports or announcements of safety and efficacy data from us or clinical investigators as data matures in current imetelstat clinical trials and from potential future clinical trials. Preliminary or interim results may not be reproduced in any potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, and thus should be considered carefully and with caution, and not relied upon as indicative of future clinical results. Material adverse differences in final data, compared to preliminary or interim data, could severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nAdditional or updated safety and efficacy data from current or potential future imetelstat clinical trials may result in a benefit-risk profile that does not justify the continued development of imetelstat in a particular patient population, or at all. For example, because patients remaining in the treatment phase continue to receive imetelstat in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, efficacy and safety data continue to be generated from the trial and will continue to evolve until all patients have ceased treatment. More mature data that may be reported from the Phase 2 portion of IMerge and any data in the Phase 3 portion of IMerge in the future may materially differ from data previously reported in IMerge, including with respect to the data previously reported from the initial and expansion cohorts in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge. Thus, the reported data should be considered carefully and with caution, and not relied upon as indicative of future clinical results. Such additional data could result in a lower benefit-risk profile than initially expected, which could hinder the enrollment, completion and potential success of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, or could cause us to abandon further development of imetelstat entirely.\nThe research and development of imetelstat is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe science and technology of telomere biology, telomerase and our proprietary oligonucleotide chemistry are relatively new. There is no precedent for the successful commercialization of a therapeutic product candidate based on these technologies. Significant research and development activities will be necessary to further develop imetelstat, which is our sole product candidate, which may take years to accomplish, if at all.\nBecause of the significant scientific, regulatory and commercial challenges that must be overcome to successfully research, develop and commercialize imetelstat, the development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies, including MF and MDS, or any other indications, may be further delayed or abandoned, even after significant resources have been expended on it. Examples of such situations include:\n\u2022\nin September 2012, the discontinuation of our Phase 2 clinical trial of imetelstat in metastatic breast cancer;\n\u2022\nin April 2013, the discontinuation of our development of imetelstat in solid tumors with short telomeres;\n\u2022\nin the third quarter of 2016, closure of the 4.7 mg/kg dosing arm in IMbark to new patient enrollment and suspension of enrollment in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm in IMbark because an insufficient number of patients in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm met the protocol defined interim efficacy criteria at 12 weeks;\n\u2022\nin the third quarter of 2017, expansion of the Phase 2 portion of IMerge to enroll additional lower risk MDS patients in a target patient population; and\n\u2022\nin September 2018, Janssen\u2019s decision to terminate the Collaboration Agreement.\nFurther delay, suspension or abandonment of the development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies, including resulting from our inability to successfully conduct and complete the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, and to plan for, commence, conduct and complete potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, such as potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF and potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies, could have a material adverse effect on the future of imetelstat and our business prospects, and we might cease operations.\nWe have limited experience as a company in conducting large-scale, late-stage clinical trials, such as the Phase 3 portion of IMerge or potential future similar trials, and no prior experience as a company in those functional areas that would be required for the successful commercialization of our sole product candidate, imetelstat.\nAlthough we recently have hired individuals who have experience conducting Phase 3 clinical trials, as a company we have limited experience in conducting large-scale, late-stage clinical trials, such as the Phase 3 portion of IMerge. We cannot be certain that we will be able to enroll, conduct or complete the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, or any other future large-scale, late-stage clinical trial of imetelstat, in a timely fashion, or at all. Large-scale, late-stage clinical trials will require additional financial resources and certain internal development experience that we are developing, as well as increased reliance on third-party clinical investigators, CROs, service providers, vendors, suppliers and consultants. Relying on these third parties and establishing effective and collaborative relationships with them to conduct large-scale, late-stage clinical trials may cause further delays that are outside of our control. Any such further delays could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not have experience as a company with activities that would be required for the commercialization of imetelstat, should we receive future regulatory approval to do so. Developing an internal sales, marketing and distribution capability is an expensive and time-consuming process, and will require additional management expertise. We may not be able to negotiate and enter into third-party marketing and distribution agreements on terms that are economically attractive, or at all. Even if we do enter into such agreements, third-party marketers and distributors may not successfully market or distribute our sole product candidate, imetelstat.\nOur inability to successfully plan, commence, enroll, conduct and complete large-scale, late-stage clinical trials, such as the Phase 3 portion of IMerge or future similar trials, or to successfully establish commercialization capabilities for imetelstat if we receive future regulatory approval to do so, would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to continue the development of, obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize imetelstat.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials. Therefore, we rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs, service providers, vendors, suppliers and consultants, to conduct clinical trials of imetelstat. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat play a critical role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. However, these third parties are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control their performance, or the amount or timing of resources that they devote to imetelstat. For example, we have retained CROs to support our imetelstat clinical development activities, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, and any failure by our CROs to perform their contractual obligations, or disputes with our CROs about the quality of their performance or other matters, could prevent us from enrolling, conducting or completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, or could otherwise further delay or halt our imetelstat clinical development activities. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. Under certain circumstances, these third parties may terminate their agreements with us without cause and upon immediate written notice.\nAlthough we rely on third parties to conduct any imetelstat clinical trials, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, we remain responsible for ensuring that each clinical trial is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards, including regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that patients are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. Our ability to comply with these regulations and standards is contingent upon activities conducted by third parties, and if they fail to perform in accordance with contractual obligations and legal requirements, our development of imetelstat may be interrupted, further delayed or halted, which would have a severe adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects and the future of imetelstat, any of which might cause us to cease operations.\nIn addition, the execution of clinical trials and the subsequent compilation and analysis of the data produced, requires coordination among various parties. In order for these functions to be carried out effectively and efficiently, it is imperative that these parties communicate and coordinate with one another. If the quality or accuracy of the clinical data obtained, compiled or analyzed by third parties is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or GCPs, or for any other reason, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties, which would cause delay, and could be difficult, costly or impossible. If third parties conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, or may be unsuccessful or need to be repeated, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might cause us to cease operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO TRANSITION OF THE IMETELSTAT PROGRAM TO GERON\nPoor performance by Janssen of the imetelstat program prior to its transition to us, or lack of cooperation following its transition to us, could severely and adversely affect imetelstat\u2019s future value and our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nAlthough transition of the imetelstat program to us was completed by the end of September 2019, risks to our ability to develop imetelstat related to our past collaboration remain, including:\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise concerning the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial objectives, or our license to the proprietary rights, which may result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022\nwe may become aware of errors or deficiencies in the conduct of the imetelstat program prior to its transition to us, and/or in the transition of the imetelstat program to us, which could adversely impact our future development of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nJanssen may refuse to provide, or may be unable to provide, information requested by the FDA or other regulatory authorities regarding the time period when Janssen was responsible for the imetelstat program;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with applicable regulatory guidelines prior to our assumption of sponsorship of the imetelstat program could result in administrative or judicially imposed sanctions on us, including warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, product seizures or detention, product recalls, total or partial suspension of manufacturing activities, and the potential refusal to approve any new drug applications;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain the INDs for imetelstat and to submit required regulatory reports within required timelines may be compromised if all data and information from the imetelstat program, including IMbark and IMerge, was not fully transferred to us; and\n\u2022\nJanssen may not properly maintain or defend intellectual property rights that we have licensed, may use our proprietary information in such a way as to cause disputes that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation, or may disclose our proprietary information in a manner that could put our intellectual property rights at risk.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could severely and adversely affect imetelstat\u2019s future value and our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY COMPLIANCE MATTERS\nAND COMMERCIALIZATION OF IMETELSTAT\nOur inability to maintain regulatory clearances and approvals to continue the clinical development of, and to potentially commercialize, imetelstat, would severely and adversely affect imetelstat\u2019s future value and our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nFederal, state and local governments in the United States and governments in other countries have significant regulations in place that govern drug research and development and may prevent us from successfully conducting development efforts or potentially commercializing imetelstat. Delays in obtaining or failure to maintain regulatory clearances and approvals or limitations in the scope of such clearances or approvals could:\n\u2022\nimpede or halt our activities and plans for clinical development and commercialization;\n\u2022\nsignificantly harm the commercial potential of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nimpose additional development costs;\n\u2022\ndiminish any competitive advantages that may have been available to us; or\n\u2022\nfurther delay or preclude any revenue we may receive from the future commercialization of imetelstat, if any.\nBefore we can seek to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of imetelstat, multiple clinical trials, including larger-scale Phase 3 clinical trials, will need to be conducted to demonstrate if imetelstat is safe and effective for use in a diverse population. We expect significant additional research, manufacturing activities and clinical testing to be required before we can file any application with the FDA or other regulatory authorities for regulatory approval of imetelstat. As such, we do not expect imetelstat to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Our clinical development program for imetelstat may not lead to regulatory approval from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities if we fail to demonstrate that imetelstat is safe and effective. If imetelstat cannot be successfully developed in clinical trials, including in the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, our business and business prospects would be severely and adversely affected, and we might cease operations. Even if we do successfully complete one or more clinical trials of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, those results are not necessarily predictive of results of future pivotal trials that may be needed before we may submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA for the initial or other future indications. We may therefore fail to further develop or commercialize imetelstat, which would severely and adversely affect our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nObtaining potential future regulatory clearances to market imetelstat in the United States and other countries is a costly and lengthy process, and we cannot predict when or if regulatory authorities will approve imetelstat for commercial sale.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. It may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive non-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may determine that imetelstat is not safe and effective, only moderately effective or has undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit imetelstat\u2019s commercial use. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render imetelstat not commercially viable. We do not expect imetelstat to be approved for commercial sale for many years, if at all.\nIn addition, changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment or promulgation of additional statutes, regulations or guidance, or changes in regulatory review for a submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional non-clinical, clinical or other studies. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries will assess the overall benefit-risk profile of imetelstat, and may conclude that the overall benefit-risk profile of imetelstat does not merit approval of imetelstat for marketing or further development for any indication. Varying interpretations of the data obtained from non-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of imetelstat which would harm imetelstat\u2019s future value and our business and business prospects.\nImetelstat must receive all relevant regulatory approvals before it may be marketed in the United States or other countries. Obtaining regulatory approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. For example, following the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom will be subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, during which EU rules will continue to apply. Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union are expected to continue in relation to the customs and trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union after December 31, 2020. Although the impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will not be known for some time, this could lead to a period of considerable uncertainty in relation to the regulatory process in Europe, which could result in a delay in the review of regulatory submissions made in Europe by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including potentially by us in the future, and could also lead to less efficient, more expensive, and potentially lengthier regulatory review processes for companies like us, who may seek to obtain regulatory approval for drug products in the European Union or the United Kingdom. Such regulatory changes in the United Kingdom or elsewhere could adversely affect and/or delay our ability to obtain approval of, and market and sell, imetelstat in the United States or other countries.\nRegulatory agencies may also not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of a drug, such as imetelstat. For example, future regulatory clearances, if any, that we might obtain for imetelstat may be limited to fewer or narrower indications than we might request, or may be granted subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. Future regulatory clearances, if any, may be limited to a smaller patient population, or may require a different drug formulation or a different manufacturing process, than we might in the future decide to seek.\nAny delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals of imetelstat, or limitations on any regulatory approval that we might receive in the future, if any, could reduce the potential commercial use of imetelstat, and potential market demand for imetelstat and therefore result in decreased revenue for us from any commercialization of imetelstat, any of which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, the price of our common stock, our business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nAlthough orphan drug designation has been granted to imetelstat for the treatment of MF and MDS, these designations may not be maintained, which would eliminate the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including the potential for market exclusivity, which would likely result in decreased sales revenue from commercialization of imetelstat, if any, and would likely harm our business and business prospects.\nThe FDA granted orphan drug designation to imetelstat in June 2015 for the treatment of MF and for the treatment of MDS in December 2015, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, granted it in December 2015 for the treatment of MF. The designation of imetelstat as an orphan drug does not guarantee that any regulatory authority will accelerate regulatory review of, or ultimately approve, imetelstat, nor does it limit the ability of any regulatory authority to grant orphan drug designation to product candidates of other companies that treat the same indications as imetelstat prior to imetelstat receiving any exclusive marketing approval.\nWe may lose orphan drug exclusivity if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for orphan drug designation was materially defective or if we cannot ensure sufficient quantities of imetelstat to meet the needs of patients with MF or MDS.\nEven if we maintain orphan drug exclusivity for imetelstat, the exclusivity may not effectively protect imetelstat from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug product is approved, the FDA or EMA can subsequently approve a different drug with the same active moiety for the same condition, if the FDA or EMA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. The occurrence of any of these events could result in decreased sales of imetelstat, should it ever receive marketing approval, and may harm our business and business prospects. In addition, orphan drug designation will neither shorten the development time nor regulatory review time for imetelstat, and does not give imetelstat any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nA Fast Track designation by the FDA, such as the Fast Track designations received for imetelstat for MDS and relapsed/refractory MF, does not guarantee approval and may not lead to a faster development, regulatory review or approval process.\nIn October 2017, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the imetelstat clinical development program for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low or Intermediate-1 risk MDS who are non-del(5q) and who are refractory or resistant to treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent. In September 2019, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the development of imetelstat for adult patients with Intermediate-2 or High-risk MF whose disease has relapsed after or is refractory to JAK inhibitor treatment.\nFast Track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA review staff, as well as eligibility for priority review, if relevant criteria are met, and rolling review. Fast Track designation is intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of an NDA to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. However, Fast Track designation does not accelerate conduct of clinical trials or mean that the regulatory requirements are less stringent, nor does it ensure that imetelstat will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. In addition, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation for any indication if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging from the imetelstat clinical development program.\nFailure to achieve continued compliance with government regulations could delay or halt potential commercialization of imetelstat.\nApproved products and their manufacturers are subject to continual review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or its manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer, including import restrictions, seizure and withdrawal of the product from the market. If approved for commercial sale, future sales of imetelstat will be subject to government regulation related to numerous matters, including the processes of:\n\u2022\nmanufacturing;\n\u2022\nadvertising and promoting;\n\u2022\nselling and marketing;\n\u2022\nlabeling; and\n\u2022\ndistribution.\nIf, and to the extent that, we are unable to comply with these regulations, our ability to earn potential revenue from the commercialization of imetelstat, if any, would be materially and adversely impacted.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in severe civil and criminal penalties, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nrecall or seizure of products;\n\u2022\ninjunctions against the import, manufacture, distribution, sales and/or marketing of products; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nThe imposition of any of these penalties or other commercial limitations would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING\nOur failure to obtain additional capital would force us to further delay, reduce or eliminate development of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF, and potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies, and our potential future imetelstat commercialization efforts, any of which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nSuccessful drug development and commercialization requires significant amounts of capital. In this regard, we believe that our existing capital resources and future interest income is sufficient to continue the IMerge Phase 2/3 clinical trial through 2020 and to commence a proof-of-concept study in additional hematologic myeloid malignancies in 2020. Accordingly, we will require substantial additional capital in order to further advance the imetelstat program, including conducting the research and development, clinical, regulatory and potential commercialization activities necessary to bring imetelstat to market. In this regard, our ability to complete the Phase 3 portion of IMerge and to commence, conduct and complete potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, such as potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF or potential additional proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies, is dependent on our ability to raise substantial additional capital. In addition, our ability to commercialize imetelstat in the United States, if regulatory approval is granted, depends on us being able to establish sales and marketing capabilities. Because the outcome of any clinical activities and/or regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate whether any development activities we may undertake will succeed, and we may never recoup our investment in any imetelstat development, which would adversely affect our financial condition and our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations. Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for our capital needs;\n\u2022\nthe progress, timing, magnitude, scope and costs of clinical development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of imetelstat, including the number of indications being pursued, subject to clearances and approvals by the FDA and other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, duration, results and costs of current and potential future clinical trials, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF and potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies, as well as non-clinical studies and assessments, of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews or other regulatory actions related to imetelstat, such as submitting Phase 3 trial design proposals in MF and conducting further discussions with the FDA\nregarding a potential regulatory approval path in MF, as well as obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals in the United States and in other countries;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022\nthe costs of manufacturing imetelstat, including our ability to achieve any meaningful reduction in manufacturing costs;\n\u2022\nthe costs of multiple third-party vendors and service providers, including our CROs and CMOs, to pursue the development, manufacturing and potential commercialization of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish, enforce and maintain collaborative or other strategic arrangements for research, development, clinical testing and manufacturing of imetelstat and potential future commercialization and marketing;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully market and sell imetelstat, if imetelstat receives future regulatory approval or clearance, in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\nour need to successfully recruit and retain additional key personnel to support the development and potential future commercialization of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing necessary to build a U.S. sales force to market and sell imetelstat, should it receive regulatory clearance;\n\u2022\nthe sales price for imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement for imetelstat;\n\u2022\nexpenses associated with the pending putative securities class action lawsuits and potential additional related lawsuits, as well as any other litigation;\n\u2022\nthe extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with pending and potential future litigation; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of maintaining and operating facilities in California and New Jersey, including higher expenses for travel, telecommunications and administrative oversight.\nAs a result of the termination of the Collaboration Agreement effective September 28, 2018, we are responsible for funding all clinical development, manufacturing, intellectual property maintenance and potential commercial activities for the imetelstat program. In order to further advance the imetelstat program, including completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge and commencing, conducting and completing potential future clinical trials in other indications, such as potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF or potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies, we will need to raise substantial additional capital or establish additional collaborative arrangements with third-party collaborative partners, which may not be possible. In addition, as a result of the termination of the Collaboration Agreement, we will not receive any milestone payments or royalties from Janssen for the development or sale of imetelstat, including any clinical development milestones. If we are unable to raise additional capital or establish alternative collaborative arrangements with third-party collaborative partners for imetelstat, the development of imetelstat may be further delayed, altered or abandoned, which might cause us to cease operations. Additional financing through public or private equity financings, including pursuant to our 2018 Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR, capital lease transactions or other financing sources may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We may raise equity capital at a stock price or on other terms that could result in substantial dilution of ownership for our stockholders. The receptivity of the public and private equity markets to proposed financings is substantially affected by the general economic, market and political climate and by other factors which are unpredictable and over which we have no control. In this regard, volatility and instability in the global financial markets and political climate could adversely affect our ability to raise additional funds through financings and the terms upon which we may raise those funds.\nIn addition, we may seek additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders may be diluted,\nand the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that materially and adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through alliance, collaborative or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to imetelstat or our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe cannot assure you that our existing capital resources, future interest income, and potential future sales of our common stock, including under our 2018 Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR, will be sufficient to fund our operating plans. In any event, we will need substantial additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements to advance the imetelstat program in clinical development and potential commercialization, and our need for additional funds may arise sooner than planned. If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, if at all, we may be unable to pursue further development, including completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, and commencing, conducting and completing potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF, or potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies, or to pursue potential commercialization of imetelstat, which would severely harm our business and we might cease operations.\nWe currently have no source of product revenue and may never become consistently profitable.\nAlthough we were profitable in 2015 due to the recognition of revenue in connection with the upfront payment from Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement, we have otherwise never been profitable and have incurred operating losses every year since our operations began in 1990. We will not receive any future milestone-based or royalty payments from Janssen relating to imetelstat, nor will Janssen share the cost of ongoing or future clinical trials of imetelstat or the costs for patents that were licensed to them under the terminated Collaboration Agreement, after September 28, 2018. We expect to continue to incur significant additional operating losses and our operating losses are likely to substantially increase given our sole financial responsibility for imetelstat clinical development activities. As of December 31, 2019, our accumulated deficit was approximately $1.1 billion. Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nSubstantially all of our revenues to date have been payments under collaboration agreements and milestones, royalties and other revenues from our licensing arrangements. With the termination of the Collaboration Agreement effective September 28, 2018, we have no ongoing collaboration agreements related to imetelstat. The patents underlying our license agreements related to our human telomerase reverse transcriptase, or hTERT, technology have expired. Any final revenues generated from our remaining licensing agreements related to our hTERT technology are expected to be minimal, and will be insufficient to sustain our operations. We have no current plans to enter into any new corporate collaboration, partnership or license agreements that result in revenues.\nWe also expect to experience increased negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operations and imetelstat clinical development activities advance. This will result in decreases in our working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Further, we may be unable to replenish our working capital by future financings. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve consistent future profitability. We may never achieve consistent future profitability. Even if we do become profitable in the future, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to achieve consistent future profitability could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and our ability to sustain operations.\nThe 2017 comprehensive tax reform bill and possible future changes in tax laws or regulations could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law tax legislation, which we refer to as the Tax Act, which significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Future guidance from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our U.S. operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Act or future tax reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges in the current or future taxable years, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense. The foregoing items, as well as any other future changes in tax laws, could have a material adverse effect\non our business, cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards attributable to tax years ending before 2018 could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under the Tax Act, federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the federal tax law changes. In addition, under Section 382 of the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. Changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, may have resulted or could in the future result in an ownership change. If a limitation were to apply, utilization of a portion of our domestic net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could be limited in future periods. In addition, a portion of the carryforwards may expire before being available to reduce future income tax liabilities which could adversely impact our financial position.\nRISKS RELATED TO MANUFACTURING IMETELSTAT\nFailure by us to establish and/or maintain a manufacturing supply chain to appropriately and adequately supply imetelstat for future clinical and commercial uses, would result in a further delay in or cessation of clinical trials and a further delay in or our inability to obtain regulatory approvals of imetelstat, and our business and business prospects could be severely harmed, and we could cease operations.\nAlthough we have received inventories of drug product, drug substance and raw materials from Janssen under the Supply Agreement that meet our specifications, some of this material will require further processing in order to be used in clinical trials, and/or may also require regulatory review and acceptance prior to use. Therefore, we continue to work to re-establish our own manufacturing supply chain in order to further process the Janssen purchased materials as well as to be able to manufacture and supply additional quantities of imetelstat that meet applicable regulatory standards for current and potential future clinical trials and potential commercial uses. The process of manufacturing imetelstat is complex and subject to several risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe ability to scale-up and attain sufficient production yields with appropriate quality control and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nreliance on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and suppliers;\n\u2022\nsupply chain issues, including the timely availability and shelf life requirements of raw materials and other supplies;\n\u2022\nshortage of qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\nregulatory acceptance and compliance with regulatory requirements, which are less well-defined for oligonucleotide products than for small molecule drugs and vary in each country where imetelstat might be sold or used.\nAs a result of these and other risks, we may be unable to establish and/or maintain a manufacturing supply chain capable of providing imetelstat for the Phase 3 portion of IMerge and/or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, and potential future commercial uses, which would delay or result in a cessation of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat. Occurrence of any such events would further delay or preclude any applications for regulatory approval and therefore further delay or preclude our ability to earn revenue from the commercialization, if any, of imetelstat, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nIf third parties that manufacture imetelstat fail to perform as needed, then the clinical and commercial supply of imetelstat will be limited, and we may be unable to conduct or complete current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat or to commercialize imetelstat in the future.\nOur planned imetelstat manufacturing supply chain is expected to rely solely upon third-party contractors to perform certain process development or other technical and scientific work with respect to imetelstat, as well as to supply starting materials and manufacture drug substance and drug product. While we are currently in the process of establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of imetelstat, our failure to establish such arrangements in a timely manner, or at all, could further delay, perhaps substantially, or preclude our ability to pursue imetelstat development on our own, increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our financial results, business and business prospects. We may not be able to obtain third-party manufacturers for imetelstat on acceptable terms, or at all. We expect to rely on third-party contractors to produce and deliver sufficient quantities of imetelstat and other materials to support clinical trials on a timely basis and to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. We will not have direct control over these third-party personnel or operations. Reliance on these third-party manufacturers is subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nbeing unable to identify suitable third-party manufacturers, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require significant activities to validate and qualify any replacement manufacturer, which could involve new testing and compliance inspections;\n\u2022\nbeing unable to execute timely contracts with third-party manufacturers on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe inability of third-party manufacturers to timely formulate and manufacture imetelstat or to produce imetelstat in the quantities or of the quality required to meet clinical and commercial needs;\n\u2022\ndecisions by third-party manufacturers to exit the contract manufacturing business during the time required to supply clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute products;\n\u2022\ncompliance by third-party manufacturers with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, standards mandated by the FDA and state agencies and other government regulations corresponding to foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nbreach or termination of manufacturing contracts;\n\u2022\ninadequate storage or maintenance at contracted facilities resulting in theft or spoilage;\n\u2022\ncapacity limitation and scheduling imetelstat manufacturing activities as a priority in contracted facilities; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters that affect contracted facilities.\nEach of these risks could lead to delays or shortages in drug supply, or the inability to manufacture drug supply necessary for non-clinical and clinical activities, and commercialization. For example, manufacturing delays could adversely impact the conduct or completion of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge or commencement of potential future clinical trials or preclude or delay potential future commercial sales, which could severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nIn addition, third-party contractors and/or any other contractors may need to make substantial investments to enable sufficient capacity increases and cost reductions, and to implement those regulatory and compliance standards necessary for successful Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial production of imetelstat. These third-party contractors may not be willing or able to achieve such capacity increases, cost reductions, or regulatory and compliance standards, and even if they do, such achievements may not be at commercially reasonable costs. Changing manufacturers may be prolonged and difficult due to inherent technical complexities and because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIt may not be possible to manufacture imetelstat at costs or scales necessary to conduct clinical trials or potential future commercialization activities.\nOligonucleotides are relatively large molecules produced using complex chemistry, and the cost of manufacturing an oligonucleotide like imetelstat is greater than the cost of making typical small molecule drugs. Therefore, imetelstat for clinical use is more expensive to manufacture than most other treatments currently available today or that may be available in the future. Similarly, the cost of manufacturing imetelstat for commercial use will need to be significantly lower than current costs in order for imetelstat to become a commercially successful product. We may not be able to achieve sufficient scale increases or cost reductions necessary for successful commercial production of imetelstat. Failure to achieve necessary cost reductions could result in decreased sales, if any, for us, which would materially and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO MANAGING OUR GROWTH AND OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS\nWe may be unable to successfully retain or recruit key personnel to support the development and potential future commercialization of imetelstat or to otherwise successfully manage our growth.\nOur ability to successfully develop imetelstat in the future and to potentially commercialize imetelstat depends to a significant extent on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive officers and key members of our staff. In addition, we will need to maintain and continue to hire experienced personnel in clinical science, biostatistics, clinical operations, pharmacovigilance, quality, manufacturing, regulatory affairs, medical affairs and sales and marketing, to enable us to further develop and potentially commercialize imetelstat.\nWe face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and other research institutions, and competition in our geographic regions is particularly intense. The substantial risks and uncertainties related to our development and potential commercialization of imetelstat, as well as the previous restructurings we implemented and the risks and uncertainties regarding our future business viability, could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel or we may incur unanticipated inefficiencies caused by our reduced personnel resources. We may also face higher than expected personnel costs in order to attract new management or development personnel, or to maintain our current executive officers and staff. If we are unable to successfully retain, motivate and incentivize our existing personnel, or to attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified management and senior development personnel in the future on acceptable terms, our ability to further develop imetelstat will be impaired, and our business and the price of our common stock would be adversely impacted.\nAs our operations continue to expand, we expect that we will need to manage new and additional relationships with various service providers, vendors, suppliers and other third parties, as well as additional and expanded office locations, for example, our recently leased office in northern New Jersey and the planned relocation of our corporate headquarters in California. Our ability to timely occupy and relocate to our new corporate headquarters in California depends on the performance by our lessor, as well as contractors and other third parties, of their contractual obligations. Such continued growth and expansion will require members of our management to assume significant added responsibilities. Our performance in managing any such future growth, if ineffective, could negatively impact our business prospects. We may not successfully manage our imetelstat development efforts effectively, including our current and potential future imetelstat clinical trials. If we fail to achieve key development goals, our abilities to grow as a company, and to further develop and potentially commercialize imetelstat, could be prevented or hindered, and our business and business prospects would be severely harmed, which might cause us to cease operations.\nWe expect imetelstat to remain our sole product candidate for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize imetelstat, our business and business prospects would be severely harmed, which might cause us to cease operations.\nWe plan to focus our efforts on the further development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies. Accordingly, we do not currently have any plans to engage in any efforts to discover new product candidates. In addition, the outcome of our future efforts to seek to acquire and/or in-license other oncology products, product candidates, programs or companies in order to diversify our product candidate portfolio are highly uncertain and may\nbe unsuccessful. As a result, we will be wholly reliant upon the development of imetelstat, our sole product candidate, for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize imetelstat, our business and business prospects would be severely harmed, which might cause us to cease operations.\nIf we are unable to establish potential future collaborative arrangements for imetelstat, we may have to delay, alter or abandon our imetelstat development and commercialization plans.\nWe intend to develop imetelstat broadly for hematologic myeloid malignancies, and to potentially commercialize, market and sell imetelstat in the United States. We plan to seek another collaborative partner or partners, at an appropriate time, to assist us in the potential development and commercialization of imetelstat outside the United States, and to provide funding for such activities. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborative partners, and these potential collaborative arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement. We may not be able to negotiate collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all. In this regard, collaborative arrangements with third parties may require us to relinquish material rights, including revenue from potential commercialization, on terms that are less attractive than under the Collaboration Agreement we had with Janssen, or to assume material ongoing development obligations that we would have to fund or otherwise support.\nIn any event, we are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any collaborative arrangements because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing collaborative arrangements. Moreover, as a result of the termination of the Collaboration Agreement and the significant risks and uncertainties regarding the future imetelstat development program, potential collaborative partners may be reluctant to enter into new collaborative arrangements with us, or may only be willing to do so on terms that are not favorable to us. As a result, we may not be successful in finding a new collaborative partner or partners on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to negotiate collaborative arrangements, we may have to:\n\u2022\ncurtail the development of imetelstat,\n\u2022\nfurther delay, alter or abandon the imetelstat development program,\n\u2022\nfurther delay or abandon its potential commercialization,\n\u2022\nreduce the scope of potential future sales or marketing activities, or\n\u2022\nincrease our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense, which will require substantial additional capital than our current resources.\nIn order to advance the imetelstat program, including completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge and commencing, conducting and completing potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, such as potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF and potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies, as well as undertaking potential commercialization activities for imetelstat in the United States, we will need to raise substantial additional capital. In addition, if we elect to increase our expenditures to fund imetelstat development or commercialization activities outside the United States, we will be required to substantially increase our personnel resources and we will need to obtain substantial further capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise substantial additional capital, we will not be able to advance the imetelstat program, including completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge and commencing, conducting and completing potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, such as potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF and potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies, nor will we be able to bring imetelstat to market and generate product revenues. Establishing the infrastructure necessary to further develop, commercialize, market and sell imetelstat worldwide will require substantial resources and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and negatively impact our imetelstat development or commercialization efforts in the United States.\nWe currently have no products approved for commercial sale and we have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain marketing approvals for any product candidates, which makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe have never derived any revenue from the sales of any products. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring, developing and securing our technology, undertaking non-clinical studies and clinical trials of imetelstat and past product candidates that we have subsequently discontinued, and\nengaging in research and development under collaboration agreements. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approvals for commercialization activities, formulate and manufacture commercial-scale products, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, for these and other reasons discussed elsewhere in these risk factors, it is difficult to predict our future success and the viability of our business and the imetelstat program.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities in order to protect ourselves against product liability claims or claims related to clinical trial conduct.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic and diagnostic products. We may become subject to product liability claims or claims related to clinical trial conduct if the use of imetelstat is alleged to have injured patients, including any injuries alleged to arise from any hepatotoxicity or hemorrhagic event associated with the use of imetelstat. We currently have limited clinical trial liability insurance, and we may not be able to maintain this type of insurance for any clinical trials, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, or this type of insurance may become too expensive for us to afford because of the highly risky and uncertain nature of clinical trials generally and the high cost of insurance for our business activities. In addition, business liability and product liability insurance are becoming increasingly expensive, particularly for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and the pool of insurers offering insurance coverage to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is becoming smaller, making it more difficult to obtain insurance for our business activities at a reasonable price, or at all. Being unable to obtain or maintain product liability, clinical trial liability, or other insurance for our business activities in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities would have a material adverse effect on our business, and could cause us to cease our development of imetelstat.\nWe and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in putative securities class action lawsuits. These lawsuits, and potential similar or related lawsuits, could result in substantial damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. These lawsuits, and any other lawsuits to which we are subject, will be costly to defend or pursue and are uncertain in their outcome.\nSecurities-related class action lawsuits and/or derivative lawsuits have often been brought against companies, including biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies, that experience volatility in the market price of their securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because we often experience significant stock price volatility in connection with our product development activities. On January 23 and February 14, 2020, putative securities class action lawsuits were commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, naming as defendants us and one of our officers. On March 5, 2020, a third putative securities class action lawsuit was commenced in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, naming as defendants us and two of our officers. All three lawsuits allege violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with allegedly false and misleading statements made by us related to IMbark during the period from March 19, 2018 to September 26, 2018. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that we failed to disclose facts related to the alleged failure by IMbark to meet the two primary endpoints of the trial, spleen response rate and Total Symptom Score, and that our stock price dropped when such information was disclosed. The plaintiffs seek damages and interest, and an award of reasonable costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees.\nIt is possible that additional lawsuits will be filed, or allegations received from stockholders, with respect to these same or other matters and also naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants. Such lawsuits and any other related lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual defense and disposition costs will depend upon many unknown factors. The outcome of such lawsuits is necessarily uncertain. We could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of the pending lawsuits and any additional lawsuits, and we may not prevail. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with such lawsuits. We currently are not able to estimate the possible cost to us from these matters, as the pending lawsuits are currently at an early stage, and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve the pending lawsuits or the possible amount of any damages that we may be required to pay. Monitoring, initiating and defending against legal actions is time-consuming for our management, is likely to be expensive and may detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. We could be forced to expend significant resources in the settlement or defense of the pending\nlawsuits and any potential future lawsuits, and we may not prevail in such lawsuits. Additionally, we may not be successful in having any such lawsuits dismissed or settled within the limits of our insurance coverage.\nWe have not established any reserve for any potential liability relating to the pending lawsuits or any potential future lawsuits. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. A decision adverse to our interests in the pending lawsuits, or in similar or related litigation, could result in the payment of substantial damages, or possibly fines, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, our stock price, cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to third-party litigation, and such litigation would be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome.\nOur business may bring us into conflict with our licensees, licensors, or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships, or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours. We may experience employment-related disputes as we seek to expand our personnel resources. We may face litigation with Janssen arising from or related to the Collaboration Agreement and/or its termination. We may become involved in performance or other disputes with the CROs we have retained to support our imetelstat clinical development activities, or with other third parties such as service providers, vendors, manufacturers, suppliers or consultants, which could result in a further delay or cessation of current and potential future clinical trials and otherwise significantly further delay our ability to develop imetelstat. If we are unable to resolve those conflicts on terms that are satisfactory to all parties, we may become involved in litigation brought by or against us.\nLawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and defense and disposition costs depend upon many unknown factors. Despite the availability of insurance, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with litigation. Lawsuits could result in judgments against us that require us to pay damages, enjoin us from certain activities, or otherwise negatively affect our legal or contractual rights, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In addition, the inherent uncertainty of such litigation could lead to increased volatility in our stock price and a decrease in the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment in our common stock.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the recent coronavirus, or COVID-19, outbreak, in regions where we or third parties on which we rely have significant manufacturing facilities, concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations. We have a significant number of clinical trial sites in countries that have been directly affected by COVID-19, and depend on countries affected by COVID-19 for manufacturing operations for various stages of our supply chain. In addition, if COVID-19 becomes a worldwide pandemic, it could materially affect our operations globally, including at our headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area and at our clinical trial sites throughout the globe.\nOur business could be adversely affected by health epidemics in regions where we have significant manufacturing facilities, concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations.\nIf the COVID-19 outbreak continues to spread, we may need to limit operations or implement limitations, including limiting business travel and mandating work from home practices. There is a risk that other countries or regions may be less effective at containing COVID-19, or it may be more difficult to contain if the outbreak reaches a larger population or broader geography, in which case the risks described herein could be elevated significantly.\nIn particular, some of our suppliers of certain materials used in the production of imetelstat are located in countries affected by COVID-19. In these countries, closures and other restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak in the region may disrupt our supply chain or limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for the manufacture of imetelstat.\nIn addition, our clinical trials may be affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Site initiation, patient enrollment and patient monitoring may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 outbreak. If COVID-19 becomes a worldwide pandemic, it may delay enrollment and monitoring in the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, and some patients may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services, and we may be unable to obtain blood samples for testing.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our supply chain, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.\nBusiness interruptions by natural disasters and other events beyond our control could negatively impact our business.\nOur business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters and catastrophic events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, tsunamis, fires, droughts, tornadoes, public health issues and pandemics, severe changes in climate, war, terrorism, and geo-political unrest and uncertainties. Further, outbreaks of pandemic diseases, such as coronavirus, or the fear of such events, could provoke responses, including government-imposed travel restrictions. Any delays or interruptions caused by any such events could negatively affect our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur success and the success of our planned future development and commercialization of imetelstat will depend on our ability to protect our technologies and imetelstat through patents and other intellectual property rights.\nProtection of our proprietary technology is critically important to our business. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and extend our patents and maintain trade secrets, both in the United States and in other countries.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing imetelstat or our technology and/or limit the duration of the patent protection for imetelstat and our technology. In the event that we are unsuccessful in obtaining, maintaining, enforcing and extending our patents and other intellectual property rights or having our licensors maintain the intellectual property rights we have licensed, the value of imetelstat and/or our technologies will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to further develop or potentially commercialize imetelstat. Loss or impairment of our intellectual property related to imetelstat might further delay or halt ongoing or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat and any applications for regulatory approval, and therefore further delay or preclude any future development or commercialization of imetelstat by us. Further, if imetelstat is approved for commercial sale, such loss of intellectual property rights could impair our ability to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to imetelstat and therefore result in decreased sales for us. Occurrence of any of these events would materially and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent rights depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the Patent Office, and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents and/or patent applications will have to be paid to the Patent Office and various government patent agencies outside the United States over the lifetime of our owned and licensed patents and/or patent applications and any patent rights we may own or license in the future. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, nonpayment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market with imetelstat or similar products, and this circumstance could harm our business and business prospects and the future of imetelstat. In addition, if we are\nresponsible for patent prosecution and maintenance of patent rights in-licensed to us, any of the foregoing could expose us to liability to the applicable patent owner.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on imetelstat for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after its first effective filing date. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of imetelstat, patents protecting imetelstat might expire before imetelstat is commercialized. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to imetelstat.\nUnder the Hatch-Waxman Act, a patent may be eligible for future patent term restoration of up to five years under certain circumstances. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any potential marketing approval of imetelstat, one or more of our owned or licensed U.S. patents may be eligible for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Similar extensions are also available in certain foreign countries and territories, such as in Japan and in Europe. If we fail to apply for applicable patent term extensions or adjustments, we will have a more limited time during which we can enforce our granted patent rights. In addition, should we seek such a patent term extension, we may not be granted any such patent term extension and/or the applicable time period of such patent term extension could be less than five years. Moreover, in some countries the scope of protection for claims under such patent term extensions, if any, does not extend to the full scope of the claims but is limited to the product composition as approved. If we do not have sufficient patent life to protect imetelstat, our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat would be materially and adversely affected, which might cause us to cease operations.\nChanges in U.S. or foreign patent law or interpretations of such patent laws could diminish the value of our patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our technologies and imetelstat.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, including ours, are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and technical questions. In particular, legal principles for biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents in the United States and in other countries are evolving, and the extent to which we will be able to obtain patent coverage to protect our technologies and imetelstat, or enforce or defend issued patents, is uncertain.\nA number of significant changes to U.S. patent law occurred when the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the AIA, was signed into law on September 16, 2011. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are examined and may affect patent litigation. Many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the AIA, and in particular, the first to file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. For example, the AIA limits where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit. The AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nSince the publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by at least several months and sometimes several years, the persons or entities that we name as inventors in our patents and patent applications may not have been the first to invent the inventions disclosed in the patent applications or patents, or the first to file patent applications for these inventions. As a result, we may not be able to obtain patents for discoveries that we otherwise would consider patentable and that we consider to be extremely significant to the future success of imetelstat. Thus, our ability to protect our patentable intellectual property depends, in part, on our ability to be the first to file patent applications with respect to our inventions or inventions that were developed by Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement and to which we have an exclusive license for the future development, commercialization and manufacture of imetelstat. Delay in the filing of a patent application for any purpose, including further development or refinement of an invention, may result in the risk of loss of patent rights.\nU.S. court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. On March 20, 2012, in Mayo Collaborative Services, DBA Mayo Medical Laboratories, et al. v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Court held that several claims drawn to measuring drug metabolite levels from patient samples and correlating them to drug doses were not patentable subject matter. In addition, court rulings in cases such as BRCA1- & BRCA2-Based Hereditary Cancer Test Patent Litig. and Promega Corp. v. Life Technologies Corp. have also narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain certain patent claims in the future, this\ncombination of events may have created uncertainty with respect to the value of certain patents we have previously obtained or in-licensed.\nFollowing the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom will be subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, during which EU rules will continue to apply. Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union are expected to continue in relation to the customs and trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union after December 31, 2020. The impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will not be known for some time, which could lead to a period of considerable uncertainty relating to our ability to obtain and maintain Supplementary Protection Certificates of imetelstat based on our United Kingdom patents and our ability to establish and maintain European trademarks in the United Kingdom.\nIn 2012, the European Union Patent Package, or EU Patent Package, regulations were passed with the goal of providing for a single pan-European Unity Patent, or UP, and a new European Unified Patent Court, or UPC, for litigation of European patents. Once established, the UPC would have jurisdiction over traditional European patents and new UPs in the United Kingdom and all Contracting Member States of the European Union. However, political activity in the United Kingdom and a legal challenge in Germany has delayed ratification of the EU Patent Package in these countries. There have been many delays in the implementation of the EU Patent Package, and further delays may occur. When the EU Patent Package is ratified and in effect, all European patents, including those issued prior to ratification, would by default automatically fall under the jurisdiction of the UPC and allow for the possibility of obtaining pan-European injunctions. Under the EU Patent Package as currently proposed, once the UPC is established, patent holders are permitted to \u201copt out\u201d of the UPC on a patent-by-patent basis, although the time permitted for this opt-out is not yet known. Owners of traditional European patent applications who receive notice of grant after the EU Patent Package is ratified could validate the patent nationally, and file an opt-out demand. The EU Patent Package may increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement or defense of our issued European patents. The full impact on future European patent filing strategy and the enforcement or defense of our issued European patents in member states and/or the UPC is not known.\nDepending on decisions by the U.S. federal courts, the Patent Office and similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the interpretation of laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents. Occurrence of these events and/or significant impairment of our imetelstat patent rights would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, which might cause us to cease operations.\nChallenges to our owned or licensed patent rights would result in costly and time-consuming legal proceedings that could prevent or limit development of imetelstat.\nOur patents or those patent rights we have licensed, including patent rights that we may seek with respect to inventions made by past or future collaborators, may be challenged through administrative or judicial proceedings, which could result in the loss of important patent rights. For example, where more than one party seeks U.S. patent protection for the same technology in patent applications that are subject to the law before the implementation of the AIA, the Patent Office may declare an interference proceeding in order to ascertain the party to which the patent should be issued. Patent interferences are typically complex, highly contested legal proceedings, subject to appeal. They are usually expensive and prolonged, and can cause significant delay in the issuance of patents. Our pending patent applications or our issued patents, or those we have licensed and may license from others, may be drawn into interference proceedings or be challenged through post-grant review procedures or litigation, any of which could delay or prevent the issuance of patents, or result in the loss of issued patent rights. We may not be able to obtain from our past or future collaborators the information needed to support our patent rights which could result in the loss of important patent rights.\nUnder the AIA, interference proceedings between patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013 have been replaced with other types of proceedings, including derivation proceedings. The AIA also includes post-grant review procedures subjecting U.S. patents to post-grant review procedures similar to European oppositions, such as inter partes review, or IPR, covered business method post-grant reviews and other post-grant reviews. This applies to all of our U.S. patents and those we have licensed and may license from others, even those issued before March 16, 2013.\nBecause of a lower evidentiary standard necessary to invalidate a patent claim in Patent Office proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal court, a third-party could potentially provide evidence in a Patent Office proceeding sufficient for the Patent Office to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third-party could attempt to use the Patent Office procedures to invalidate patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third-party as a defendant in a district court action. U.S. patents owned or licensed by us may therefore be subject to post-grant review procedures, as well as other forms of review and re-examination. In addition, the IPR process under the AIA permits any person, whether they are accused of infringing the patent at issue or not, to challenge the validity of certain patents. As a result, entities associated with hedge funds have challenged valuable pharmaceutical patents through the IPR process. Significant impairment of our imetelstat patent rights would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, which might cause us to cease operations.\nCertain jurisdictions, such as Europe, New Zealand and Australia, permit oppositions to be filed against granted patents or patents proposed to be granted. Because we seek to enable potential global commercialization of imetelstat, securing both proprietary protection and freedom to operate outside of the United States is important to our business. Opposition proceedings require significant time and costs, and if we are unsuccessful or are unable to commit these types of resources to protect our imetelstat patent rights, we could lose our patent rights and we could be prevented or limited in the development and commercialization of imetelstat.\nAs more groups become engaged in scientific research and product development in the areas of telomerase biology and hematologic malignancies, the risk of our patents, or patents that we have in-licensed, being challenged through patent interferences, derivation proceedings, IPRs, post-grant proceedings, oppositions, re-examinations, litigation or other means will likely increase. For example, litigation may arise as a result of our decision to enforce our patent rights against third parties. Challenges to our patents through these procedures would be extremely expensive and time-consuming, even if the outcome was favorable to us. An adverse outcome in a patent dispute could severely harm our ability to further develop or commercialize imetelstat, or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, and might cause us to cease operations, by:\n\u2022\ncausing us to lose patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction(s);\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to litigation, or otherwise preventing us from commercializing imetelstat in the relevant jurisdiction(s);\n\u2022\nrequiring us to obtain licenses to the disputed patents;\n\u2022\nforcing us to cease using the disputed technology; or\n\u2022\nrequiring us to develop or obtain alternative technologies.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patents on imetelstat and our technologies in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States are less extensive than those in the United States. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly in developing countries; thus, even in countries where we do pursue patent protection, there can be no assurance that any patents will issue with claims that cover imetelstat and our technologies. There can be no assurance that we will obtain or maintain patent rights in or outside the United States under any future license agreements. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, even in jurisdictions where we pursue patent protection, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not pursued and obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with imetelstat and our technologies and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology and pharmaceutical products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights, even if obtained, in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. While we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in major markets for imetelstat, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market imetelstat. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop.\nWe may be subject to infringement claims that are costly to defend, and such claims may limit our ability to use disputed technologies and prevent us from pursuing research, development, manufacturing or commercialization of imetelstat.\nThe commercial success of imetelstat will depend upon our ability to research, develop, manufacture, market and sell imetelstat without infringing or otherwise violating the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and many pharmaceutical companies, including potential competitors, have substantial patent portfolios. In the event our technologies infringe the rights of others or require the use of discoveries and technologies controlled by third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing research, development, manufacturing or commercialization of imetelstat, or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or other proprietary rights or develop or obtain alternative technologies. For example, we are aware that certain third parties have or may be prosecuting patents and patent estates that may relate to imetelstat, and while we believe these patents will expire before imetelstat is able to be commercialized and/or that these patents are invalid and/or would not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of imetelstat, it is possible that the owner(s) of these patents will assert claims against us in the future. If that were to occur, we might need to obtain unblocking licenses from such third parties, develop alternative non-infringing technologies, which we may not be able to do at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms, or at all, or cease the development of imetelstat. In addition, while our past collaboration agreements have terminated, we are still subject to indemnification obligations to our collaborators, including with respect to claims of third-party patent infringement.\nSince we cannot be aware of all intellectual property rights potentially relating to imetelstat and its uses, we do not know with certainty that imetelstat, or the intended commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe or otherwise violate any third-party\u2019s intellectual property. Any infringement claims against us would likely be expensive to resolve, and the cost of any unblocking license that we could be required to obtain is unpredictable and could be significant. If we are unable to resolve an infringement claim successfully, we could be subject to an injunction that would prevent us from potentially commercializing imetelstat and could also require us to pay substantial damages. In addition to infringement claims, in the future we may also be subject to other claims relating to intellectual property, such as claims that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of third parties. Provided that we are successful in continuing the development of imetelstat, we expect to see more efforts by others to obtain patents that are positioned to cover imetelstat. Our success therefore depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and the proprietary rights of others.\nWe may become aware of discoveries and technologies controlled by third parties that are advantageous or necessary to further develop or manufacture imetelstat. Under such circumstances, we may initiate negotiations for licenses to other technologies as the need or opportunity arises. We may not be able to obtain a license to a technology required to pursue the research, development, manufacture or commercialization of imetelstat on commercially favorable terms, or at all, or such licenses may be terminated on certain grounds, including as a result of our failure to comply with the obligations under such licenses. If we do not obtain a necessary license or if such a license is terminated, we may need to redesign such technologies or obtain rights to alternative technologies, which may not be possible, and even if possible, could cause further delays in the development efforts for imetelstat and could increase the development and/or production costs of imetelstat. In cases where we are unable to license necessary technologies,\nwe could be subject to litigation and prevented from pursuing research, development, manufacturing or commercialization of imetelstat, which would materially and adversely impact our business. Failure by us to obtain rights to alternative technologies or a license to any technology that may be required to pursue research, development, manufacturing or commercialization of imetelstat would further delay current and potential future clinical trials of imetelstat and any applications for regulatory approval, impair our ability to sell imetelstat, if approved, and therefore result in decreased sales of imetelstat for us. Occurrence of any of these events would materially and adversely affect our business, and might cause us to cease operations.\nWe may become involved in disputes with past or future collaborator(s) over intellectual property inventorship, ownership or use, and publications by us, or by investigators, scientific consultants, research collaborators or others. Such disputes could impair our ability to obtain patent protection or protect our proprietary information, which, in either case, could have a significant impact on our business.\nInventions discovered under research, material transfer or other collaboration agreements may become jointly owned by us and the other party to such agreements in some cases, and may be the exclusive property of either party in other cases. Under some circumstances, it may be difficult to determine who invents and owns a particular invention, or whether it is jointly owned, and disputes can arise regarding inventorship, ownership and use of those inventions. These disputes could be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome could have a significant adverse effect on our business if we were not able to protect our license rights to these inventions. In addition, clinical trial investigators, scientific consultants and research collaborators generally have contractual rights to publish data and other proprietary information, subject to review by the trial sponsor. Publications by us, or by investigators, scientific consultants, previous employees, research collaborators or others, either with permission or in contravention of the terms of their agreements with us or without past or future collaborators, may impair our ability to obtain patent protection or protect proprietary information which would have a material adverse effect on our business, and might cause us to cease operations.\nMuch of the information and know-how that is critical to our business is not patentable, and we may not be able to prevent others from obtaining this information and establishing competitive enterprises.\nWe sometimes rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology, especially in circumstances in which we believe patent protection is not appropriate or available. We attempt to protect our proprietary technology in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and contractors. We cannot provide assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors, any of which would harm our business significantly.\nIn May 2016, the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, or the DTSA, was enacted, providing a federal cause of action for misappropriation of trade secrets. Under the DTSA, an employer may not collect enhanced damages or attorney fees from an employee or contractor in a trade secret dispute brought under the DTSA, unless certain advanced provisions are observed. We cannot provide assurance that our existing agreements with employees and contractors contain notice provisions that would enable us to seek enhanced damages or attorneys\u2019 fees in the event of any dispute for misappropriation of trade secrets brought under the DTSA.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems, including cloud-based systems, or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems, including cloud-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. Our computer and information technology systems, and those of our collaborators, service providers and contractors, are potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, malware, computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures that may result in damage to or the impairment of key business processes, or the loss or corruption of confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. Such disruptions and breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The costs to us to mitigate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology\nsystems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. In addition, we rely on our collaborators, service providers, including our CROs, and contractors to establish and maintain appropriate information technology systems and data security protections. However, except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control their actions related to such matters. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our imetelstat development program. For example, the loss of clinical trials data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in potential regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.\nIn addition, our computer and information technology systems, as well as those of our collaborators, service providers and contractors, are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches, whether by employees, contractors, consultants, malware, phishing attacks, or other cyber-attacks, that may expose confidential information, intellectual property, proprietary business information or personal information to unauthorized persons. If a data security breach affects our systems or those of third parties upon which we rely, corrupts our data or results in the unauthorized disclosure or release of personally identifiable information by our collaborators, service providers, contractors or us, our reputation could be materially damaged, and we could be subject to significant fines, increased costs or loss of revenue. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, supervisory bodies, credit reporting agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal, state and foreign data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations and guidelines, if applicable. These may include state breach notification laws, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or GDPR. Accordingly, a data security breach or privacy violation that leads to unauthorized access to, disclosure or modification of personal information (including protected health information), that prevents access to personal information or materially compromises the privacy, security, or confidentiality of the personal information, could result in fines, increased costs or loss of revenue as a result of:\n\u2022\nharm to our reputation;\n\u2022\nfines or penalties imposed on us by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nadditional compliance obligations or enforcement measures under federal, state or foreign laws;\n\u2022\nremediation and corrective action we undertake as required by law or as otherwise necessary;\n\u2022\nlitigation and potential civil or criminal liability; and\n\u2022\nrequirements to verify the accuracy of affected data.\nIf we are unable to prevent such data security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive patient data. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have implemented security measures to protect our computer and information technology systems, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently, become more sophisticated, and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we or our collaborators, service providers or contractors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to data security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nChanges in and failures to comply with U.S. and foreign privacy and data protection laws, regulations and standards may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to or affected by numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as regulatory guidance, governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal data, such as information that we collect about patients and healthcare providers in connection with clinical trials in the United States and abroad. Although we became Privacy Shield certified by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s International Trade Administration in April 2019, there is a risk that our Privacy Shield certification could be revoked or held by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction to be an invalid basis for the transfer of personal data outside of the European Economic Area. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, affect our or our collaborators\u2019, service providers\u2019 and contractors\u2019 ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use and share personal information, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our collaborators, service providers and contractors to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulation, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing processing of personal information could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising.\nIn the United States, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective in January 2020. The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents. The CCPA includes a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the CCPA), provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. It remains unclear how the CCPA will be interpreted, but as currently written, it may impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data. As we expand our operations, the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. Other states are beginning to pass similar laws.\nCompliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new data protection rules. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly.\nOur operations abroad may also be subject to increased scrutiny or attention from data protection authorities. Many countries in these regions have established or are in the process of establishing privacy and data security legal frameworks with which we, our collaborators, service providers, including our CROs, and contractors must comply. For example, the EU has adopted the GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018 and introduces strict requirements for processing the personal information of EU subjects, including clinical trial data. The GDPR has and will continue to increase compliance burdens on us, including by mandating potentially burdensome documentation requirements and granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and process information about them. The processing of sensitive personal data, such as physical health condition, may impose heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active interest among foreign regulators. In addition, the GDPR provides for more robust regulatory enforcement and fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. As we expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK AND FINANCIAL REPORTING\nHistorically, our stock price has been extremely volatile.\nHistorically, our stock price has been extremely volatile. Between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019, our stock has traded as high as $7.79 per share and as low as $0.91 per share. Between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019, the price has ranged between a high of $6.99 per share and a low of $0.95 per share. The significant market price fluctuations of our common stock have been due to and may in the future be influenced by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\ntermination of the Collaboration Agreement by Janssen in September 2018;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding the research and development of imetelstat, or results of, further delays in, discontinuation of, or further modifications or refinements to any clinical trials of imetelstat, including the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, for any reason, or our inability, for any reason, to successfully continue the development of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nobtaining the substantial additional capital, on commercially reasonable terms, necessary to advance the development of imetelstat, including completing the Phase 3 portion of IMerge and commencing, conducting and completing potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF or potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies;\n\u2022\npreliminary, interim or final clinical trial data reported with respect to current or potential future clinical trials of imetelstat, and investor perceptions thereof;\n\u2022\nnot receiving timely regulatory clearances or approvals in any jurisdiction, whether within or outside of the United States, including, if we do not obtain regulatory clearance to commence, modify, conduct or continue clinical trials of imetelstat in MF, MDS or any additional hematologic myeloid malignancies in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding the safety of imetelstat and partial or full clinical holds placed on the imetelstat INDs by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or other regulatory developments related to imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe experimental nature of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any future collaboration agreements for the development and potential commercialization of imetelstat in countries outside of the United States that we may establish;\n\u2022\nthe demand in the market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new commercial products, or clinical progress or lack thereof by us, potential future collaborative partners or our competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nincreased or continuing operating losses as a result of our sole financial responsibility for the development and potential future commercialization of imetelstat or otherwise;\n\u2022\ngeneral domestic and international market conditions or market conditions relating to the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning imetelstat proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ncomments by securities analysts or other third parties, including blogs, articles and other media;\n\u2022\nlarge stockholders exiting their position in our common stock or an increase in the short interest in our common stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements of or developments concerning pending and potential future litigation;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of common stock to partners, vendors or investors to raise additional capital; and\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of any other risks and uncertainties discussed under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nStock prices and trading volumes for many biopharmaceutical companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons, including factors which may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations, such as media coverage, statements made on message boards and social media forums, legislative and regulatory measures and the activities of various interest groups or organizations. In addition to the risk factors described in this section, overall market volatility, as well as general domestic or international economic, market and political conditions, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the return on your investment.\nIn addition, as further discussed in the Risk Factor above entitled \u201cWe and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in putative securities class action lawsuits. These lawsuits, and potential similar or related lawsuits, could result in substantial damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. These lawsuits, and any other lawsuits to which we are subject,\nwill be costly to defend or pursue and are uncertain in their outcome\u201d, we and two of our officers have been named as defendants in three putative class action lawsuits. Such lawsuits have often been instituted against companies, including us, whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. The pending lawsuits and any lawsuits brought against us in the future could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and results of operations and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could result in delays of the Phase 3 portion of IMerge and/or could preclude or delay potential future clinical trials, such as potential Phase 3 clinical trials in MF or potential proof-of-concept studies in other hematologic myeloid malignancies, or could preclude or delay commercialization efforts.\nWe may fail to continue to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq, and as a result our common stock may be delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC has requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on Nasdaq. In particular, Nasdaq rules require us to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share of our common stock. The closing bid price of our common stock has fluctuated below $1.00 per share in 2018, and while the price has fluctuated above $1.00 per share as well in that time period, in 2020 the closing bid price has been below $1.00 per share. If the closing bid price of our common stock were to remain below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, or we do not meet other listing requirements, we would fail to be in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards. There can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the minimum bid price requirement, or any other requirement in the future. If we fail to meet the minimum bid price requirement, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC may initiate the delisting process with a notification letter. If we were to receive such a notification, we would be afforded a grace period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, shares of our common stock would need to maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days. In addition, we may be unable to meet other applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders\u2019 equity or market values of our common stock, in which case our common stock could be delisted. If our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 450,000,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance and 199,814,581 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, we had reserved 45,395,620 shares of our common stock for future issuance pursuant to our option and equity incentive plans and outstanding warrant as of December 31, 2019. In addition, under the universal shelf registration statement filed by us in May 2018 and declared effective by the SEC in July 2018, we may sell any combination of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings, up to a cumulative value of $250 million.\nFuture sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur, or the issuance of common stock to fund our operations and imetelstat development, including pursuant to our 2018 Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR, could cause immediate dilution and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The sale or issuance of our securities, as well as the existence of outstanding options and shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our option and equity incentive plans and outstanding warrant, also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock and the return on your investment.\nOur undesignated preferred stock may inhibit potential acquisition bids; this may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides our board of directors with the authority to issue up to 3,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imported upon these shares without further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if in the future, we issue preferred stock that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nProvisions in our charter, bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us, which may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they believe may be the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers.\nProvisions of our charter documents and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management, including provisions that:\n\u2022\nprevent stockholders from taking actions by written consent;\n\u2022\ndivide the board of directors into separate classes with terms of office that are structured to prevent all of the directors from being elected in any one year; and\n\u2022\nset forth procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders\u2019 meetings.\nProvisions of Delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations. In addition, we have individual severance agreements with our executive officers and a company-wide severance plan, either of which could require a potential acquirer to pay a higher price. Either collectively or individually, these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers, including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf,\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our certificate of incorporation, or our bylaws, or\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nWhile the exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws do not apply to lawsuits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, these provisions may nonetheless limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current or former directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business and our financial condition.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Our annual reports on Form 10-K must contain an annual assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must provide an opinion annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe requirements of Section 404 are ongoing and also apply to future years. We expect that our internal control over financial reporting will continue to evolve as our business develops. Although we are committed to continue to improve our internal control processes and we will continue to diligently and vigorously review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with Section 404 requirements, any control system, regardless of how well designed, operated and evaluated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Therefore, we cannot be certain that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered in the future. If material weaknesses or other significant deficiencies occur, such weaknesses or deficiencies could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nRISKS RELATED TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS\nCompetitors may develop products, product candidates or technologies that are superior to or more cost-effective than ours, which may significantly impact the development and commercial viability of imetelstat, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by intense and dynamic competition with rapidly advancing technologies and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe our proprietary oligonucleotide chemistry; experience with the biological mechanisms related to imetelstat, telomeres and telomerase; clinical data to date indicating potential disease-modifying activity with imetelstat treatment; and knowledge and expertise around the development of potential treatments for hematologic myeloid malignancies provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Imetelstat will compete, if approved, with other products and therapies that currently exist, are being developed or will in the future be developed, some of which we may not currently be aware.\nIf approved for commercial sale for the treatment of lower risk MDS, imetelstat would compete against a number of currently existing therapies, including ESAs and other hematopoietic growth factors that are indicated for anemia; immunomodulators, such as Revlimid (lenalidomide) by Celgene Corporation, a Bristol-Myers Squibb Corporation, or Celgene; hypomethylating agents, such as Vidaza (azacitidine) by Celgene or other manufacturers of generic azacitidine, and Dacogen (decitabine) by Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc. and other manufacturers in the United States and Janssen in the EU.\nOther therapies currently in Phase 3 development in lower risk MDS, some of which may obtain regulatory approval earlier than imetelstat include, Reblozyl (luspatercept), a TGF-beta inhibitor, by Acceleron Pharma, Inc., or Acceleron, in collaboration with Celgene, whose new drug application (NDA) has been submitted to the FDA for potential approval; oral versions of azacitidine by Celgene; roxadustat, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, by FibroGen, Inc.; and APR-246, an activator of p53 protein, by Aprea Therapeutics, Inc.\nIf approved for commercial sale for the treatment of MF, imetelstat would compete against currently approved JAK inhibitors, Jakafi (ruxolitinib) by Incyte Corporation and Inrebic (fedratinib) by Celgene. Other treatment modalities for MF include hydroxyurea for the management of splenomegaly, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and constitutional symptoms; splenectomy and splenic irradiation for the management of splenomegaly and co-existing cytopenias, or low blood cell counts; chemotherapy and pegylated interferon. Drugs for the treatment of MF-associated anemia include ESAs, androgens, danazol, corticosteroids, thalidomide and lenalidomide.\nOther therapies currently in Phase 3 development in Intermediate-2 or High-Risk myelofibrosis, some of which may obtain regulatory approval earlier than imetelstat include pacritinib, a JAK inhibitor, by CTI Biopharma, and momelotinib, a JAK inhibitor, by Sierra Oncology. Non-JAK inhibitor approaches for MF currently under investigation that could compete with imetelstat in the future include CPI-0610, a BET inhibitor, by Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; luspatercept, a TGF-beta inhibitor, by Acceleron, in collaboration with Celgene; PRM-151, an anti-fibrosis antibody, by Promedior, Inc.; navitoclax , a BCLXL, BCL-2 and BCLW inhibitor, by AbbVie; LCL 161, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), by Novartis; and KRT-232, an inhibitor of MDM2, by Kartos Therapeutics, Inc.\nSmaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We anticipate increased competition in the future as new companies explore treatments for hematologic myeloid malignancies, which may significantly impact the commercial viability of imetelstat. Academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to imetelstat. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified development and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to the imetelstat program.\nMany of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, could have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. We believe that the commercial success of imetelstat is subject to a number of factors, including,\n\u2022\nproduct efficacy and safety;\n\u2022\nmethod of product administration;\n\u2022\ncost of manufacturing;\n\u2022\nthe timing and scope of regulatory consents;\n\u2022\nstatus of coverage and level of reimbursement;\n\u2022\nlevel of generic competition\n\u2022\nprice; and\n\u2022\npatent position, including potentially dominant patent positions of others.\nAs a result of the foregoing, competitors may develop more commercially desirable or affordable products than imetelstat, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we may be able to achieve with imetelstat. Competitors have developed, or are in the process of developing, technologies that are, or in the future may be, competitive to imetelstat. Some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing therapeutic effects similar or superior to those that may be demonstrated by imetelstat. Competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective, or less costly than imetelstat, or more convenient to administer to patients and, therefore, present a serious competitive threat to imetelstat. In addition, competitors may price their products below what we may determine to be an acceptable price for imetelstat, may receive better third-party payor coverage and/or reimbursement, or may be more cost-effective than imetelstat. Such competitive products or activities by competitors may render imetelstat obsolete, which may cause us to cease any further development or future commercialization of imetelstat, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.\nTo be commercially successful, imetelstat must be accepted by the health care community, which can be very slow to adopt or unreceptive to new technologies and products.\nIf approved for marketing, imetelstat may not achieve market acceptance since hospitals, physicians, patients or the medical community in general may decide not to accept and utilize imetelstat. If approved for commercial sale, imetelstat will compete with a number of conventional and widely accepted drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies. The degree of market acceptance of imetelstat will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which imetelstat is approved;\n\u2022\nthe country and/or regions within which imetelstat is approved;\n\u2022\nthe establishment and demonstration to the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe ability to demonstrate that imetelstat is superior to alternatives on the market at the time;\n\u2022\nthe ability to establish in the medical community the potential advantages of imetelstat over alternative treatment methods, including with respect to efficacy, safety, cost or route of administration;\n\u2022\nthe label and promotional claims allowed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for imetelstat, if any;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of imetelstat as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales, marketing and distribution support for imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe pricing of imetelstat;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by government and third-party payors; and\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage by third-party payors, including governmental authorities.\nThe established use of conventional products competitive with imetelstat may limit or preclude the potential for imetelstat to receive market acceptance upon any commercialization. We may be unable to demonstrate any pharmacoeconomic advantage for imetelstat compared to established or standard-of-care therapies, or newly developed therapies, for hematologic myeloid malignancies. Third-party payors may decide that any potential improvement that imetelstat may provide to clinical outcomes in hematologic myeloid malignancies is not adequate to justify the costs of treatment with imetelstat. If the health care community does not accept imetelstat for any of the foregoing reasons, or for any other reason, our ability to further develop or potentially commercialize imetelstat may be negatively impacted or precluded altogether, which would seriously and adversely affect our business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nIf acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for imetelstat is not obtained, the use of imetelstat could be severely limited.\nThe ability to successfully commercialize imetelstat, if approved, will depend significantly on obtaining acceptable prices and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to the patient from third-party payors. Government payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and the reimbursement levels. Assuming we obtain coverage for imetelstat by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. If imetelstat is approved for commercial sale, patients are unlikely to use it unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of its cost. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement will be critical to new product acceptance.\nGovernment authorities and other third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, such as by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices as a condition of coverage, are using restrictive formularies and preferred drug lists to leverage greater\ndiscounts in competitive classes, and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of imetelstat to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nWe cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for imetelstat, if approved for commercial sale, and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. There may also be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which marketing approval is obtained. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not successfully commercialize imetelstat, even if marketing approval is obtained, which would negatively impact our business and business prospects.\nThe adoption of health policy changes and health care reform in the United States may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could impact our business. Also, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing, including specialty drug pricing practices, in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and federal and state legislative activity designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the price of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for. While a number of reform measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse impact on our business and financial results. Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biologic product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payor or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures. Such policy actions could have a material adverse impact on future worldwide sales of imetelstat, if approved. For a discussion of health reform activity, see Item 1 \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-Reimbursement and Healthcare Reform.\u201d\nCost control initiatives also could decrease the price that we may receive for imetelstat in the future. If imetelstat is not considered cost-effective or adequate third-party reimbursement for the users of imetelstat cannot be obtained, then we may be unable to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in imetelstat. Any of these events would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and might cause us to cease operations.\nIf we fail to comply with federal, state and foreign healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse, transparency, and health information privacy and security laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback and false claims laws; data privacy and security laws; and transparency laws related to payments and/or other transfers of value made to physicians, other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research,\nmarket, sell and distribute any product of ours for which marketing approval is obtained. For details regarding the restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate see Item 1 \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation- Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations.\u201d Additionally, efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare, privacy and data security laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. For example, the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU, provides an enforcement authority and authorizes the imposition of large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process or control compared to prior EU law, including in clinical trials, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management\u2019s attention and increase our cost of doing business. Likewise, we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data protection in the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which has been characterized as the first \u201cGDPR-like\u201d privacy statute enacted in the United States because it mirrors a number of the key provisions in the GDPR, became effective on January 1, 2020, and we cannot determine the impact such laws, regulations and standards will have on our business. In any event, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare or privacy laws, including the GDPR, in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations.\nFederal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other healthcare and privacy-related regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.", "PERMNO": 83756, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "GERN"}
