As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance. The extent of this impact will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, restrictions on travel, temporary store closure requirements, changes in consumer confidence and spending, and the extent of any recession resulting from the pandemic. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, or its overall impact on our business and financial performance.\nClosures and Operational Restrictions of Our Retail Stores and Our Wholesale Customers\u2019 Stores\nWe may face recurring store closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all our physical locations because of evolving or new governmental restrictions, quarantine policies, or social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, materially adversely impacted by store closures and operational restrictions.\nConsumer fear about becoming ill with COVID-19 and recommendations and/or mandates from governmental authorities has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on traffic to stores. Any significant reduction in consumer visits to, or spending at, our wholesale customers\u2019 stores and our retail stores during and following this pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, a loss of sales and profits and other material adverse effects on our business and results of operations.\nDisruptions or Delays in Our Supply Chain\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental and port facility actions have caused delays in shipments of our products and could significantly impact our supply chain if the factories that manufacture our products, the distribution centers where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are further disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. More specifically, most of our manufacturers are in China and Vietnam. To date, the Chinese and Vietnamese governments have imposed certain restrictions on business operations and the movement of people and goods to limit the spread of COVID-19, including the temporary closure of some factories and businesses in China and restrictions on others in Vietnam. Further, product that is sent from third-party manufacturers to our domestic distribution center arrives via cargo ships at the ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach where operations have been disrupted. Any prolonged or subsequent disruptions or delays in shipments could result in additional negative impacts to the pricing of our products due to changes in the availability of inventory, increased shipping costs, or missed sales that may materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOffice Closures, Focus of Key Personnel and Productivity of Employees\nBeginning in early 2020, we temporarily closed many of our corporate offices and other facilities, including our corporate headquarters in Manhattan Beach, California, and implemented a policy for many of our corporate employees to work remotely. While we began to allow a limited number of personnel back to our corporate offices with added safety measures and staggered work schedules in June 2020, these evolving workplace arrangements may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business.\nIn addition, our management team has focused on mitigating the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has required and may continue to require a large investment of time and resources, diverting their attention from other priorities that existed prior to the pandemic. If these conditions worsen or last for an extended period, our ability to manage our business may be impaired and operational risks may be elevated.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic Has Had A Negative Impact On The Global Economy, And Our Sales Are Influenced By Economic Conditions That Impact Consumer Spending And Consumer Confidence.\nConsumer confidence and spending on discretionary items generally declines during periods of economic uncertainty or recession. Our wholesale customers anticipate and respond to adverse changes in economic conditions and uncertainty by reducing inventories and/or increasing promotional activity. Our retail stores are also affected by these conditions and may experience declines in consumer traffic and spending. As a result, factors that diminish consumer confidence and spending, particularly deterioration in general economic conditions, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, inflation, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on tourism and tourist spending, volatility in investment returns, fear of unemployment, increases in energy costs or taxes or interest rates, housing market downturns, fear about and impact of pandemic illness (such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced store traffic and widespread temporary store closures), and other factors such as acts of war, natural disasters or terrorist or political events that impact consumer confidence, have had, and may continue to have (with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic), a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition through their negative impact on our wholesale customers as well as decreased spending in our retail stores and potentially via our e-commerce business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur Future Success Depends On Our Ability To Maintain Our Brand Name And Image With Consumers.\nOur success to date has largely been due to the strength of the Skechers brand. Maintaining, promoting, and growing our brand depends on our ability to develop high-quality, innovative, and fashion forward products, as well as our ability to create fresh and relevant marketing and advertising campaigns. The inability to execute or adverse developments in these areas could negatively impact our brand. Our brand could also be negatively impacted if we or any of our products were to receive negative publicity of any kind. If we are unable to maintain, promote and grow our brand, then our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Future Success Also Depends On Our Ability To Respond To Changing Consumer Preferences, Identify And Interpret Consumer Trends, And Successfully Market New Products.\nThe footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences. The continued popularity of our footwear requires us to accurately identify changing consumer preferences and effectively respond in a timely manner. Demand for and market acceptance of existing and new products are uncertain and depend on the following factors:\n\u2022\nsubstantial investment in product innovation, design and development;\n\u2022\ncommitment to product quality; and\n\u2022\nsignificant and sustained marketing efforts and expenditures, including with respect to the monitoring of consumer trends.\nWe are often required to make decisions about product designs and marketing expenditures several months in advance of when consumer acceptance can be determined. As a result, we may not be successful in responding to shifting consumer preferences with new products that achieve market acceptance. If we fail to identify and effectively respond to changing consumer preferences, we could experience excess inventories, higher than normal markdowns, returns, order cancellations or an inability to profitably sell our products, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe Face Intense Competition, Including Competition From Companies In The Performance Footwear Market and With Significantly Greater Resources Than Ours, And If We Are Unable To Compete Effectively, Our Market Share May Decline And Our Business Could Be Harmed.\nWe face intense competition from other established companies in the footwear industry in the areas of product offerings, pricing, costs of production, and advertising and marketing expenditures. Consumer demand for our products may decline significantly if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the footwear industry, compete more effectively on price and production, more effectively keep up with rapid changes in footwear technology, and more quickly develop new products. New companies may also enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition. In addition, negative consumer perceptions of our performance features due to our historical reputation as a fashion and lifestyle footwear company may place us at a competitive disadvantage in the performance footwear market. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, cost increases, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our development and marketing of new products, which would materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Strategies Involve A Number Of Risks That Could Prevent Or Delay The Successful Opening Of New Stores As Well As Negatively Impact The Performance Of Our Existing Stores.\nOur ability to successfully open and operate new stores depends on many factors, including our ability to identify suitable store locations, the availability of which is outside of our control; negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances; source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of new stores; hire, train and retain store personnel; successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations; and satisfy the fashion preferences in new geographic areas.\nIn addition, new stores could be opened in regions in which we currently have few or no stores. Any expansion into new markets may present competitive, merchandising and distribution challenges that are different from those we encounter in our existing markets. Any of these challenges could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, any new store openings in existing markets could result in reduced sales in existing stores in those markets. We may decide to close stores that experience sales declines, which could result in additional costs, expenses, asset impairments or asset write-downs.\nOur Global Retail Business Has Required, And Will Continue To Require, A Substantial Investment And Commitment Of Resources And Is Subject To Numerous Risks And Uncertainties.\nOur global retail business has required substantial investments in leasehold improvements, inventory, and personnel. We have also made significant operating lease commitments for retail space worldwide. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our global retail business, the poor performance or closure of stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs or impairments of leasehold improvements, and employee-related termination costs. The success of our global retail operations also depends on our ability to identify and adapt to changes in consumer spending patterns and retail shopping preferences globally, including the shift from brick and mortar to direct-to-consumer and mobile channels. Our failure to successfully respond to these factors could adversely affect our retail business, as well as damage our brand and reputation, and could materially affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nMany Of Our Retail Stores Depend Heavily On The Customer Traffic Generated By Shopping And Factory Outlet Malls Or By Tourism.\nMany of our concept stores are in shopping malls and some of our factory outlet stores are in manufacturers\u2019 outlet malls. We depend on obtaining prominent locations and the overall success of the malls to generate customer traffic. The overall success of the malls can be negatively impacted by factors outside of our control, such as store closures by other retailers. Some of our concept stores occupy street locations that are heavily dependent on customer traffic generated by tourism. Tourism can be adversely affected by external factors such as an economic slowdown or social or political events. Any substantial decrease customer traffic generated by malls or tourism has, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on sales in our existing stores or hinder our ability to open retail stores in new markets, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe Depend On Key Personnel To Manage Our Business Effectively In A Rapidly Changing Market, And If We Are Unable To Retain Existing Personnel, Our Business Could Be Harmed.\nOur future success depends upon the continued services of Robert Greenberg, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Greenberg, President and a member of our Board of Directors; and David Weinberg, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and a member of our Board of Directors. The loss of the services of any of these individuals or any other key employee could harm us. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for employees in our industry is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nWe Have A Significant Work Force And Are Subject To Risks Related To Human Capital Management.\nWe employ approximately 11,700 employees worldwide and a significant portion of our operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits. Although we spend a significant amount of time and expense on human capital management, we cannot ensure that we will be able to maintain a happy and productive workforce. Some of our employees may leave or take other actions that harm our business.\nRisks Related to Supply Chain\nOur Business Could Be Harmed If We Fail To Maintain Proper Inventory Levels.\nWe place orders with our manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all our customers\u2019 orders. We do this to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders, and the risk of non-delivery. We also maintain an inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand. Any unanticipated decline in the popularity of Skechers footwear or other unforeseen circumstances may make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast demand, and we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory. Inventory levels exceeding customer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could significantly impair our brand image and have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products when we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, and diminish brand loyalty.\nOur International Sales And Manufacturing Operations Are Subject To The Risks Of Doing Business Abroad, Particularly In China and Vietnam, Which Could Affect Our Ability To Manufacture Or Sell Our Products, Obtain Products From Foreign Suppliers Or Control The Costs Of Our Products.\nSubstantially all our sales during the year ended December 31, 2021 were derived from sales of footwear manufactured in foreign countries, with most manufactured in China and Vietnam. We also sell our footwear in several foreign countries and plan to increase our international sales efforts as part of our growth strategy. Foreign manufacturing and sales are subject to a number of risks, including the following: political and social unrest, including terrorism; changing economic conditions, including higher labor costs; increased costs of raw materials; currency exchange rate fluctuations; labor shortages and work stoppages, including those due to the outbreak of a disease leading to an epidemic or pandemic spread; electrical shortages; transportation delays; loss or damage to products in transit; expropriation; nationalization; the adjustment, elimination or imposition of domestic and international duties, tariffs, quotas, import and export controls and other non-tariff barriers; exposure to different legal standards (particularly with respect to intellectual property); compliance with foreign laws; changes in domestic and foreign governmental policies; and the potential for circumstances where we may have to incur premium freight charges to expedite the delivery of product to our customers. If we incur a significant amount of premium charges to airfreight product for our customers and we are not able to collect those charges, our gross profit will be negatively affected. Apart from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply chain constraints, we have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risks, but we cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring or the resulting long-term adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn particular, because most of our products are manufactured in China and Vietnam, the possibility of adverse changes in trade or political relations with China or Vietnam, political instability in China or Vietnam, increases in labor costs, the occurrence of prolonged adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster such as an earthquake or typhoon in China or Vietnam, or the outbreak of a pandemic disease in China or Vietnam could severely interfere with the manufacturing and/or shipment of our products and would have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d). The government of the PRC has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate under the PRC may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, raw materials, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. Under its current leadership, the government of the PRC has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance, however, that the government of the PRC will continue to pursue these policies, or that it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice. A change in policies by the PRC government could adversely affect our interests\nby, among other factors: changes in laws, regulations or the interpretation thereof, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies, or the expropriation or nationalization of private enterprises.\nWe Rely On Independent Contract Manufacturers And, As A Result, Are Exposed To Disruptions In Product Supply.\nOur footwear products are currently manufactured by independent contract manufacturers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the top five manufacturers of our products produced approximately 37.1% of our total purchases. One manufacturer accounted for 18.0% of total purchases for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nWe compete with other footwear companies for production facilities, and we do not have long-term contracts with any of our contract manufacturers. Under our current arrangements with them, these manufacturers generally may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time. If our current manufacturers cease doing business with us, we could experience an interruption in the manufacture of our products. Although we believe that we could find alternative manufacturers, we may be unable to establish relationships with alternative manufacturers that will be as favorable as the relationships we have now. For example, new manufacturers may have higher prices, less favorable payment terms, lower manufacturing capacity, lower quality standards or higher lead times for delivery. If we are unable to provide products consistent with our standards or the manufacture of our footwear is delayed or becomes more expensive, our business and financial condition would be harmed.\nWhile not a material issue as of the filing date of this report, the COVID-19 pandemic previously led to the Chinese and Vietnamese governments imposing temporary closures of some of our factories in China and restrictions on others in Vietnam that caused delays in shipment of our products. We may encounter similar challenges yet again with these manufacturers, or new difficulties could arise with our manufacturers or any raw material suppliers on which our manufacturers rely, including prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, reductions in the availability of production capacity due to government imposed restrictions, failure to meet our quality control standards, failure to meet production deadlines or increased manufacturing costs. This could result in our customers canceling orders, refusing to accept deliveries or demanding reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a negative impact on our cash flows and harm our business and results of operations.\nOur Ability To Deliver Our Products To The Market Could Be Disrupted If We Encounter Problems Affecting Our Logistics And Distribution Systems.\nWe rely on owned or independently operated distribution facilities to transport, warehouse and ship products to our customers. Our logistics and distribution systems include computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. Substantially all our products are distributed from a few locations. Therefore, our operations could be interrupted by travel restrictions, earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution centers. Our business interruption insurance may not adequately protect us from the potential adverse effects of significant disruptions to our distribution system, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of brand image. In addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of product to and from our distribution facilities. If we encounter problems affecting our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales, and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Economic and External Factors\nThe Uncertainty Of Global Market Conditions May Continue To Have A Negative Impact On Our Business, Results Of Operations Or Financial Condition.\nThe uncertain state of global economic conditions, including the challenging consumer retail market, may negatively impact our business, which depends on the general economic environment and levels of consumers\u2019 discretionary spending. If the current economic situation does not improve or if it weakens, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales to existing customers, make sales to new customers, open and operate new retail stores, maintain sales levels at our existing stores, maintain or increase our international operations on a profitable basis, or maintain or improve our earnings from operations as a percentage of sales. Additionally, if there is an unexpected decline in sales, our results of operations will depend on our ability to implement a corresponding and timely reduction in our costs and manage other aspects of our operations. These challenges include (i) managing our infrastructure, (ii) hiring and maintaining, as required, the appropriate number of qualified employees, (iii) managing inventory levels and (iv) controlling other expenses. If the uncertain global market conditions continue for a significant period or worsen, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur Business Could Be Adversely Affected By Changes In The Business Or Financial Condition Of Our Customers Due To Global Economic Conditions.\nThe global financial crisis affected the banking system and financial markets and resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, more stringent lending standards and terms, and higher volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. In addition, our business could be adversely affected by other economic conditions, such as the insolvency of certain of our key distributors, which could impair our distribution channels, or the diminished liquidity or an inability to obtain credit to finance purchases of our product by our significant customers. Our customers may also experience weak demand for our products or other difficulties in their businesses. If economic, financial or political conditions in global markets deteriorate in the future, demand may be lower than forecasted and insufficient to achieve our anticipated financial results. Any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nNatural Disasters Or A Decline In Economic Conditions In California Could Increase Our Operating Expenses Or Adversely Affect Our Sales Revenue.\nA substantial portion of our operations are in California, including 98 of our retail stores, our headquarters in Manhattan Beach, and our North America distribution center in Rancho Belago. A decline in the economic conditions in California could have a material adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in California, such as an earthquake or wildfire, could significantly disrupt our business including the operation of our only domestic distribution center. We may be more susceptible to these issues than our competitors whose operations are not as concentrated in California.\nRisks Related to Currency\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations Could Have A Material Adverse Effect On Our Business And Results Of Operations.\nForeign currency fluctuations affect our revenue and profitability. Changes in currency exchange rates may impact our financial results positively or negatively in one period and not another, which may make it difficult to compare our operating results from different periods. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact third parties that manufacture our products by making their costs of raw materials or other production costs more expensive and more difficult to finance, thereby raising prices for us, our distributors and/or our licensees. We do not currently engage in hedging activities with respect to these currency exchange rate risks. For a more detailed discussion of the risks related to foreign currency fluctuation, see Item 7A: \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nIn addition, our foreign subsidiaries purchase products in U.S. dollars, which causes the cost of those products to vary depending on the foreign currency exchange rates and impacts the price charged to customers. Our foreign distributors also purchase products in U.S. dollars and sell in local currencies, which impacts the price to foreign consumers. As the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies, our revenues and profits are reduced when translated into U.S. dollars and our margins may be negatively impacted by the increase in product costs due to foreign currency exchange rates. Although we typically work to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations through price increases and further actions to reduce costs, we may not be able to fully offset the impact, if at all. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage or mitigate these foreign currency impacts, as changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nChanges In Tax Laws Or The Potential Imposition Of Additional Duties, Quotas, Tariffs And Other Trade Restrictions Could Have An Adverse Impact On Our Sales And Profitability.\nAll our products manufactured overseas and imported into the U.S., the European Union and other countries are subject to customs duties. We are unable to predict whether there may be unfavorable changes in tax laws in the U.S. or overseas, additional customs duties, quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism or other trade restrictions imposed on the importation of our products in the future. Such actions could adversely affect our ability to produce and market footwear at competitive prices and might have an adverse impact on the sales and profitability of Skechers.\nChanges to Trade Policy, Including New Tariffs Imposed By The U.S. Government, Could Have A Material Adverse Effect On Our Results Of Operations.\nChanges in social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the countries from which we import our products, or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. The U.S. government has placed or proposed additional tariffs on certain goods imported from China and may enact new tariffs on additional goods imported from China, including footwear and other products that we import. China had imposed tariffs on a wide range of American products in retaliation and responded to the new proposed tariff by, among other things, adjusting the value of its currency. China and the U.S. have made progress and are in discussions to finalize a trade agreement, however there is no guarantee that any agreement between the countries will be reached. China could impose additional tariffs or take other actions if the countries are unable to come to an agreement. Most of our products that we\nsell in the U.S. are manufactured in China. The U.S. government has also negotiated a replacement trade deal for NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (the \u201cUSMCA\u201d). There is also a concern that the imposition of additional tariffs by the U.S. could result in the adoption of additional tariffs by other countries as well. If the U.S. government does not reach a trade agreement with China or replaces NAFTA with USMCA, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the U.S. or other countries in connection with a global trade war, the resulting escalation of trade tensions could have a significant, adverse effect on world trade and the world economy. While it is too early to predict whether or how the recent policy changes will impact our business, the imposition of tariffs on footwear, apparel or other items imported by us from China could require us to increase prices to our customers or, if unable to do so, result in lowering our gross margin on products sold. Tariffs on footwear imported from China could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Business Could Be Harmed If Our Contract Manufacturers, Suppliers Or Licensees Violate Labor, Trade Or Other Laws.\nWe require our independent contract manufacturers, suppliers and licensees to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Manufacturers are required to certify that neither convicted, forced or indentured labor (as defined under U.S. law) nor child labor (as defined by law in the manufacturer\u2019s country) is used in the production process, that compensation is paid in accordance with local law and that their factories are in compliance with local safety regulations. Although we promote ethical business practices and our sourcing personnel periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent contract manufacturers, suppliers and licensees, we do not control them or their labor practices. If one of our independent contract manufacturers, suppliers or licensees violates labor or other laws or diverges from those labor practices generally accepted as ethical in the U.S., it could result in adverse publicity for us, damage our reputation in the U.S., or render our conduct of business in a particular foreign country undesirable or impractical, any of which could harm our business.\nIn addition, if we, or our foreign manufacturers, violate U.S. or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to extra duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and the forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import, or the loss of our import privileges. Possible violations of U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record-keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, quota category, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, fraudulent visas, or labor violations. The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, and have a negative impact on our operating results.\nThe Disruption, Expense And Potential Liability Associated With Existing And Unanticipated Future Litigation Against Us Could Have A Material Adverse Effect On Our Business, Results Of Operations, Financial Condition And Cash Flows.\nIn addition to the legal matters included in our reserve for loss contingencies, we occasionally become involved in litigation arising from the normal course of business, and we are unable to determine the extent of any liability that may arise from any such unanticipated future litigation. We have no reason to believe that there is a reasonable possibility or a probability that we may incur a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to any other such loss contingencies. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and assessments and decisions on defense and settlement can change significantly in a short period of time. Therefore, although we consider the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote with respect to those matters for which we have not reserved an amount for loss contingencies, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of our expectations, our consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, any unanticipated litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could also significantly divert management\u2019s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees being incurred. Such disruptions, legal fees and any losses resulting from these unanticipated future claims could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nOur Ability To Compete Could Be Jeopardized If We Are Unable To Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights Or If We Are Sued For Intellectual Property Infringement.\nWe believe that our trademarks, design patents and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We use trademarks on nearly all our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying us and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our Skechers\u00ae, Skechers Performance\u2122, Skechers GOrun\u00ae, Skechers GOwalk\u00ae, Skechers GOgolf\u00ae, Skechers GOtrain\u00ae, Skechers on-the-GO\u00ae, \u00ae, \u00ae, \u00ae, , Skechers Cali\u00ae, Skecher Street\u00ae, Skechers USA\u00ae, Skechers Active\u2122, Skechers Sport Active\u2122, Skechers Work\u2122, Skechers Max Cushioning\u2122, Mark Nason\u00ae, D\u2019Lites\u00ae, DLT-A\u00ae, BOBS\u00ae, Energy Lights\u00ae, Glide Step\u2122, Skech-Air\u00ae, Twinkle Toes\u00ae, Z-Strap\u00ae, Mega-Flex\u00ae, Luminators\u00ae, Heart Lights\u2122, Relaxed Fit\u00ae, Arch Fit\u2122, Ultra GO\u00ae, Hyper Burst\u00ae, Skechers Memory Foam\u2122, and Air-cooled Memory Foam\u00ae trademarks to be among our most valuable assets, and we have registered these trademarks in many countries. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. We also have a number of design patents and utility patents covering components and features used in various shoes. We believe that our patents and trademarks are sufficient to permit us to carry on our business as presently conducted. While we vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure patents or trademark protection for our intellectual property in the future or that protection will be adequate for future products. Further, we have been sued in the past for patent and trademark infringement and cannot be sure that our activities do not and will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are compelled to prosecute infringing parties, defend our intellectual property or defend ourselves from intellectual property claims\nmade by others, we may face significant expenses and liability as well as the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our business, which could negatively impact our business or financial condition.\nIn addition, the laws of foreign countries where we source and distribute our products may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. We cannot be assured that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights outside the U.S. will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or, if necessary, successfully challenge another party\u2019s counterfeit products or products that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights on the basis of trademark or patent infringement. Continued sales of counterfeit products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the U.S., and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nBreaches Or Compromises Of Our Information Security Systems, Information Technology Systems And Our Infrastructure To Support Our Business Could Result In Exposure Of Private Information, Disruption Of Our Business And Damage To Our Reputation, Which Could Harm Our Business, Results Of Operation And Financial Condition.\nAs a routine part of our business, we utilize information security and information technology systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or private information regarding our customers, employees, vendors and others. A security breach of our network, hosted service providers, or vendor systems, may expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks, and the retail industry, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. Although we take measures to safeguard this sensitive information, we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks targeted at us, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants.\nWe invest in industry standard security technology to protect personal information. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect against transaction or other data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur due to non-technical issues, including breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Although we maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for cyber risks related to what we believe to be adequate and collectible insurance in the event of theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or company data, any compromise or breach of our cyber security systems could result in private information exposure and a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant potential liability including legal and financial costs, and loss of confidence in our security measures by customers, which could result in damage to our brand and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data. Compliance with existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\nRisks Related to Our Stock and Stock Price\nOur Quarterly Revenues And Operating Results Fluctuate As A Result Of A Variety Of Factors, Including Seasonal Fluctuations In Demand For Footwear, Delivery Date Delays And Potential Fluctuations In Our Estimated Annualized Tax Rate, Which May Result In Volatility Of Our Stock Price.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and can be expected to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our major customers have no obligation to purchase forecasted amounts and from time to time cancel orders, change delivery schedules, or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice and without penalty. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Furthermore, our expenses are partially based on our expectations of future sales, and we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shifts. As a result, our expenses may be disproportionately large relative to our revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur annualized tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary at the end of each quarter. Any quarterly fluctuations in our annualized tax rate could have a material impact on our quarterly operating results and the results for any one quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. Any shortfall in revenues or net earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors could cause a decrease in the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nOne Principal Stockholder Is Able To Substantially Control All Matters Requiring Approval By Our Stockholders And Another Stockholder Is Able To Exert Significant Influence Over All Matters Requiring A Vote Of Our Stockholders, And Their Interests May Differ From The Interests Of Our Other Stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Robert Greenberg, beneficially owned 86.8% of our outstanding Class B Common Stock, members of Mr. Greenberg\u2019s immediate family beneficially owned an additional 8.2% of our outstanding Class B Common Stock, and Gil Schwartzberg, trustee of several trusts formed by Mr. Greenberg and his wife for estate planning purposes, beneficially owned 29.9% of our outstanding Class B Common Stock. The holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock have identical rights except that holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share while holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. As a result, as of December 31, 2021, Mr. Greenberg beneficially owned 37.4% of the aggregate number of votes eligible to be cast by our stockholders, and together with shares beneficially owned by other members of his immediate family, Mr. Greenberg and his immediate family beneficially owned 42.9% of the aggregate number of votes eligible to be cast by our stockholders, and Mr. Schwartzberg beneficially owned 18.0% of the aggregate number of votes eligible to be cast by our stockholders. Therefore, Messrs. Greenberg and Schwartzberg are each able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders. Matters that require the approval of our stockholders include the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. Mr. Greenberg also has significant influence over our management and operations. As a result of such influence, certain transactions are not likely without the approval of Messrs. Greenberg and Schwartzberg, including proxy contests, tender offers, open market purchase programs or other transactions that can give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for their shares of our Class A Common Stock. Because Messrs. Greenberg\u2019s and Schwartzberg\u2019s interests may differ from the interests of the other stockholders, their ability to substantially control or significantly influence, respectively, actions requiring stockholder approval, may result in the Company taking action that is not in the interests of all stockholders. The differential in the voting rights may also adversely affect the value of our Class A Common Stock to the extent that investors or any potential future purchaser view the superior voting rights of our Class B Common Stock to have value.\nOur Charter Documents And Delaware Law May Inhibit A Takeover, Which May Adversely Affect The Value Of Our Stock.\nProvisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. Mr. Greenberg\u2019s substantial beneficial ownership position, together with the authorization of Preferred Stock, the disparate voting rights between our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, the classification of our Board of Directors and the lack of cumulative voting in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, may discourage bids for our Class A Common Stock at a premium over the market price of the Class A Common Stock and may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 86949, "SIC": 3140, "TIC": "SKX"}
