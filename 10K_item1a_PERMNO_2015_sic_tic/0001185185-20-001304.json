Risk Factors\nThe Company faces a variety of significant and diverse risks, many of which are inherent in the business. Described below are certain risks that could materially affect the Company. Other risks and uncertainties that the Company does not presently consider to be material, or of which the Company is not presently aware, may become important factors that affect it in the future. The occurrence of any of the risks discussed below could materially and adversely affect the business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow.\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive.\nCompetition in the investment management business is based on a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nInvestment performance;\n\u25cf\nInvestor perception of an investment team\u2019s drive, focus, and alignment of interest with them;\n\u25cf\nQuality of service provided to, and duration of relationships with, clients and shareholders;\n\u25cf\nBusiness reputation; and\n\u25cf\nLevel of fees charged for services.\nThe Company competes with a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies, and other financial institutions. Competitive risk is heightened by the fact that some competitors may invest according to different investment styles or in alternative asset classes which the markets may perceive as more attractive than the Company\u2019s investment approach. If the Company is unable to compete effectively, revenues and earnings may be reduced, and the business could be materially affected.\nPoor investment performance could lead to a decline in revenues.\nSuccess in the investment management industry is largely dependent on investment performance relative to market conditions and the performance of competing products. Good relative performance generally attracts additional assets under management, resulting in additional revenues. Conversely, poor performance generally results in decreased sales and increased redemptions with a corresponding decrease in revenues. Therefore, poor investment performance relative to the portfolio benchmarks and to competitors could impair the Company\u2019s revenues and growth. The equity funds within USGIF have a performance fee whereby the base advisory fee is adjusted upwards or downwards by 0.25 percent if there is a performance difference of 5 percent or more between a Fund\u2019s performance and that of its designated benchmark index over the prior rolling 12 months.\nThe Company\u2019s clients can terminate their agreements with the Company on short notice, which may lead to unexpected declines in revenue and profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s investment advisory agreements are generally terminable on short notice and subject to annual renewal. If the Company\u2019s investment advisory agreements are terminated, which may occur in a short time frame, the Company may experience a decline in revenues and profitability.\nNatural disasters, global pandemics and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations.\nNatural disasters, outbreaks of epidemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other unpredictable events could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, and net income by:\n\u25cf\ndecreasing investment valuations in, and returns on, the investment portfolios that we manage and our corporate portfolio, thus causing reductions and volatility in revenue,\n\u25cf\ncausing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive,\n\u25cf\nincapacitating or reducing the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities,\n\u25cf\ninterrupting the Company\u2019s business operations or those of critical service providers,\n\u25cf\ntriggering technology delays or failures, and\n\u25cf\nrequiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage, replace our facilities, and restore our operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business operations are concentrated in San Antonio, Texas. The Company has developed various backup systems and contingency plans but cannot be assured that those preparations will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise, or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur. The Company also relies to varying degrees on outside vendors for service delivery in addition to technology and disaster contingency support, and there is a risk that these vendors will not be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner. If the Company loses the availability of employees, or if it is unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner, revenues, expenses, and net income could be negatively impacted.\nSpecifically, the effects of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) since December 2019 have negatively affected the global economy, the United States economy and the global financial markets, and may disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and the Company\u2019s clients' operations, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Although the long-term effects of the current pandemic cannot currently be predicted, previous occurrences of other pandemic and epidemic diseases had an adverse effect on the economies of those countries in which they were most prevalent. A recurrence of an outbreak of any kind of epidemic, communicable disease or virus or major public health issue could cause a slowdown in the levels of economic activity generally, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operations.\nDifficult market conditions can adversely affect the Company by reducing the market value of the assets we manage or causing shareholders to make significant redemptions.\nChanges in economic or market conditions may adversely affect the profitability, performance of and demand for the Company\u2019s investment products and services. Under the Company\u2019s advisory fee arrangements, the fees received are primarily based on the market value of assets under management. Accordingly, a decline in the price of securities held in funds under management would be expected to cause revenues and net income to decline, which would result in lower advisory fees, or cause increased shareholder redemptions in favor of investments they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk, which redemptions would also result in lower advisory fees. The ability of the Company to compete and grow is dependent on the relative attractiveness of the types of investment products the Company offers and its investment performance and strategies under prevailing market conditions.\nMarket-specific risks may negatively impact the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe Company manages certain funds in the emerging market and natural resources sectors, which are highly cyclical. The investments in the funds are subject to significant loss due to political, economic and diplomatic developments, currency fluctuations, social instability, and changes in governmental policies, including trading policies, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers. Foreign trading markets, particularly in some emerging market countries, are often smaller, less liquid, less regulated and significantly more volatile than the U.S. and other established markets.\nThe market price and trading volume of the Company\u2019s class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s class A common stock may be volatile and the trading volume may fluctuate, causing significant price variations to occur. If the market price of the Company\u2019s class A common stock declines significantly, stockholders may be unable to sell their shares at or above their purchase price. The Company cannot assure that the market price of its class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of the Company\u2019s class A common stock, or result in fluctuations in price or trading volume, include:\n\u25cf\nDecreases in assets under management;\n\u25cf\nVariations in quarterly and annual operating results;\n\u25cf\nVolatility in realized and unrealized gains or losses on corporate investments;\n\u25cf\nPublication of research reports about the Company or the investment management industry;\n\u25cf\nDepartures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nAdverse market reactions to any indebtedness the Company may incur, acquisitions or disposals the Company may make, or securities the Company may issue in the future;\n\u25cf\nChanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf\nChanges or proposed changes in laws or regulations, or differing interpretations thereof, affecting the business, or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters;\n\u25cf\nAdverse publicity about the asset management industry, generally, or individual scandals, specifically; and\n\u25cf\nGeneral market and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the Company has invested in a security in the cryptocurrency mining industry through its corporate investments and indirectly through an investment accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Cryptocurrency markets and related stocks have been, and are expected to continue to be, volatile. This volatility may materially impact the Company\u2019s financial statements and thus affect the Company\u2019s common stock market price. In addition, the price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate to the extent that shareholders invest in the Company\u2019s common stock as a proxy for cryptocurrency. The investing public may be influenced by future anticipated appreciation or depreciation in value of cryptocurrencies or blockchain generally, factors over which the Company has little or no influence or control. The Company\u2019s stock price may also be subject to volatility due to supply and demand factors associated with few or limited public company options for investment in the segment, which may change over time.\nInvestment income and assets may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in the Company\u2019s corporate investments.\nThe Company currently has a substantial portion of its assets in corporate investments. These investments are subject to investment market risk, and investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon disposition of investments or the recognition of significant unrealized losses or impairments. Fluctuations in investment income are expected to continue in the future.\nThe Company has exposure to the cryptocurrency markets through its investments.\nThe Company has invested in a security in the cryptocurrency mining industry through its corporate investments and indirectly through an investment accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Cryptocurrency markets and related stocks have been, and are expected to continue to be, volatile. There is potential for significant volatility in the valuation of the Company\u2019s cryptocurrency-related investments.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s class A common stock could decline due to the large number of shares of the Company\u2019s class C common stock eligible for future sale upon conversion to class A shares.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of class A common stock eligible for future sale upon the conversion of class C shares, or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for the Company to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price the Company deems appropriate.\nFailure to comply with government regulations could result in fines, which could cause the Company\u2019s earnings and stock price to decline.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of federal securities laws and agencies, including, but not limited to, the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act, the S-Ox Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the SEC, FINRA, and NASDAQ. Moreover, financial reporting requirements and the processes, controls, and procedures that have been put in place to address them, are comprehensive and complex. While management has focused attention and resources on compliance policies and procedures, non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, sanctions or censures which could affect the Company\u2019s reputation, and thus its revenues and earnings.\nOur business is subject to substantial risk from litigation, regulatory investigations and potential securities laws liability.\nMany aspects of U.S. Global\u2019s business involve substantial risks of litigation, regulatory investigations and/or arbitration. The Company is exposed to liability under federal and state securities laws, other federal and state laws and court decisions, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. U.S. Global, its subsidiaries, and/or officers could be named as parties in legal actions, regulatory investigations and proceedings. An adverse resolution of any lawsuit, legal or regulatory proceeding or claim against the Company could result in substantial costs or reputational harm to the Company, and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations, which, in turn, may negatively affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock and U.S. Global\u2019s ability to pay dividends. In addition to these financial costs and risks, the defense of litigation or arbitration may divert resources and management\u2019s attention from operations.\nHigher insurance premiums and related insurance coverage risks could increase costs and reduce profitability.\nWhile U.S. Global carries insurance in amounts and under terms that it believes are appropriate, the Company cannot assure that its insurance will cover most liabilities and losses to which it may be exposed, or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees. U.S. Global is subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation. An adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties. From time to time, various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including employment-related claims. There has been increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years, including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. As U.S. Global\u2019s insurance policies come up for renewal, the Company may need to assume higher deductibles or co-insurance liabilities, or pay higher premiums, which would increase the Company\u2019s expenses and reduce net income.\nIncreased regulatory and legislative actions and reforms could increase costs and negatively impact the Company\u2019s profitability and future financial results.\nThe Company is subject to financial services laws, regulations, corporate governance requirements, administrative actions and policies. During the past two decades, federal securities laws have been substantially augmented and made significantly more complex by the S-Ox Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). With new laws and changes in interpretations and enforcement of existing requirements, the associated time the Company must dedicate to, and related costs the Company must incur in, meeting the regulatory complexities of the business have increased. In order to comply with these requirements, the Company has had to expend additional time and resources. Future changes in financial institution regulation may increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of operations.\nFurther, adverse results of regulatory investigations of mutual fund, investment advisory, and financial services firms could tarnish the reputation of the financial services industry generally, and mutual funds and investment advisers more specifically, causing investors to avoid further fund investments or redeem their balances. Redemptions would decrease the Company\u2019s assets under management, which would reduce its advisory revenues and net income.\nThe Company intends to pay regular dividends to its stockholders, but the ability to do so is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nThe Company intends to pay cash dividends on a monthly basis, but the Board of Directors, at its discretion, may decrease the level or frequency of dividends or discontinue payment of dividends entirely based on earnings, operations, capital requirements, general financial condition of the Company, and general business conditions.\nOne person beneficially owns substantially all of our voting stock and controls the outcome of all matters requiring a vote of stockholders, which may influence the value of our publicly traded non-voting stock.\nFrank Holmes, CEO, is the beneficial owner of over 99 percent of our class C voting convertible common stock and controls the outcome of all issues requiring a vote of stockholders. All of our publicly traded stock is nonvoting stock. Consequently, except to the extent provided by law, stockholders other than Frank Holmes have no vote with respect to the election of directors or any other matter requiring a vote of stockholders. This lack of voting rights may adversely affect the market value of the publicly traded class A nonvoting common stock.\nThe loss of key personnel could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe success of the Company depends on key personnel, including the portfolio managers, analysts, and executive officers. Competition for qualified, motivated, and skilled personnel in the asset management industry remains significant. Moreover, in order to retain certain key personnel, the Company may be required to increase compensation to such individuals, resulting in additional expense. The loss of key personnel or the Company\u2019s failure to attract replacement personnel could negatively affect its financial performance.\nThe Company could be subject to losses if it fails to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s normal operations, it maintains and transmits certain confidential information about the Company and its clients as well as proprietary information relating to its business operations. These systems could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code, or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information. Such a breach could subject the Company to liability for a failure to safeguard client data, result in the termination of relationships with our existing customers, require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach and subject the Company to regulatory action.\nWe rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business, and the failure of any critical information system, including a cyber-security breach, may result in harm to our business.\nWe are heavily dependent on technology infrastructure and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include data network and telecommunications, internet access and our websites, and various computer hardware equipment and software applications. These information systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cyber-attacks and other events to the extent that these information systems are under our control. We have implemented measures, such as virus protection software, intrusion detection systems and emergency recovery processes to address the outlined risks. However, security measures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe. Any compromise of our data security or our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business and subject us to additional costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Finally, federal legislation relating to cyber-security threats could impose additional requirements on our operations.\nAdverse changes in foreign currencies could negatively impact financial results.\nWe have certain corporate investments held in foreign currencies. Adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates would also lower the value of those corporate investments. Certain assets under management also have exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in various markets, which could impact their valuation and thus the revenue we receive.\nAcquisitions involve inherent risks that could compromise the success of the combined business and dilute the holdings of current stockholders.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue corporate development transactions, including the acquisition of asset management firms. These transactions involve assessing the value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities and potential profitability of the transactions, and if our assessment is incorrect, the success of the combined business could be jeopardized. In addition, such transactions are subject to acquisition costs and expenses, are likely to divert the attention of management\u2019s time, and can dilute the stockholders of the combined company if the acquisition is made for stock of the combined company.", "PERMNO": 91287, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "GROW"}
