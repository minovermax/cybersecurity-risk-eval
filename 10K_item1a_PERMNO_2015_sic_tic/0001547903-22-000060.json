Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as all of the other information contained in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, before deciding to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" on page 3 of this report. Our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, including any such statements made in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could materially adversely affect our business, operations and financial results:\nRisk Related to Our Business Operations\n\u2022We face intense competition for business in our industry, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may not be able to achieve our business goals, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022Our NIW volumes could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private MI.\n\u2022If we are unable to continue to attract and retain the most significant mortgage originators as customers, our ability to achieve our business goals could be negatively impacted.\n\u2022If the volume of high-LTV loan originations declines, our NIW volume could decline, which would reduce our revenues.\n\u2022Our underwriting and credit risk management policies and practices may not anticipate all risks and/or the magnitude of potential for loss as the result of unforeseen risks.\n\u2022Unexpected material increases in borrower defaults could cause our actual losses to materially exceed our expected loss rates, including in certain geographic regions in which our business may be concentrated and more susceptible to downturns.\n\u2022The premiums we charge may be insufficient to cover claim payments and our operating costs.\n\u2022Changes in factors that impact the length of time that our policies remain in force may adversely affect our future revenues and claims experience.\n\u2022Increases in inflation may have an impact on our business performance and operations.\n\u2022We are outsourcing the underwriting of our mortgage insurance on certain loans to third-party underwriting service providers (USPs). If these USPs fail to adequately perform their underwriting services or place our coverage on loans we would deem ineligible, we could experience increased claims on loans underwritten by them and our customer relationships could be negatively impacted.\n\u2022Our Master Policies contain restrictions on our ability to rescind coverage for certain material misrepresentations (including fraud) and underwriting defects, and if we were to fail to timely discover any such misrepresentations or underwriting defects, our rights of rescission would be significantly limited, and we could suffer increased losses as a result of paying claims on loans with unacceptable risk characteristics.\n\u2022The mix of business we write affects our revenue stream and the likelihood of losses occurring.\n\u2022We expect our claims to increase as our insured loan portfolio grows and matures.\n\u2022Our business depends, in part, on effective and reliable loan servicing.\n\u2022If the estimates we use in establishing claims reserves are incorrect, the actual claim payments we make may materially exceed the amount of our corresponding claims reserves, resulting in unexpected charges to income, which could be material and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to materially adversely impact our financial results and may also materially adversely affect our business, liquidity and financial condition.\n\u2022The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or pandemics other than COVID-19 could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022We are exposed to certain risks associated with our third-party reinsurance transactions, including the possibility that our reinsurers will fail to perform their obligations or that we will lose the capital credit we expected to receive when we entered\ninto the transactions as a result of future GSE or Wisconsin OCI action or if any of our reinsurers experiences a downgrade or other adverse business event.\n\u2022Our operating results depend in large part on our ability to manage the risks related to the growth of our business and on maintaining and enhancing effective operating procedures and internal controls.\n\u2022We are exposed to operational risk from fraud, malfeasance or error by employees and third-party service providers, and any such fraud, malfeasance or error could materially and adversely affect us.\n\u2022If we do not maintain connectivity with or otherwise meet the technological demands of our customers or are unable to develop, enhance and maintain our proprietary technology platform, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\n\u2022We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or misuse of confidential, personal or proprietary information.\n\u2022Adverse investment performance may affect our financial results and ability to conduct business.\n\u2022We face regulatory and litigation risks associated with offering loan review services.\nRisk Related to Regulation of the Mortgage Insurance Industry\n\u2022There can be no assurance that the GSEs will continue to treat us as an approved insurer in the future, and our failure to maintain compliance with the GSEs' PMIERs could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, including a decision to decrease or discontinue the use of private MI, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses.\n\u2022We are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and capital adequacy requirements, which we must satisfy to continue to operate our MI business.\n\u2022The private MI industry is, and as a participant we are, subject to litigation and regulatory enforcement risk generally.\n\u2022Our business prospects and operating results could be adversely impacted if, and to the extent that, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's ATR Rules defining a QM negatively impact the size of the origination market.\n\u2022The Company may be adversely impacted by the phasing out of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).\nRisks Related to Our Holding Company and Capital Structure\n\u2022Our holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations and potentially require us to raise more capital.\n\u2022Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\n\u2022Our existing, and any future, variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.\n\u2022Despite our substantial level of debt, we may incur more debt, which could exacerbate any or all of the risks described above.\n\u2022Our current credit ratings may adversely affect our ability to access capital and the cost of such capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nGeneral Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\u2022We do not currently pay any dividends on our common stock and may not do so in the future, and payment of any declared dividends may be delayed.\n\u2022The market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline.\n\u2022The market price of our common stock could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale, and future issuances of our common stock may depress our share price and dilute the book value of our common stock.\n\u2022Future issuance of debt or preferred stock, which would rank senior to our Class A common stock upon our liquidation, may adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\n\u2022Provisions contained in our organizational documents, as well as provisions of Delaware law and Wisconsin insurance law, could delay or prevent a change of control of us, which could adversely affect the price of shares of our common stock.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nWe face intense competition for business in our industry, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may not be able to achieve our business goals, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe MI industry is highly competitive. With six private MI companies actively competing for business from the same residential mortgage originators, it is important that we continue to differentiate ourselves from the other mortgage insurers, each of which sells substantially similar products to ours. One or more of our competitors may seek to capture increased market share from the government MIs or from other private mortgage insurers by reducing prices, offering alternative coverage and product options, including offerings for loans not intended to be sold to the GSEs, loosening their underwriting guidelines or relaxing risk management policies, which could, in turn, improve their competitive positions in the industry and negatively impact our ability to achieve our business goals. Competition within the private mortgage insurance industry could result in our loss of customers, lower premiums, riskier credit guidelines and other changes that could lower our revenues or increase our expenses. If our IT systems are inferior to our competitors', existing and potential customers may choose our competitors' products over ours. If we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors and attract and retain our target customers, our revenue may be adversely impacted, which could adversely impact our growth and profitability.\nIn addition, we and most of our competitors, either directly or indirectly, offer certain ancillary services to mortgage lenders with which we also conduct MI business, including loan review, training and other services. For various reasons, including those related to resources or compliance, we may choose not to offer some or all of these services or not to offer them in a form or to the extent that is similar to the prevailing offerings of our competitors. If we choose not to offer these services, or if we were to offer ancillary services that are not well-received by the market and fail to perform as anticipated, we could be at a competitive disadvantage which could adversely impact our profitability.\nCertain of our competitors are subsidiaries of larger and more diversified corporations that may have access to greater amounts of capital and financial resources than we do, or a lower cost of capital, and some have better financial strength ratings than we have. As a result, they may be better positioned to compete in and outside of the traditional MI market, including when the GSEs pursue alternative forms of credit enhancement or credit risk transfer other than private MI, such as their IMAGIN and EPMI programs that were discontinued in 2021, but could be relaunched in the same or alternative form in the future.\nOur financial strength ratings are important for our customers to maintain confidence in our products and our competitive position. PMIERs require all approved insurers, except newly-approved insurers, to maintain at least one rating with a rating agency acceptable to the GSEs. A downgrade in NMIC's ratings or ratings outlook, or our failure to maintain a rating acceptable to one or both of the GSEs, could have an adverse effect on our business, including (i) potentially impacting our eligibility as an approved insurer, (ii) increased scrutiny of our financial condition by our customers, resulting in potential reduction in our NIW or (iii) negative impacts to our ability to conduct business in the non-GSE mortgage market, where financial strength ratings may be a more important counter-party consideration for lenders.\nOur NIW volumes could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private MI.\nIf lenders and investors select alternatives to private MI on high-LTV loans, our business could be adversely affected. These alternatives to private MI include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022lenders using government mortgage insurance programs, including those of the FHA, USDA and VA, and state-supported mortgage insurance funds in several states, including Massachusetts and California;\n\u2022lenders and other investors holding mortgages in their portfolios and self-insuring;\n\u2022GSEs and other investors using credit enhancements other than MI (including alternative forms of credit risk transfer such as the now discontinued IMAGIN and EPMI programs that could be relaunched in the future), using other credit enhancements in conjunction with reduced levels of MI coverage, or accepting credit risk without credit enhancement;\n\u2022lenders originating mortgages using \"piggy-back\" or other structures to avoid MI, such as a first mortgage with an 80% LTV and a second mortgage with a 10%, 15% or 20% LTV (referred to as 80-10-10, 80-15-5 or 80-20 loans, respectively) rather than a first mortgage with an LTV above 80% that has MI; and\n\u2022borrowers paying cash or making large down payments versus securing mortgage financing.\nAny of these alternatives to private MI could reduce or eliminate the need for our products, could cause us to lose business and/or could limit our ability to attract the business that we would prefer to insure.\nFurther, at the direction of the FHFA, the GSEs have expanded their credit and mortgage risk transfer programs. These programs have included the use of structured finance vehicles, obtaining insurance from non-mortgage insurers (e.g., IMAGIN and EPMI), including off-shore reinsurance, engaging in credit-linked note transactions in the capital markets, or using other forms of debt issuances or securitizations that transfer credit risk directly to other investors. The growing success of these programs and the perception that some of these risk-sharing structures have beneficial features in comparison to private MI (e.g., lower costs, reduced counter-party risk due to collateral requirements or more diversified insurance exposures) may create increased competition for private MI on loans traditionally sold to the GSEs with private MI.\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, the government MIs, principally the FHA and VA, captured an increasing share of the high-LTV MI market. While declining from peak market share, government MIs' market share remains substantially above their historical levels. Government mortgage insurance programs are not subject to the same capital requirements, costs of capital, risk tolerance or business objectives that we and other private mortgage insurers are, and therefore, generally have greater financial flexibility in setting their pricing, guidelines and capacity, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Although there has been broad policy consensus toward the need for private capital to play a larger role and government credit risk to be reduced in the U.S. housing finance system, it remains difficult to predict whether the combined market share of the government MIs will recede to pre-2008 levels. These agencies may continue to maintain a strong combined market position and could increase their market share in the future.\nFactors that could cause government-supported mortgage insurance programs to remain significant include:\n\u2022change to federal housing policy and/or priorities, including government MIs reducing their premiums, which may be more likely under the current Presidential administration, or loosening their underwriting guidelines;\n\u2022increase in premium rates or tightening of underwriting guidelines by private mortgage insurers;\n\u2022capital constraints in the private MI industry;\n\u2022increase in capital requirements imposed on private mortgage insurers by the GSEs or states;\n\u2022continuation of increases to or imposition of new GSE loan delivery fees on loans that require MI, which may result in higher borrower costs for MI loans compared to loans insured by government MIs;\n\u2022loans insured under federal government-supported mortgage insurance programs are eligible for securitization in Ginnie Mae securities, which may be viewed by investors as more desirable than GSE securities due to the explicit backing of Ginnie Mae securities by the full faith and credit of the U.S. federal government;\n\u2022difference in the spread between GSE mortgage-backed securities and Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities;\n\u2022increase in government MIs' loan limits above GSE loan limits;\n\u2022change in GSEs' demand to participate in the high-LTV or first-time homebuyer origination market; and\n\u2022perceived operational ease of using insurance from government MIs compared to private MI.\nIf the government MIs maintain or increase their share of the mortgage insurance market, our business and industry could be negatively affected.\nThe degree to which lenders or borrowers may select these alternatives now, or in the future, is difficult to predict. As one or more of the alternatives described above, or new alternatives that enter the market, are chosen over MI, our revenues could be adversely impacted. The loss of business in general or the specific loss of more profitable business could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results.\nIf we are unable to continue to attract and retain the most significant mortgage originators as customers, our ability to achieve our business goals could be negatively impacted.\nThe success of our mortgage insurance business is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain as customers the most significant mortgage lenders in the U.S., measured through the combined volume of their retail originations and/or the insured loans they may acquire from other originators. As a result of their size and market share, these entities originate a significant majority of high-LTV mortgages in the U.S. and, therefore, influence the size and pricing of the MI market. We are currently doing business with a majority of these lenders. However, there is no assurance we will receive approvals from each of the remaining lenders to transact MI business with them or that those lenders who have approved us will continue to maintain our business relationship. If we are unable to maintain our approved status with one or more of these mortgage lenders, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted.\nWe cannot be certain that any loss of business from one or more customers would be replaced from other new or existing lender customers. Some lenders may decide to write business only with certain mortgage insurers based on their views with respect to an insurer's pricing, price delivery system, service levels, underwriting guidelines, servicing and loss mitigation practices, financial strength or other factors. Our customers may choose to diversify the mortgage insurers with which they do business, which could negatively affect our level of NIW and our market share. In addition, our Master Policies do not require our customers to do business with us. Loss of business from significant customers, if not offset by additional business from other customers, could have an adverse effect on the amount of new business we are able to write, and consequently, our financial condition and operating results.\nIf the volume of high-LTV loan originations declines, our NIW volume could decline, which would reduce our revenues.\nOur NIW volume and revenues, in part, depend on the volume of high-LTV loan originations and may be negatively affected if the volume declines. The factors that affect the volume of high-LTV loan originations include, among other things:\n\u2022the level of loan interest rates. Higher interest rates may increase the potential housing costs of consumers hoping to purchase homes, which may have the effect of reducing the pool of potential borrowers available to purchase homes;\n\u2022restrictions on mortgage credit due to more stringent underwriting standards, more restrictive regulatory and capital requirements and lender liquidity issues;\n\u2022the health of the real estate industry and the national economy and conditions in regional and local economies, which continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures;\n\u2022housing affordability;\n\u2022housing supply;\n\u2022population trends, including the rate of household formation, preferences of potential mortgage borrowers and cultural shifts;\n\u2022the rate of home price appreciation, which in times of heavy refinancing can affect whether refinance loans have LTVs that require MI;\n\u2022deductibility of mortgage interest or other changes in tax policy, including the TCJA of 2017, which may have an effect on the residential housing market;\n\u2022U.S. government housing policy encouraging loans to first-time homebuyers;\n\u2022GSEs' demand to participate in the high-LTV or first-time homebuyer origination market; and\n\u2022the extent to which the GSEs' guaranty and other fees, credit underwriting guidelines and other business terms affect lenders' willingness to extend credit for high-LTV mortgages.\nA decline in the volume of high-LTV loan originations could decrease demand for MI, decrease our NIW and therefore reduce our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur underwriting and credit risk management policies and practices may not anticipate all risks and/or the magnitude of potential for loss as the result of unforeseen risks.\nWe have established underwriting and credit risk management policies and practices that seek to mitigate our exposure to borrower default risk in our insured loan portfolio by anticipating future risks and the magnitude of those risks. Our underwriting and credit risk management guidelines are based on what we believe to be the major factors that influence the performance of mortgage credit, including borrower and loan-level risk characteristics, lender origination practices and macroeconomic variables that influence the housing market. The presence of multiple higher-risk characteristics (i.e., layered risk) in a loan materially increases the likelihood of a default on such a loan unless, and to the extent, there are other characteristics to mitigate the risk.\nThe frequency and severity of claims we incur is uncertain and depends largely on general economic conditions, including unemployment and interest rates and trends in home prices, which continue to be impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures. To the extent that a risk is unforeseen or is underestimated in terms of frequency and/or severity of loss, our underwriting and credit risk management policies and practices may not be sufficient to mitigate the effects of those risks. If these policies and practices do not correctly anticipate risk or the potential for loss, we may underwrite business for which we have not charged premium commensurate with the risk, which could result in material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nUnexpected material increases in borrower defaults could cause our actual losses to materially exceed our expected loss rates, including in certain geographic regions in which our business may be concentrated and more susceptible to downturns.\nLosses result from events that reduce a borrower's ability or willingness to continue to make mortgage payments, which include borrower-specific factors, such as job loss, illness, death, divorce, existing federal supported forbearance programs, and macroeconomic factors, such as rising unemployment, market deterioration, rising interest rates and home price depreciation. Borrowers of high-LTV mortgages often have more difficulty weathering personal financial hardships caused by unforeseen events, because they may not have sufficient personal savings or available credit to structure viable workout solutions. Rising unemployment rates and deterioration in economic conditions for extended periods of time, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, across the U.S. or in specific regional economies, generally increases the likelihood of borrower defaults. An increase in interest rates typically leads to higher monthly payments for borrowers with existing adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and could materially impact the cost and availability of refinance options for borrowers. A decline in home values typically makes it more difficult for borrowers to sell or refinance their homes, generally increasing the likelihood of a default followed by a claim when borrowers are impacted by events that reduce their incomes or increase their expenses. In addition, home price depreciation may also decrease the willingness of borrowers with sufficient resources to make mortgage payments when their mortgage balances exceed the values of their homes. Declines in home values typically increase the severity of any claims we may pay. Home values may decline even absent deterioration in economic conditions due to declines in demand for homes, which may result from changes in buyers' perceptions of the potential for future home price appreciation, rising interest rates or availability of mortgage credit. The ending of widely embraced forbearance programs such as those provided under the CARES Act may also increase the realization of losses related to borrower defaults. If our default and loss projections are materially inaccurate, our actual losses could materially exceed our expectations and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, while we seek to diversify our insured loan portfolio geographically, the availability of business might lead to concentrations in specific regions in the U.S., which could make our business more susceptible to economic downturns in these regions. Certain regions of the U.S. from time to time will experience weaker economic conditions, higher unemployment, lower property values or weaker housing markets. Consequently, loans in these regions will experience higher rates of default, foreclosure and loss than on loans nationally, and struggling borrowers in regions with an oversupply of homes may be unable to sell their homes as a means to avoid foreclosure. Any deterioration in housing prices, housing markets or economic conditions in regions in which we have a significant concentration of IIF and which adversely affects the ability of borrowers to make payments on their insured loans may increase the likelihood and severity of our losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nThe premiums we charge may be insufficient to cover claim payments and our operating costs.\nOur mortgage insurance premiums may not be adequate to cover future claim payments. We set premiums at the time a policy is issued based on our expectations regarding likely performance over the term of the policy. Our premium rates are developed based on expectations that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Our premiums are subject to approval by certain state insurance regulators, which can delay or limit our ability to increase our premiums. Generally, we will not be able to cancel the MI coverage or adjust renewal premiums during the life of an MI policy to mitigate adverse development. As a result, higher than anticipated claims generally will not be able to be offset by premium increases on policies in force or mitigated by our non-renewal or cancellation of insurance coverage. While we believe our capital, premiums and investment earnings will provide a pool of resources sufficient to cover expected loss payments and have made estimates regarding loss payments and potential claims, the ultimate number and magnitude of claims we experience cannot be predicted with certainty and the actual premiums (along with investment earnings) may not be sufficient to cover losses and/or our operating costs. An increase in the number or size of claims, compared to what we anticipate, could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. We may not be able to achieve the results that we expect, and there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed our total resources.\nChanges in factors that impact the length of time that our policies remain in force may adversely affect our future revenues and claims experience.\nWe set premiums at the time our policies are issued based on a broad range of variables, including property, loan, borrower, lender and market (e.g., tax reform) factors to target through-the-cycle returns that exceed our cost of capital. The premium from a single premium policy is collected up front and generally earned over the estimated life of the policy. In contrast, premiums from a monthly premium policy are received and earned each month over the life of the policy and generally cannot be adjusted after coverage is placed. Each year, most of our premiums will be from insurance that has been written in prior years. As a result, the length of time insurance remains in force, which is also generally referred to as persistency, is a primary determinant of our future revenues and claims paying resources.\nA lower level of persistency could reduce our future revenues from our monthly-paid premium products, which constituted about 87% of our primary IIF at year-end 2021. Higher than expected persistency rates could negatively impact our future profitability on monthly premium policies if market and economic conditions change significantly from those we expected when we established the premium rates. In addition, a higher than expected persistency rate will decrease the profitability from single premium policies if they will remain in force longer than was estimated when the policies were written.\nThe factors affecting persistency may include, but are not limited by, the following:\n\u2022servicing guidelines and other policies of the GSEs and other mortgage investors determining the timing and rationale for cancelling mortgage insurance;\n\u2022the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage rates on the IIF, which affects the sensitivity of the IIF to refinancings (i.e., lower current interest rates make it more attractive for borrowers to refinance and receive a lower interest rate);\n\u2022amount of equity in a home, as homeowners with more equity in their homes can more readily move to a new residence or refinance their existing mortgage;\n\u2022changes in rates of home price appreciation or depreciation;\n\u2022economic conditions that affect a borrower's decision to pay-off a mortgage earlier than required;\n\u2022lenders' credit policies, which may make it more difficult for borrowers to refinance their loans;\n\u2022efforts of lenders to solicit borrower refinancing; and\n\u2022cancellation of BPMI mandated by the HOPA, with the time-frames for HOPA required cancellations generally accelerating in a lower interest rate environment relative to a higher interest rate environment.\nIn 2021, mortgage interest rates remained near historical lows, primarily as a result of changes in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. We expect low interest rate environments to drive higher levels of refinancings in the mortgage market, including with respect to loans we insure with interest rates that are higher than the current prevailing rates. We could continue to experience significant turnover in our IIF if the current low-rate environment persists over a prolonged period of time, which could negatively impact our future revenues. We are unsure, however, what the ultimate impact on our revenues will be as insured mortgages are refinanced, because the number of policies we write for replacement mortgages may be more or less than the terminated policies associated with the refinanced mortgages and could be written at lower premium rates. In addition, the GSEs and other mortgage investors who hold the mortgages on which we write mortgage insurance largely control the decision on whether to maintain mortgage insurance. If the GSEs and other mortgage investors change their view on the timing of cancellation of mortgage insurance due to house price appreciation, policy goals, other risk appetite decisions or otherwise, we could experience increased and unexpected turnover in our IIF, which could negatively impact our future revenues.\nIncreases in inflation may have an impact on our business performance and operations.\nRising inflation may negatively impact our expense base by increasing the costs we have to pay, including for services, contractors and employees. If inflation rises to a level that results in the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) raising the federal funds rate, interest rates will generally rise. Rising interest rates can have an impact on housing affordability for our customer base, possibly resulting in lower NIW volume. In addition, if the Fed decides to raise interest rates, there can be no guarantee the Fed will raise rates at a gradual pace, nor can there be any assurance that markets will not adversely react to rate increases.\nWe are outsourcing the underwriting of our mortgage insurance on certain loans to third-party underwriting service providers (USPs). If these USPs fail to adequately perform their underwriting services or place our coverage on loans we would deem ineligible, we could experience increased claims on loans underwritten by them and our customer relationships could be negatively impacted.\nIf our USPs fail to adequately perform their underwriting services, such as mishandling of customer inquiries or an inability to underwrite a sufficient volume of applications per day, we may lose opportunities to place mortgage insurance coverage on particular loans, our reputation may suffer and customers may choose not to do business with us. In addition, if our USPs place our MI coverage on loans that are ineligible for coverage under our underwriting guidelines, our risk of claims will be increased on those loans or the premiums we charge may be inadequate for the corresponding risk. We do not have the right under our Master Policies to cancel coverage of an ineligible loan as a result of a USP making an incorrect decision. Further, other than being able to terminate our contracts with these USPs, we generally do not have express loan-level monetary contractual remedies against these USPs if we are obligated to pay claims on ineligible loans that they improperly agreed to insure on our behalf. If these USPs fail to perform their services as expected, we could experience increased claims on loans underwritten by them and our customer relationships could be negatively impacted, which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur Master Policies contain restrictions on our ability to rescind coverage for certain material misrepresentations (including fraud) and underwriting defects, and if we were to fail to timely discover any such misrepresentations or underwriting defects, our rights of rescission would be significantly limited, and we could suffer increased losses as a result of paying claims on loans with unacceptable risk characteristics.\nUnder our Master Policies' rescission relief provisions, we agree that we will not rescind coverage of an insured loan for material misrepresentation (including borrower fraud) or underwriting defects if the conditions for such relief are satisfied as specified in the applicable Master Policy. In addition, after a loan has achieved rescission relief, we have agreed to limitations on our ability to initiate certain investigations of fraud or misrepresentation by parties involved in the origination of an insured loan. Our earliest rescission relief on an insured loan is subject to our successful completion of an independent validation on such loan. The current processes we have in place to validate insured loans may be ineffective in detecting material misrepresentations and/or underwriting defects. After a loan meets the conditions for rescission relief, we are contractually prohibited from exercising our rights of rescission for material underwriting defects and certain misrepresentations (including borrower fraud) made in connection with the origination of the insured loan and placement of our mortgage insurance. In addition, following a loan's attainment of rescission relief, our rights to conduct investigations of potential fraud or misrepresentation are significantly curtailed and the evidentiary standards we must meet to pursue rescission for fraud are more stringent. See Item 1, \"Business - Underwriting - Independent Validation and Rescission Relief.\" With these provisions in our Master Policies, we may be obligated to pay claims on certain loans with unacceptable risk characteristics or which failed to meet our underwriting guidelines at the time of origination. As a result, we could suffer unexpected losses, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe mix of business we write affects our revenue stream and the likelihood of losses occurring.\nEven when housing values are stable or rising, mortgages with certain characteristics have higher probabilities of claims. These characteristics include loans with LTVs over 95% (or in certain markets that have experienced declining housing values, over 90%), lower credit scores, with lower scores tending to have higher probabilities of claims, or higher total DTI ratios (i.e., DTIs greater than 45%). Loans with high LTVs leave the borrower with little, no or negative equity in the related property, which may result in increased defaults by such borrowers. In addition, depreciation in the values of properties underpinning our insured loans may increase the likelihood of default, and consequently the frequency or severity of losses. Loans with combinations of these risk factors have a higher degree of layered risk. In general, we charge higher premiums for loans with higher risk characteristics; however, there is no guarantee that our premiums will compensate us for any losses we incur on such loans. From time to time, in response to market conditions, we may change the types of loans that we insure and the guidelines under which we insure them, and in doing so, the concentration of insured loans with higher risk characteristics in our portfolio may increase. In addition, we may make programmatic or loan-by-loan exceptions to our underwriting guidelines, including for certain customer programs. We could incur greater than expected claims incidence and claim severity on insured loans that fall outside of our guidelines, which could negatively impact our revenues and operating results.\nWe expect our claims to increase as our insured loan portfolio grows and matures.\nThe actual claims we incur as our portfolio matures are difficult to predict and depend on the specific characteristics of our current in-force book (including the credit score and DTI of the borrower, the LTV ratio of the mortgage and geographic concentrations, among others), as well as the risk profile of new business we write in the future. In addition, our claims experience\nis affected by macroeconomic factors such as housing prices, interest rates, unemployment rates and other events, such as natural disasters or global pandemics (including COVID-19), and any federal, state or local governmental response thereto. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Insurance Claims and Claim Expenses.\" Incurred losses and claims may exceed our expectations in the event of general economic weakness or decreases in housing values. An increase in the number or size of claims, compared to what we anticipate, could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business depends, in part, on effective and reliable loan servicing.\nWe depend on reliable, consistent third-party servicing of the loans that we insure. Among other things, our Master Policies require our insureds and their servicers to timely submit premium and IIF and default reports, use commercially reasonable efforts to limit and mitigate loss when a loan is in default and if loss mitigation efforts are unsuccessful, to pursue foreclosure of the underlying property in accordance with required timelines and practices, which are generally set by the GSEs. Servicers are required to comply with a multitude of legal, regulatory and GSE requirements, procedures and standards for servicing residential mortgage loans. If servicers of our insured loans fail to adhere to applicable requirements, procedures and standards, our losses may unexpectedly increase.\nWe have delegated the authority to implement certain loss mitigation options on loans we insure (e.g., modifications, short sales and deeds-in-lieu) to the GSEs, who have in turn delegated such authority to most of their approved servicers, pursuant to the delegation agreements. Servicers who service GSE-owned loans are required to operate under the GSEs' required standards in accepting certain loss mitigation alternatives. We are dependent on these servicers to appropriately make these decisions under their delegated authority to mitigate our exposure to loss. In some cases, loss mitigation decisions favorable to the GSEs may not be favorable to us and may increase the incidence of paid claims. Inappropriate delegation procedures or failure of servicers to adhere to required standards may increase the magnitude of our losses and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our delegation of loss management decisions to the GSEs is subject to cancellation; however, exercise of these rights may have an adverse effect on our relationship with the GSEs and servicers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has placed additional burdens on servicers, which may make it more difficult for such servicers to effectively service the loans we insure. Servicers of our insured loans could experience liquidity impacts, which may affect their willingness and/or ability to continue to pay premiums to us. Although our master policies do not require payment of premiums after a loan has gone into default, most servicers continue to remit premiums to us to avoid a lapse in coverage if the borrower cures the default; however, in the current environment, it remains uncertain whether servicers will continue to do so. In June 2020, the GSEs temporarily amended PMIERs (subsequently amended and restated in each of September 2020, December 2020 and June 2021) that, among other items, to require GSE-approved mortgage insurers, including NMIC, to notify the relevant GSE if one or more servicers are unable to continue to remit premiums on loans in default, and give such GSE the opportunity to pay the premium to keep coverage in force. In 2021, we did not see any notable changes in servicer payment practices, with servicers generally continuing to remit monthly premium payments as scheduled, including those for policies covering loans that are in a forbearance program. However, if the GSEs choose not to remit premiums under the foregoing circumstances, we could experience adverse impacts to our liquidity, which could be material. Furthermore, if one or more servicers were to experience adverse effects to its business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, such servicers could experience delays in meeting their reporting requirements, which could result in our inability to correctly record new loans as they are underwritten and/or properly recognize and establish loss reserves on loans when defaults exist or occur but are not reported timely or at all. Significant failures by large servicers or disruptions in the servicing of mortgage loans we insure would adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf the estimates we use in establishing claims reserves are incorrect, the actual claim payments we make may materially exceed the amount of our corresponding claims reserves, resulting in unexpected charges to income, which could be material and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe establish reserves for claims and claim expenses for insured mortgage loans that are in default. A loan is considered to be in default as of the payment date at which a borrower has missed the preceding two or more consecutive monthly payments. We establish reserves for loans that have been reported to us in default by servicers, referred to as case reserves, and additional loans that we estimate (based on actuarial review and other factors) to be in default that have not yet been reported to us by servicers, referred to as \"IBNR.\" We also establish reserves for claim expenses, which represent the estimated cost of the claim administration process, including legal and other fees and other general expenses of administering the claim settlement process.\nReserves are established by estimating the number of loans in default that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as claim frequency, and the amount of the claim payment expected to be paid on each such loan in default, which is\nreferred to as claim severity. Claim frequency and severity estimates are established based on historical observed experience regarding certain loan factors, such as age of the default, cure rates, size of the loan and estimated change in property value.\nThe establishment of claims and IBNR reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management. Our estimates of claim frequency and severity are strongly influenced by prevailing economic conditions, including current rates or trends in unemployment, housing price appreciation and/or interest rates, the availability of forbearance, foreclosure moratorium, modification and other assistance programs available to defaulted borrowers, and our best judgments as to the future values or trends of these macroeconomic factors. These factors are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Further, our expectations regarding future claims may change significantly over time. If prevailing economic conditions deteriorate suddenly and/or unexpectedly, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our estimates of loss reserves could be materially understated. Due to the inherent uncertainty and significant judgment involved in the numerous assumptions required to estimate our losses, our loss estimates may vary widely. Because claims and IBNR reserves are based on such estimates and judgments, there can be no assurance that even in a stable economic environment, actual claims paid by us will not be substantially different than the reserves we established for such claims. Our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely impacted if, and to the extent, our actual losses are greater than our claims and IBNR reserves.\nFurther, consistent with industry practice, our reserving method does not take account of losses that could occur from insured loans that are not in default. Thus, future potential losses that may develop from loans not currently in default are not reflected in our financial statements, except in the case where we are required to establish a premium deficiency reserve. As a result, future losses on loans that are not currently in default may have a material impact on future results if, and when, such losses emerge.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to materially adversely impact our financial results and may also materially adversely affect our business, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe continue to closely monitor developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its impact on our business. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. federal government and certain U.S. states adopted measures to contain the virus, including travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, mask mandates, social-distancing measures and business shut-downs. The COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures have had, and are expected to continue to have, a substantial negative impact on many sectors of the U.S. economy and on the financial, capital and credit markets.\nSince the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a number of governmental and GSE efforts to implement programs designed to assist individuals and businesses impacted by COVID-19. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. Congress enacted the CARES Act, and on December 21, 2020, the U.S. Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (2021 Appropriations Act), which was signed into law on December 27, 2020. In March 2021, the Biden administration enacted the American Rescue Plan Act (the American Rescue Plan), which injected $1.9 trillion in financial relief and economic stimulus into the economy. The CARES Act, the 2021 Appropriations Act and the American Rescue Plan provide financial assistance for businesses and individuals, and targeted regulatory relief for financial institutions. Among many other things, the CARES Act suspended foreclosures and evictions for at least 60 days from March 18, 2020, on mortgages purchased or securitized by the GSEs, which moratorium has been extended by the GSEs through September 30, 2021. In addition, the CARES Act enacts into law a requirement to provide payment forbearance for up to 18 months on mortgages to borrowers experiencing hardship during the COVID-19 emergency. Consistent with the CARES Act, the GSEs permit payment forbearance for borrowers facing financial hardship from COVID-19 for a cumulative twelve-month term, and for certain borrowers, if their hardships have not been resolved at the end of their twelve-month terms, they may extend their forbearance terms for up to six additional months.\nThe GSEs, the primary purchasers of mortgages we insure, have also adopted certain measures to assist borrowers impacted by COVID-19. Consistent with the CARES Act, the GSEs have provided a forbearance plan to any borrower who requests a forbearance with an attestation of the financial hardship, directly or indirectly caused by the COVID-19 emergency; and no additional documentation other than the borrower's attestation to a financial hardship caused by the COVID-19 emergency is required. Borrowers that avail themselves of forbearance relief would not incur interest or late fees on deferred amounts. In addition, the GSEs have announced that, at the end of a forbearance plan, the affected borrower will not be required to pay back their reduced or suspended mortgage payments in one lump sum, but may be eligible for a number of different options offered by their mortgage servicer depending on their financial situation, including:\n\u2022if the borrower is unable to repay their deferred payments all at once and can afford to pay a higher monthly mortgage payment for a period of time, the borrower may be eligible for a repayment plan that allows them to repay past due amounts over a period of time;\n\u2022if the borrower can afford to resume their monthly mortgage payment, they may be eligible for a payment deferral in which missed mortgage payments are due at the sale or refinancing of the home or are moved to the end of the maturity of the loan; and\n\u2022if the borrower has a sustained reduction in income and is unable to afford their regular monthly mortgage payment, they may be eligible for a loan modification that changes the terms of the mortgage loan to enable an affordable payment, including through a change to the maturity and amortization schedule of the mortgage loan.\nNotwithstanding the GSEs' efforts and other programs, there can be no assurance that borrowers will be able to remain current on their mortgages after a forbearance period ends, and a significant percentage could remain in default and result in mortgage insurance claims.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and create significant uncertainty about the impacts it will have on the markets in which we operate and on our business, but the impacts are material and adversely affecting our financial results and may adversely impact our business, operations and financial condition. We are currently unable to estimate precisely the magnitude of the impact that the pandemic will ultimately have on our business, operations and financial condition. There have been and we believe there may continue to be a range of adverse effects on our markets, customers, new business, revenues, loss development and related impacts to our capital needs, employee health and productivity, investment portfolio performance, and ability to access capital and reinsurance markets in the future (if we need to). In turn, these impacts may cause changes, which also cannot be precisely determined at this time, to our estimates of future earnings and other guidance we have provided to the markets. In particular, we believe we will experience the following impacts, among others:\n\u2022Containment measures implemented to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic could adversely impact our ability to continue to conduct our business. Although we have been able to continue operations under our business continuity program, the continuing spread and rise of new variants could negatively impact a significant number of our employees and the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities. The continuing spread and rise of new variants could also negatively impact the business and operations of our customers and critical third-party service providers. Further, significant market volatility may leave us unable to react to market events in a manner consistent with our historical practices in dealing with more orderly markets.\n\u2022Mortgage delinquencies are typically affected by a variety of factors, including illness, death, unemployment and other life events, among others, many of which are likely exacerbated by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. While there are continuing efforts underway and vaccines have been introduced to combat the spread and severity of COVID-19 and the related economic impacts, these measures may be ineffective in mitigating the spike in defaults we have received and may continue to receive as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear how many borrowers will obtain forbearance plans, the length of assistance borrowers will require, and whether borrowers will be able to resume their mortgage payments thereafter. Higher unemployment rate could result in higher number of defaults we receive in the near term. In addition, as a result of COVID-19-related relief programs, the defaults related to the COVID-19 pandemic, if not cured, could remain in our default inventory for a protracted period of time, potentially resulting in higher levels of claim severity for those loans that ultimately result in claims. There may be additional, extended or extensive forbearance programs or other changes in regulations or laws which may adversely impact us.\n\u2022We include a loan in our default population and establish loss reserves on such loan when we have received notice from the servicer that as of a particular payment date, the borrower has missed the preceding two or more consecutive monthly payments. In addition, PMIERs generally requires us to treat such loans as non-performing, which then increases the capital we are required to hold against such loans. Under PMIERs, non-performing loans that have missed two or more payments are generally assessed a significantly higher capital charge than performing loans. As set forth in the COVID Guidance, the GSEs temporarily amended PMIERs to reduce the risk-based required asset amount factor under PMIERS for certain COVID-19 loans that default during the COVID-19 Crisis Period for the duration of their forbearance periods and any subsequent repayment plans or trial modification periods. As a result of costs incurred in connection with rising defaults associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact to our capital needs and incurred losses could be material and adversely impact our NIW opportunity and our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022Whether delinquencies ultimately result in claims will depend on a variety of factors, including the length of the crisis and ultimate success of forbearance, government stimulus and other initiatives established to assist homeowners with curing their delinquencies. Due to the inherent uncertainty and significant judgment involved in our assumptions when we establish loss estimates for loans in default, they may turn out to be materially inaccurate and we can provide no assurance that actual claims paid by us, if any, with respect to defaults arising from the pandemic will not be substantially more than the reserves we establish for such defaults.\n\u2022Our Master Policies require insureds to file a claim no later than 60-days after completion of a foreclosure, and in connection with the claim, the insured is generally entitled to include in the claim amount (i) interest (capped at three years) and (ii) certain advances, each as incurred through the date the claim is filed. Under our Master Policies,\na national foreclosure moratorium does not limit the amount of accrued interest (subject to the three-year limit) or advances that may be included in the claim amount. Since the foreclosure moratorium mandated by the GSEs covered an extended period of time, loans in our default inventory, including those with defaults unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic that had not yet gone through foreclosure, may remain in a pre-foreclosure default status for a prolonged period of time, which would delay our receipt of certain claims for loans that do not cure and could increase the severity of claims we may ultimately be required to pay after the moratorium is lifted.\n\u2022Home values could materially decline as a result of a persistent economic downturn arising from the COVID-19 pandemic or the containment or mitigation efforts related thereto. Depreciation in the values of properties underpinning our insured loans may increase the likelihood of default and negatively impact borrowers' abilities to sell their properties for amounts sufficient to cover their unpaid principal. In turn, the frequency or severity of losses we may incur would be negatively impacted.\n\u2022Servicers of our insured loans could experience liquidity impacts, which may affect their willingness and/or ability to continue to pay premiums to us. Although our Master Policies do not require payment of premiums after a loan has gone into default, most servicers continue to remit premiums to us to avoid a lapse in coverage if the borrower cures the default. As set forth in the COVID Guidance, during the COVID-19 Crisis Period, if one or more servicers are unable to continue to remit premiums on loans in default, we, and other approved insurers, have agreed to notify the relevant GSE and give such GSE the opportunity to pay the premium to keep the coverage in force. Notwithstanding our agreement with the GSEs, if there are wide-spread servicer liquidity issues and the GSEs choose not to remit premiums, we could experience adverse impacts to our liquidity, which could be material.\n\u2022Our investment portfolio (and, specifically, the valuations of investment assets we hold) has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected as a result of market deterioration caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty regarding its outcome.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic initially caused significant volatility and disruption to the financial, capital and reinsurance markets and such volatility may return, making access to such markets difficult. To the extent that our current sources of income and capitalization are insufficient to meet GSE and state capital requirements (respectively, as defined therein) or to fund our future operations, we would need to raise additional funds through future financing activities, including through the issuance of additional debt, equity, or a combination of both, reduce our RIF, including through additional reinsurance, or curtail our growth and reduce our expenses. We can give no assurance that any such efforts to raise capital, obtain additional reinsurance or otherwise reduce our RIF would be successful. If we cannot obtain adequate capital, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nGiven the continuing spread of COVID-19 and the rise of new variants, the aforementioned impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures may continue and may worsen to affect households and businesses, or cause continuing or additional limitations on commercial activity, increased unemployment, and general economic and financial instability or volatility. The ultimate significance of COVID-19 on our business will depend on, among other things: the extent and duration of, and severity of illness caused by, the pandemic; the effectiveness of anti-viral and other medical treatments; the effectiveness and availability of vaccines and the willingness of people to be vaccinated; the effects on the economy and the time it takes to stabilize; the extent and duration of current and future containment measures implemented by governmental authorities; current and future governmental assistance programs; and the long-term impact on the mortgage origination and mortgage insurance markets. While at this time we cannot estimate the short or long-term impacts of COVID-19 on our business, the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or pandemics other than COVID-19 could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including pandemics other than COVID-19, earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes and other events that could be related to and could be worsened by changing climatic conditions. We are also exposed to various risks arising out of man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, and military actions. For example, a natural disaster event that could be triggered by climate change, or otherwise, could lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates as policyholders and borrowers who are affected by the disaster may be unable to meet their contractual obligations, such as payment of premiums on our insurance policies and mortgage payments on loans we insure. The continued threat of terrorism may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster or a pandemic could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in new business and increased claims from those areas, and adverse effects on home prices in those areas, which could result in unexpected loss experience in our business. These events also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations. In\naddition, the value of the assets in our investment portfolio could be adversely affected if such an event affects companies' ability to pay us principal or interest on their securities.\nWe insure mortgages for homes in areas that have been impacted by natural disasters, including from hurricanes and wildfires. Following such natural disasters, we and other MIs typically experience an increase in defaults on insured mortgages secured by homes in the impacted areas that negatively impact our incurred losses. Our ultimate claims exposure when we experience these events depends on the number of loans in default, proximate cause of each default and cure rate of the default population. Cure rates on loan defaults following natural disasters are influenced by the adequacy of homeowners and other hazard insurance carried on a related property, GSE-sponsored forbearance and other assistance programs, and a borrower's access to aid from government entities and private organizations, in addition to other factors which generally impact cure rates in unaffected areas. We have observed that loans in default in disaster zones typically cure at a higher rate than non-disaster related loans in default. As such, we historically have established lower reserves for these type of defaults than we otherwise do for similarly situated loans in default in non-disaster zones. Due to the inherent uncertainty and significant judgment involved in our assumptions, our loss estimates may turn out to be materially inaccurate and we can provide no assurance that actual claims paid by us, if any, on defaulted loans in disaster zones will not be substantially different than the reserves we establish for such claims.\nWe are exposed to certain risks associated with our third-party reinsurance transactions, including the possibility that our reinsurers will fail to perform their obligations or that we will lose the capital credit we expected to receive when we entered into the transactions as a result of future GSE or Wisconsin OCI action or if any of our reinsurers experiences a downgrade or other adverse business event.\nWe use third-party reinsurance, including the QSR Transactions and the ILN Transactions, to actively manage our risk, ensure compliance with PMIERs, state regulatory and other applicable capital requirements and support the growth of our business. There is a risk that these transactions will not continue to provide the benefits we expected when we entered into them, including as a result of our counter-parties under the QSR Transactions (which are not fully collateralized like the ILN Transactions) not performing their obligations, the GSEs or the Wisconsin OCI not continuing to give us full capital credit as anticipated for the duration of the contracts, or if one or more reinsurers under the QSR Transactions experiences a downgrade or other adverse business event. Any of these events could have negative impacts on the credit for the risk transferred under the reinsurance agreements and, in turn, on our capital needs, PMIERs position and growth potential.\nReinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our insureds to pay claims, even when there are reinsurance recoverables available to us under the QSR Transactions. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to such reinsurers. To mitigate this risk, there are certain contractual protections that establish sources from which we may directly obtain our reinsurance recoverables under the QSR Transactions. The ILN Transactions are fully collateralized with funds deposited into trust accounts to secure the obligations of the reinsurers to NMIC under the respective reinsurance agreement. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 6, Reinsurance,\" below. To the extent the amounts in the QSR trust accounts are insufficient to cover loss recoveries and other amounts to which we are entitled under the QSR Transactions, we would attempt to recover such amounts directly from the reinsurers. One or more reinsurers may be unable or unwilling to pay reinsurance recoverables owed to us in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf any reinsurer under the QSR Transactions experiences a ratings downgrade, the related reinsurance agreements obligate any such reinsurer, consistent with PMIERs requirements, to increase collateral in the related trust account. If the reinsurer breaches its collateral obligations, and fails to cure after notice, we may terminate the agreement with respect to such reinsurer. The QSR Transactions also give us the right to terminate the agreements in certain other circumstances, including, among other reasons, if a reinsurer becomes insolvent, has its license revoked or reinsures its entire liability under the relevant QSR Transaction with another entity. If we experience an early termination, we would be required to re-assume the risk ceded to the breaching reinsurer and the PMIERs and statutory capital credit we received when we entered into the agreement would be reversed. Depending on the timing and severity, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, growth potential and future capital needs.\nIn addition, the GSEs and the Wisconsin OCI have the right periodically to review performance under our third-party reinsurance transactions, including the reinsurers' financial strength and other factors the GSEs and Wisconsin OCI may believe are important to an evaluation of the transactions, which factors may be unknown to us. As a result of such reviews, the GSEs or the Wisconsin OCI could withdraw their approvals or continue their approvals, but grant less than full capital credit. If we do not continue to receive full capital credit in connection with these transactions, we would likely need to seek other sources of capital or reductions in RIF sooner than we would have expected with full capital credit under PMIERs and state insurance laws. Future sources of capital will depend on the cost, availability and terms and conditions that are acceptable to us, our regulators and the\nGSEs. We cannot be sure that we will be able to secure other sources of capital or substitute reductions in RIF in the amounts we require and on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur operating results depend in large part on our ability to manage the risks related to the growth of our business and on maintaining and enhancing effective operating procedures and internal controls.\nWe have experienced significant growth since we started our mortgage insurance business in 2013. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully manage the continued growth of our business and the demands such growth places on our operations personnel and senior management team. The unexpected loss of key management and other personnel, or the inability to recruit, develop and retain qualified management talent in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. If we are unable to manage future expansion in our operations, we may experience compliance and operational problems, be required to slow the pace of growth, or have to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth, any one of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur future operating results also depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve our operational, credit, financial, management and other disclosure and internal risk controls and procedures and our reporting systems and procedures. Our management does not expect that our disclosure and internal risk controls and procedures will prevent all potential errors and fraud. We may not successfully implement improvements to, or integrate, our controls and procedures in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing controls and procedures. There can be no guarantee that we will not experience flaws in our internal controls and procedures in the future.\nThe design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. If our controls are not effective or not properly implemented, we could suffer financial or other loss, disruption of our business, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. Losses resulting from these failures can vary significantly in size, scope and scale and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to operational risk from fraud, malfeasance or error by employees and third-party service providers, and any such fraud, malfeasance or error could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud or malfeasance by employees and outsiders, including third-party service providers, clerical record-keeping errors and transactional errors. Our business depends on our employees and third parties to process a large number of transactions. We could be materially and adversely affected if one of our employees or one of our systems causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. Third parties with which we do business also could be sources of operational risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of such parties' own systems or employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we activated our business continuity program and instituted work-from-home practices for our Emeryville-based employees and staff. As a result of the remote work arrangement adopted, and that have continued either on a hybrid or permanent basis, the effectiveness of our compliance programs and overall ability to prevent and detect fraud or malfeasance by our employees or contractors may be diminished. Any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability to operate our business, potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results.\nIf we do not maintain connectivity with or otherwise meet the technological demands of our customers or are unable to develop, enhance and maintain our proprietary technology platform, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide and distribute our MI products and services. Our customers require us to provide and service our MI products in a secure manner, including through our proprietary technology platform, our internet website or direct electronic data transmissions. In furtherance of this, we are party to an agreement with TCS, whereby TCS provides services across business functions, such as application development and support, infrastructure support (service desk, end user computing and engineering services), and information security. Our customers may choose to do business only with mortgage insurers with which they are already technologically compatible and may choose to retain existing MI providers rather than invest the time and resources to integrate with a new MI provider. Our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely impacted if we do not successfully establish and maintain these arrangements and relationships, or otherwise keep pace with the technological demands of customers.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to timely and effectively resolve any significant issues that may arise with the operation of our technology platform. While we anticipate that our engagement with TCS will enhance our ability to\nfurther develop, deploy, and service our technology platform, any delays caused by the outsourcing of these functions, deterioration in our relationship with TCS, or termination of our engagement with TCS could lead to significant disruptions in our operations. If our technology platform fails to perform in the manner we expect, our business, financial condition and operating results may be significantly harmed. Further, our business would be negatively impacted if we are unable to enhance our platform when necessary to support our primary business functions, including to match or exceed the technological capabilities of our competitors over time. We cannot predict with certainty the cost of maintaining and improving our platform, but failure to make necessary improvements and any significant shortfall in any technology enhancements or negative variance in the timeline in which system enhancements are delivered could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or misuse of confidential, personal or proprietary information.\nOur IT systems process, transmit, store and protect large amounts of personal information of borrowers whose mortgages we insure, in addition to the confidential, proprietary, financial and other information that are critical to our business. Our IT systems and networks, including those functions that we may outsource, are vulnerable to unauthorized access, interruptions or failures due to events that are often beyond our control, including cyber-attacks, natural disasters, theft, terrorist attacks and general technology failures. We may, from time to time, upgrade certain of our information systems, and transform and automate certain of our business processes. We also have outsourced certain technology and business functions to third parties, and may continue to do so in the future. If we fail to timely and successfully implement and integrate new technology systems or if the systems and/or transformed and automated business processes do not operate as expected, this may expose us to increased risk related to data and information security and unexpected service disruptions, which could result in monetary and reputational damage or harm to our competitive position. Remote working arrangements adopted, and that have continued either on a permanent or hybrid basis, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may also increase the risk of cyber-security attacks or data security incidents. In particular, in a remote environment, our employees and vendors rely on the use of portable computers and mobile devices, which can be stolen, lost or misused, making information accessible through such devices more vulnerable to unauthorized access, including by employee malfeasance. We have adopted information security procedures and controls to safeguard our systems and the information that we process, transmit and store, including new multi-factor authentication. Despite these efforts, we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, or detect and contain a breach in a timely manner, including because employees may not follow the controls we have implemented, the invasive techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources and methods. The continuing COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these risks. Our employees, customers or other users of our systems are from time-to-time subject to fraudulent inducements by parties attempting to gain access to our data or that of our customers. Although we believe that we have appropriate information security policies and systems in place, there is no assurance that our information security policies and systems in place can prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including nonpublic personal information. Any compromise of the security of our IT systems may result in loss of personally identifiable information, financial losses, loss of customers and the inability to transact business; could be costly and time-consuming to address and resolve; could expose us to liability for damages, harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and/or expose us to civil litigation. If any of these were to occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Further, the technology errors and omissions insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate or unavailable to cover claims and/or costs associated with incidents that may occur in the future.\nAdverse investment performance may affect our financial results and ability to conduct business.\nIncome from our investment portfolio provides a growing source of revenue and cash flow to support our operations and claim payments. If we improperly structure our investments to meet those future liabilities or have unexpected losses in our portfolio, including losses resulting from impairments or the forced liquidation of investments before their maturity, we may be unable to meet those obligations. NMIC's investments and investment policies are subject to state insurance laws, which results in our portfolio being predominantly limited to highly rated fixed income securities. Our investment portfolio has been established at a time of historically low interest rates. If interest rates rise above the rates on our fixed income securities, the market value of our investment portfolio would decrease. Any significant decrease in the value of our investment portfolio would adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe may be required or find it advisable to change our investments or investment policies depending upon regulatory, economic, social and market conditions, or our existing or anticipated financial condition and operating requirements, including the tax position, of our business. Our investment objectives may not be achieved. The success of our investment activity is affected by general economic conditions, which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest-rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and, consequently, the value of fixed income securities. In addition, our investment portfolio (and, specifically, the valuations of investment assets we hold) has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected as a result of market deterioration caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty regarding its outcome.\nWe face regulatory and litigation risks associated with offering loan review services.\nNMIS offers loan review services for certain of our customers that are performed by SAFE Act-licensed third-party service providers, including on loans for which NMIC is not providing mortgage insurance. Under the terms of our service agreements and subject to such agreements' contractual limitations on liability, we provide limited indemnity rights for \"material errors,\" if such errors materially impair the saleability of a reviewed loan, results in a material reduction in the value of such loan or results in the customer being required to repurchase such loan. The indemnification may be in the form of monetary or other remedies, subject to per loan and annual limitations. Accordingly, we have assumed some credit risk in connection with providing these services. NMIS contracts with SAFE Act-licensed third-party service providers to provide loan review services, and we believe we have structured NMIS' operations so that it does not itself engage in any activities that would trigger licensure under the SAFE Act. However, the CFPB or other regulators could take a different position, thereby increasing the risk of regulatory scrutiny and potential enforcement action and/or litigation involving these loan review services. Any such scrutiny, enforcement action or litigation could result in a diminished ability to operate our business, potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could in turn result in a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results. See \"The private MI industry is, and as a participant we are, subject to litigation and regulatory enforcement risk generally,\" below.\nRisks Related to Regulation of the Mortgage Insurance Industry\nThere can be no assurance that the GSEs will continue to treat us as an approved insurer in the future, and our failure to maintain compliance with the GSEs' PMIERs could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nNMIC is a GSE approved insurer, and the significant majority of insurance we write is on loans sold to the GSEs. The GSEs set their own counter-party standards for private mortgage insurers, known as PMIERs. (Italicized terms have the same meaning that such terms have in the PMIERs.) As a result, our compliance with the PMIERs is necessary to maintain NMIC's status as an approved insurer. The PMIERs establish operational, business, remedial and financial requirements applicable to approved insurers. By April 15th of each year, NMIC must certify it met all PMIERs requirements as of December 31st of the prior year. NMIC also has an ongoing obligation to immediately notify the GSEs in writing upon discovery of its failure to meet one or more of the PMIERs requirements, some of which do not have materiality thresholds. We certified to the GSEs by April 15, 2021 that NMIC was in full compliance with the PMIERs as of December 31, 2020.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that NMIC will continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements. If NMIC were to experience a material reduction to revenues or an unexpected, significant increase in losses, NMIC's available assets could fall below the minimum required assets mandated by the PMIERs financial requirements. In addition, as NMIC continues to grow its business and increase its net RIF, NMIC may need to raise additional capital or reduce its net RIF, including through the use of additional reinsurance, to remain in compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements and to continue to support new business writings. Any future growth capital may be in the form of debt, equity, or a combination of both. We can give no assurance that our efforts to raise capital, obtain additional reinsurance or otherwise reduce our RIF would be successful.\nThe PMIERs provide that the table of factors that determine minimum required assets will be updated every two years or more frequently to reflect macroeconomic conditions, loan performance or to address other issues the GSEs deem important. In addition, the GSEs may amend or clarify other aspects of the PMIERs at any time. For example, in 2021, the GSEs finalized the 2021 PMIERs Guidance, which, among other things: (i) temporarily amended PMIERs to recognize the COVID-19 pandemic as a nationwide major disaster and to reduce the risk-based required asset amount factor under PMIERS for certain COVID-19 defaulted loans (the COVID Guidance) and (ii) permanently amended PMIERs to clarify delinquency reporting requirements for non-performing loans under PMIERs. There is no assurance NMIC will remain in compliance or that the GSEs will not make the PMIERs financial requirements more onerous in the future. If any future updates to the PMIERs would require NMIC to materially increase the amount of available assets to support its business writings, the amount of capital NMIC is required to hold will increase, which may have a negative effect on our returns. Any such effect could have a negative impact on our flexibility to meet our business plans and our future operating results.\nCompliance with PMIERs requires us to seek the GSEs' prior approval before taking many actions, including implementing new products or services or entering into inter-company agreements among other actions. In addition, for an approved insurer to receive a reduction in its risk-based required asset amount for new or revised reinsurance transactions, the approved insurer must obtain the GSEs' written approval. PMIERs' approval requirements could prohibit, materially modify or delay us in our intended course of action. Further, the GSEs may modify or change their interpretation of terms they require us to include in our mortgage insurance policies for loans purchased by them, requiring us to modify our terms of coverage or operational procedures to remain an approved insurer, and such changes could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operating results. For example, we and other approved insurers were required to implement new master policies to,\namong other things, include terms that conform to the GSEs' RRP. In addition, consistent with the 2021 PMIERs Guidance and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we agreed with the GSEs to implement for a limited period of time certain operational and contractual flexibilities, including providing the GSEs the opportunity to pay premiums to keep coverage in force if one or more servicers are unable to continue to remit premiums on loans in default. It is possible the GSEs could, in their own discretion, require additional limitations and/or conditions on certain of our activities and practices that are not currently in the PMIERs or otherwise required by the GSEs for us to remain an approved insurer. Additional requirements or conditions imposed by the GSEs could further limit our operating flexibility and the areas in which we may write new business.\nIf, in the future, NMIC fails to comply with the PMIERs, including the financial requirements, it may lose its approved insurer status from one or both GSEs, or may have to enter into a remediation plan (with the approval of the GSEs), curtail its business writings or cease transacting new business altogether. Any of these events would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and future business prospects.\nChanges in the business practices of the GSEs, including a decision to decrease or discontinue the use of private MI, federal legislation that changes their charters or a restructuring of the GSEs could reduce our revenues or increase our losses.\nThe requirements and practices of the GSEs impact the operating results and financial performance of approved insurers, including NMIC. Changes in the charters or business practices of Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae could materially reduce the number of mortgages they purchase that are insured by us and consequently diminish our franchise value. The GSEs could be directed to make such changes by the FHFA, which was appointed as their conservator in September 2008 and has the authority to control and direct the operations of the GSEs.\nWith the GSEs in a prolonged conservatorship, there has been ongoing debate over the future role and purpose of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market. The U.S. Congress may legislate, or the administration may implement through administrative reform, structural and other changes to the GSEs and the functioning of the secondary mortgage market. Since 2011, there have been numerous legislative proposals intended to incrementally scale back the GSEs (such as a statutory mandate for the GSEs to transfer mortgage credit risk to the private sector) or to completely reform the housing finance system. Congress, however, has not enacted any legislation to date. The proposals vary with regard to the government's role in the housing market, and more specifically, with regard to the existence of an explicit or implicit government guarantee. Recently, there has been increased focus on and discussion of administrative reform independent of legislative action. In September 2019, the Treasury Department released its Housing Reform Plan that included a compilation of legislative and administrative recommendations for reforms to achieve various goals, and among them, the goals of ending the conservatorships of the GSEs and setting regulations for the GSEs that provide for their safety and soundness. Additionally, the previous Director of the FHFA had also publicly stated as his priority to exit the GSEs from conservatorship. Accordingly, the previous FHFA leadership focused on preparing the GSEs to exit from conservatorship by increasing the GSEs\u2019 overall capital levels and reducing their credit risk profile. On November 18, 2020, the FHFA announced that it had finalized and sent for publication a rule establishing a new regulatory capital framework for the GSEs, which included provisions governing the capital relief allowed to the GSEs for loans with private MI. The final rule established that loans with private MI as opposed to loans without private MI, provide more favorable capital relief to the GSEs. Notwithstanding this beneficial capital treatment for loans with private MI, the total capital required to be held by the GSEs upon implementation of the final rule is significant. An increase in the capital required to be held by us under PMIERs could make our products more expensive and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and future business prospects.\nOn June 23, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the President could remove the FHFA Director other than for cause, Subsequently, President Biden removed the previous FHFA Director and appointed a new Acting Director to lead the FHFA. Unlike the prior FHFA leadership\u2019s primary focus to exit the GSEs from conservatorship, the new Acting Director's actions are more focused on increasing the accessibility and affordability of mortgage credit, especially to low-and-moderate income borrowers and underserved communities. Between the Acting Director of the FHFA and the Treasury Department, they possess significant capacity to effect administrative GSE reforms. In September 2021, the FHFA together with the Treasury Department proposed amendments to the regulatory capital framework that would, among other things, reduce the amount of capital the GSEs are required to hold compared to the final December 2020 rule, including by increasing the capital credit the GSEs receive for the credit risk that they distribute. It is uncertain if and when these proposed amendments may be adopted into the regulatory capital framework and what form that they may take. If any GSE reform is adopted, whether through legislation or administrative action, it could impact the current role of private mortgage insurance as credit enhancement, including its reduction or elimination, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue, operating results, prospects or financial condition. Some other examples of potential GSE reforms or policy changes that could impact our business, may also include, but are not limited by, the following:\n\u2022Policies or requirements that may result in a reduction in the number of mortgages GSEs acquire;\n\u2022The national conforming loan limit for mortgages GSEs acquire;\n\u2022The level of mortgage insurance required;\n\u2022The terms on which mortgage insurance coverage may be canceled prior to reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law;\n\u2022The terms required to be included in master policies for the mortgage insurance policies GSEs acquire;\n\u2022The amount of loan level price adjustments or guarantee fees that the GSEs charge on loans that require mortgage insurance; and\n\u2022The degree of influence that the GSEs have over a mortgage lender\u2019s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage.\nAs a result of these matters, it is uncertain what role private capital, including MI, will play in the domestic residential housing finance system in the future or the impact of any such changes on our business. Any changes to the charters or statutory authorities of the GSEs would require Congressional action to implement. Passage and timing of any comprehensive GSE reform or incremental change (legislative or administrative) is uncertain, making the actual impact on us and our industry difficult to predict. Any such changes that come to pass could have a significant impact on our business.\nIn recent years, the FHFA has set goals for the GSEs to transfer significant portions of the GSEs' mortgage credit risk to the private sector. To date, several credit risk transfer products have been created under the program, including the now discontinued IMAGIN and EPMI and others discussed above in \"Our NIW volumes could be adversely affected if lenders and investors select alternatives to private MI.\" To the extent these credit risk products evolve in a manner that displaces primary MI coverage, the amount of insurance we write may be reduced. It is difficult to predict the impact of alternative credit risk transfer products, if any, that are developed to meet the goals established by the FHFA.\nWe are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and capital adequacy requirements, which we must satisfy to continue to operate our MI business.\nThe U.S. MI industry and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state regulation in each jurisdiction in which they are licensed or authorized to do business. Regulatory scrutiny could lead to new legal precedents, new regulations or new practices, or regulatory actions or investigations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Although their scope varies, state insurance laws generally grant broad supervisory powers to state insurance regulatory authorities to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business, including premium rates, trade and claims practices, accounting methods, marketing practices, policy forms and capital adequacy. These state insurance regulatory authorities could take actions that could materially impact the types of products and services we and our industry are permitted to offer, including requiring us (and other MI companies) to modify current pricing and business practices. Further, failure to comply with the applicable regulations could lead to enforcement or disciplinary action, including the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate.\nNMIC's principal regulator is the Wisconsin OCI. Under applicable Wisconsin law, as well as that of 15 other states, a mortgage insurer must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its RIF for the mortgage insurer to continue to write new business. While formulations of minimum capital may vary in each jurisdiction that has such a requirement, the most common measure applied allows for a maximum permitted RTC ratio of 25:1. Wisconsin and certain other states, including California and Illinois, apply a substantially similar requirement referred to as minimum policyholders' position. If our business grows faster (i.e., our RIF grows faster than expected) or is less profitable than expected (i.e., our revenues do not generate the return we expect), our actual RTC ratios over the short to mid-term could exceed our expected RTC ratios and could begin to approach the limits to which we are subject, which could require us to enter into alternative arrangements to reduce our RIF, including through additional reinsurance or raising additional capital. If this were to occur, we can give no assurance that our efforts to obtain additional reinsurance or otherwise reduce our RIF, or to raise capital would be successful, and if such efforts are unsuccessful, we could exceed state-imposed capital requirements. Accordingly, if we fail to meet the capital adequacy requirements in one or more states, we could be required to suspend writing business in some or all of the states in which we do business.\nThe NAIC has formed the Working Group to discuss and recommend changes to the solvency and market practices regulation of mortgage insurers, including changes to the Model Act. Proposed amendments to the Model Act include, among other changes, the introduction of a risk-based capital model. We, along with other mortgage insurers, have provided feedback to the Working Group since early 2013, including comments on the risk-based capital model. If the risk-based capital model is adopted by the NAIC, some or all of the 16 states that currently have minimum statutory capital requirements, and potentially others that do not, could enact a portion or all of the revised Model Act, including the loan-level capital model. The Working Group's discussions are ongoing and the ultimate outcome of these discussions and any potential actions taken by the NAIC cannot be predicted at this time. If the Working Group's final proposal to the NAIC contains more stringent capital requirements, this could ultimately lead to NMIC being obligated to hold more capital for its insured business than we are required to hold under PMIERs, which would reduce our profitability compared to the profitability we expect under the existing capital requirements.\nThe private MI industry is, and as a participant we are, subject to litigation and regulatory enforcement risk generally.\nWe operate in highly regulated industries that inherently pose a heightened risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings. As a result, the members of the MI industry, including NMIC, face litigation risk, including the risk of class action lawsuits, and administrative enforcement by federal regulators and state insurance agencies in the ordinary course of operations. In addition, the private MI industry, including NMIC, may be affected by changes in the laws and regulations to which we are subject or the way they are interpreted or applied. See \"Item 1 - Business - U.S. Mortgage Insurance Regulation.\"\nIn the past, mortgage insurers (excluding NMIC) have been involved in litigation and regulatory enforcement actions alleging violations of Section 8 of RESPA. Among other things, Section 8 of RESPA generally precludes mortgage insurers from paying referral fees to mortgage lenders for the referral of MI business. This limitation also can prohibit providing services or products to mortgage lenders free of charge, charging fees for services that are lower than their reasonable or fair market value, and paying fees for services that mortgage lenders provide that are higher than their reasonable or fair market value, in exchange for the referral of MI business. Various regulators, including the CFPB, state insurance commissioners and state attorneys general, may bring actions seeking various forms of relief in connection with alleged violations of the referral fee limitations of RESPA, as can private litigants in class actions. In the years following the most recent financial crisis, the CFPB pursued a higher volume of enforcement actions against mortgage industry participants, including mortgage insurers. In particular, the CFPB focused on challenging mortgage insurers' captive reinsurance arrangements under Section 8 of RESPA. The insurance law provisions of many states also prohibit paying for the referral of insurance business and provide various mechanisms to enforce this prohibition. New leadership at the CFPB or any changes made under the current presidential administration may also have an impact on future CFPB enforcement activity. The CFPB's interpretation and enforcement of Section 8 of RESPA presents regulatory risk for many providers of \"settlement services,\" including mortgage insurers.\nWe currently are not a party to any federal or state regulatory enforcement actions; however, such proceedings could arise in the future. The cost to defend, and the ultimate resolution of, any such action or proceeding could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. Should we become a party to an action by any of these regulators, the ultimate outcome is difficult to predict, and it is possible that any outcome could be negative to us specifically or the industry in general and such a negative outcome could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nFrom time-to-time, we have been involved in certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. To date, we have not recognized a material liability related to any of our legal proceedings. However, the outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain, and it is possible that one or more of any such matters in the future could have an unanticipated material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and operating results.\nOur business prospects and operating results could be adversely impacted if, and to the extent that, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's ATR Rules defining a QM negatively impact the size of the origination market.\nIn January 2014, the CFPB implemented the Dodd-Frank Act ATR mortgage provisions (ATR), which govern the obligation of lenders to determine a borrower's ability to pay when originating a mortgage loan covered by ATR. A subset of mortgages falling under the ATR that has certain low-risk characteristics are known as QMs. QMs that are deemed to have the lowest risk profiles are entitled to a safe-harbor presumption of compliance with the ability-to-pay requirements. The original ATR/QM rule (Original QM Definition) established two different categories of QMs, one referred to as the \"General QM\" category and a second, temporary QM category, typically referred to as the \"QM Patch\". In the fourth quarter of 2020, the CFPB released a series of final rules to (i) eliminate the QM Patch, (ii) amend the definition of a General QM, and (iii) provide for a new, Seasoned QM category. The General QM final rule is effective on March 1, 2021 and originally had a mandatory compliance date of July 1, 2021, after which the Original QM Definition and QM Patch would no longer apply. The mandatory compliance date for the New QM Definition (and therefore, the preservation of the Original QM Definition and QM Patch) has since been extended to October 1, 2022. However, the GSEs announced on April 8, 2021 that, for loan applications received on or after July 1, 2021, they will only purchase loans satisfying the New General QM Definition. Given the mandatory compliance date and the GSE announcement, we expect creditors may opt to use the new, price-based General QM definition. See \"Item 1, \"Business - U.S. Mortgage Insurance Regulation - Other U.S. Regulation - Housing Finance Reform\" above for a summary of the GSEs final rules related to QMs. The expiration of the QM Patch or eventual implementation of the General QM and Seasoned QM final rules could affect the residential mortgage market and demand for private mortgage insurance.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also gave statutory authority to the HUD, the VA, and the USDA to develop their own definitions of \"QM,\" which those agencies have completed. To the extent lenders find that the HUD definition of QM is more favorable to certain segments of their borrowers, they may choose FHA products over private MI products.\nWe, along with other industry participants, have observed that the significant majority of covered loans made after the effective date of the ATR rule have been QMs. We expect that most lenders will continue to be reluctant to make loans that do not qualify as QMs because absent full compliance with the ATR rule, such loans will not be entitled to a safe-harbor presumption of compliance with the ability-to-pay requirements. As a result, we believe ATR regulations have given rise to a subset of borrowers who cannot meet the regulatory QM standards, thus restricting their access to mortgage credit and reducing the size of the residential mortgage market. It is unclear whether the expiration of the QM Patch or the revised General QM rule or the new Seasoned QM category will have any impact on access to mortgage credit or the size of the mortgage market. Our business prospects and operating results could be adversely impacted if, and to the extent that, the QM regulations or the CFPB's actions negatively impact the size of the origination market.\nThe Company may be adversely impacted by the phasing out of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).\nWe have exposure to LIBOR-indexed financial instruments, including our credit instruments and ILN Transactions. As of December 31, 2021, we held $33.9 million of floating-rate securities in our investment portfolio that yield interest based on an index rate, predominantly LIBOR, plus a margin (the LIBOR-indexed securities). In addition, we believe most ARMs in our IIF are indexed to LIBOR. In 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling the banks that sustain LIBOR to submit rate quotations after December 31, 2021. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration Ltd. (IBA), the administrator of LIBOR, announced it will consult with constituents on its intention to cease the publication of the one week and two month U.S. dollar LIBOR (USD LIBOR) settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. On March 5, 2021, IBA confirmed its 2020 announcement that it would permanently cease the publication of overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month USD LIBOR settings in their current form after June 30, 2023. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), the regulator of IBA, announced on the same day that it intends to stop requiring panel banks to continue to submit to LIBOR and all USD LIBOR settings in their current form will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative after June 30, 2023. Accordingly, it remains uncertain whether USD LIBOR will continue to be quoted after 2021, or if it does continue to be quoted, whether it will be reliable.\nEfforts to identify and transition to a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference rates have been underway, including proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Fed (ARRC). In 2017, the ARRC recommended an alternative reference rate referred to as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), a combination of certain overnight repo rates, to replace USD LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR in 2018.\nWe continue to analyze potential risks associated with the LIBOR transition, including financial, operational, legal and market risks. We have created an enterprise plan focused on this transition, including identifying and monitoring our exposure to LIBOR and monitoring the market adoption of alternative reference rates and industry-standard contractual fall-back provisions.\nEach of our LIBOR-indexed financial instruments and we believe most of our LIBOR-indexed securities provides for determining an alternative reference rate if LIBOR is discontinued. LIBOR-indexed ARMs typically provide lenders with the option to choose a comparable rate if LIBOR ceases to exist. However, there is considerable uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the discontinuance of LIBOR in these financial instruments. Alternative reference rates that replace LIBOR may not yield the same or similar economic results over the lives of these financial instruments. In addition, while the ARRC was created to ensure a successful transition from LIBOR, there can be no assurance that the ARRC will endorse practices that create a smooth transition and minimize value transfers between market participants, or that its endorsed practices will be broadly adopted by market participants. In addition, we cannot anticipate how long it will take to develop the systems and processes necessary to adopt SOFR or other benchmark replacements, which may delay and contribute to uncertainty and volatility surrounding the LIBOR transition.\nAccordingly, a change or transition away from LIBOR as a common reference rate in the financial market could have a range of adverse effects on our business. In particular any such transition could:\n\u2022adversely affect the interest rates we pay on our LIBOR-indexed financial instruments;\n\u2022cause volatility in the yield of our LIBOR-indexed securities and investment income;\n\u2022prompt additional inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\n\u2022result in disputes, litigation or other actions with our counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fall-back language in LIBOR-based instruments and securities we hold; and\n\u2022disrupt the residential mortgage market, including with respect to ARMs, if replacement indices unilaterally chosen by lenders negatively impact borrowers, which could give rise to higher than expected rates of default on such loans and increased litigation.\nRisks Related to Our Holding Company and Capital Structure\nOur holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations and potentially require us to raise more capital.\nNMIH serves as the holding company for our operating subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. NMIH's principal source of operating cash is investment income, and could in the future include dividends from NMIC and Re One, which currently does not have active insurance exposure. NMIC currently has the capacity to pay aggregate ordinary dividends of $34.9 million to NMIH during the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2021 without prior approval from the Wisconsin OCI. NMIH also has access to $250 million of undrawn revolving credit capacity under the senior secured credit facilities. In addition, NMIH currently receives cash from our insurance subsidiaries, consisting of payments made under our tax and expense-sharing arrangements. Among such agreements, the Wisconsin OCI has approved the allocation of interest expense on our $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes that mature on June 1, 2025 (the Notes) and senior secured credit facilities to NMIC to the extent proceeds from the Notes offering and facility are distributed to NMIC or used to repay, redeem or otherwise defease amounts raised by NMIC under prior credit arrangements that have previously been distributed to NMIC. The expense-sharing arrangements between us and our subsidiaries, as amended, have been approved by the Wisconsin OCI, but such approval may be revoked at any time. NMIH depends on these sources of liquidity to make principal and interest payments under its current debt arrangements and to pay certain corporate expenses and income taxes, among other things. If payments to NMIH were curtailed or limited, there is a risk that NMIH would be unable to satisfy its financial obligations.\nNMIH's dividend income is limited to upstream dividend payments from our subsidiaries. With respect to our insurance subsidiaries, under Wisconsin law, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed \"extraordinary\" and require approval of the Wisconsin OCI. Other states in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed also limit or restrict their ability to pay dividends. It is possible that Wisconsin and other states that have dividend restrictions will adopt revised statutory provisions or interpretations of existing statutory provisions that could be more restrictive than those currently in effect or will otherwise take actions that may further restrict the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or returns of capital. In addition, under the PMIERs, if an approved insurer fails to meet the PMIERs financial requirements, such approved insurer may not pay dividends without the prior written approval of the GSEs.\nIn addition, to support NMIC's future growth, we could be required to provide additional capital support for NMIC if additional capital is required by the GSEs or pursuant to insurance laws and regulations. If we were unable to meet our obligations, NMIC could lose GSE approval and/or be required to cease writing business in one or more states, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nTo the extent that the funds generated from investment income or by our ongoing operations and capitalization are insufficient to fund future operating requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through future financing activities, including through the issuance of additional debt, equity, or a combination of both, reduce our RIF, including through additional reinsurance, or curtail our growth and reduce our expenses. NMIH's future capital requirements depend on many factors, including NMIC's ability to successfully write new business, establish premium rates at levels sufficient to cover claims and operating costs and meet minimum required asset thresholds under the PMIERs. We can give no assurance that our efforts to raise capital, obtain additional reinsurance or otherwise reduce our RIF would be successful. If we cannot obtain adequate capital, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe currently have and will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021 our debt totaled approximately $394.6 million.\nOur indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our business, financial condition and operating results, including:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of the cash flow from our subsidiaries' operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes;\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to retain our existing ratings or to obtain investment-grade credit ratings in the future;\n\u2022making it more difficult to conduct our business successfully or to grow our business, or limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business; and\n\u2022placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.\nIn addition, our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior secured notes contain certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, incur liens, transfer or dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other companies and pay dividends. Our senior secured credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial and other maintenance covenants. A failure to comply with covenants or the other terms of our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior secured notes could result in an event of default under such indebtedness, which, if not remedied, may trigger an event of default under certain other indebtedness.\nIf the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities terminate their commitments or we are unable to satisfy certain covenants or representations, we may not have access to funding in a timely manner, or at all, when we require it. If funding is not available under the senior secured credit facilities when we require it, our ability to continue our business practices or pursue our current strategy could be limited. If any indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities or our senior notes is accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay such amounts in full, and the lenders and/or noteholders could foreclose on the collateral securing the obligations under the senior secured credit facilities and the senior notes, including, subject to regulatory approval, the stock of NMIC and Re One. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur existing, and any future, variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nAny indebtedness we may incur under our senior secured credit facilities and our future indebtedness may be subject to variable rates of interest, exposing us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on such variable rate indebtedness would increase, resulting in a reduction of our net income that could be significant, even though the principal amount borrowed would remain the same.\nDespite our substantial level of debt, we may incur more debt, which could exacerbate any or all of the risks described above.\nWe may incur substantial additional debt in the future, including up to $250 million in borrowings we may choose to make under our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. Although the credit agreement governing our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture governing our senior secured notes each limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, we may incur additional debt in compliance with these restrictions. In addition, our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility and indenture does not prevent us from incurring certain obligations that do not constitute \"indebtedness\" as defined therein. To the extent that we incur additional debt or such other obligations, the risks associated with our credit agreement and indenture described above, including our possible inability to service our debt or other obligations, would increase.\nOur current credit ratings may adversely affect our ability to access capital and the cost of such capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur current issuer credit and debt ratings are below investment grade. Our current credit ratings, or any future negative actions the credit agencies may take, could affect our ability to access the reinsurance, credit and capital markets in the future and could lead to worsened trade terms, adversely affecting the cost. An inability to access reinsurance, capital and credit markets when needed to continue to grow our business, refinance our existing debt or raise new debt or equity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe do not currently pay any dividends on our common stock and may not pay any dividends on our common stock in the future, and payment of any declared dividends may be delayed.\nWe have not declared or paid dividends in the past, and we may not pay dividends in the future. As a result, until we otherwise declare and pay dividends on our common stock, only appreciation in the price of our common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to investors. Any future declaration and payment of dividends by our Board will depend on many factors, including general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans, our financial results and condition, legal requirements and other factors that our Board deems relevant. In addition, we may enter into additional credit agreements or other debt arrangements in the future that could restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially and be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for stockholders to sell their shares of our common stock at the volume, prices and times desired. There are many factors that impact the market price of our common stock, including, without limitation:\n\u2022general market conditions, including price levels and volume and changes in interest rates;\n\u2022national, regional and local economic or business conditions;\n\u2022the effects of, and changes in, trade, tax, monetary and fiscal policies, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve;\n\u2022changes in U.S. housing and housing finance policy, including changes to the GSEs and the role of government MIs;\n\u2022our actual or projected financial condition, liquidity, operating results, cash flows and capital levels;\n\u2022changes in, or failure to meet, our publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial and operating performance;\n\u2022publication of research reports about us, our competitors or the financial services industry generally, or changes in, or failure to meet, securities analysts' estimates of our financial and operating performance, or lack of research reports by industry analysts or ceasing of coverage;\n\u2022market valuations, as well as the financial and operating performance and prospects, of similar companies;\n\u2022future issuances or sales, or anticipated issuances or sales, of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock;\n\u2022additional indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n\u2022expenses incurred in connection with changes in our stock price, such as changes in the value of the liability reflected on our financial statements associated with outstanding warrants;\n\u2022the potential failure to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel and management;\n\u2022our failure to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ; and\n\u2022our failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, stockholders of certain companies other than NMIH have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against such companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources and harm our business or operating results.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale, and future issuances of our common stock may depress our share price and dilute the book value of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 85,792,849 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market in the future, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future, at a time and place that we deem appropriate.\nIn addition, we have filed registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register an aggregate of 5.5 million shares of our common stock for issuance under our 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (2012 Plan) and an aggregate of 6 million shares of our common stock for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2014 Plan, and together with the 2012 Plan, the Stock Plans). Any shares issued under our Stock Plans, including as a result of the exercise of stock options, would dilute the percentage ownership held by investors who purchase our shares prior to such issuance.\nWe have the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders except as required under NASDAQ rules, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock, including shares that may be issued to satisfy our obligations under our Stock Plans, and securities and instruments that are convertible into shares of our common stock. Such stock issuances could be made at a price that reflects a discount or a premium from the then-current trading price of our common stock and might dilute the book value of our common stock or result in a decrease in the per share price of our common stock.\nFuture issuance of debt or preferred stock, which would rank senior to our Class A common stock upon our liquidation, may adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nShares of our common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness of NMIH. In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by issuing additional debt, including bank debt, commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes or classes of shares of preferred stock. Our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that would limit amounts available for distribution to holders of shares of our common stock. Accordingly, if we were liquidated, holders of our debt securities and preferred stock and lenders with respect to our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility or other future borrowings, if any, would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of shares of our common stock. Any decision to issue debt or preferred stock in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors, some of which will be beyond our control. We cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of such future issuances. Holders of our common stock bear the risk of such future issuances of debt or preferred stock reducing the market value of our common stock.\nProvisions contained in our organizational documents, as well as provisions of Delaware law and Wisconsin insurance law, could delay or prevent a change of control of us, which could adversely affect the price of shares of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board. Our corporate governance documents include provisions that:\n\u2022provide that special meetings of our stockholders generally can only be called by the chairman of the Board or the president or by resolution of the Board;\n\u2022provide our Board the ability to issue undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may grant preferred holders voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holder of common stock;\n\u2022provide our Board the ability to issue common stock and warrants within the amount of authorized capital;\n\u2022provide that, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock with respect to such series of preferred stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of our stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders; and\n\u2022provide that stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders, generally must provide timely advance notice of their intent in writing and certain other information not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the meeting.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes of control of the Company or changes in our management. Additionally, cumulative voting in the election of our directors in not allowed.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of The Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a public Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination (as defined in such section) with an \"interested stockholder\" (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation or any person affiliated with such person) for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless (i) prior to such time, the board of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the\ntransaction commenced (excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan); or (iii) on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder.\nIn addition, Wisconsin's insurance laws and regulations generally provide that no person may acquire control of us unless the transaction in which control is acquired has been approved by the Wisconsin OCI. The regulations provide for a rebuttable presumption of control when a person owns or has the right to vote more than 10% of our voting securities. In addition, the insurance laws and regulations of other states in which NMIC and/or Re One are licensed insurers require notification to the state's insurance department a specified period before a person acquires control of us. If regulators in these states disapprove the change of control, our licenses to conduct business in the disapproving states could be terminated.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law or under the Wisconsin insurance regulations that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14318, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "NMIH"}
