{"cik": "834285", "company": "REPUBLIC FIRST BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-10-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information included elsewhere in this report and in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition,\u201d the following factors could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects. Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual results may be materially adversely affected. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial which could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the coronavirus can be controlled and abated. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we could be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u2022\nDemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\nIf the economy worsens, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\nCollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value;\n\u2022\nOur allowance for credit losses may have to be increased if economic conditions worsen or if borrowers experience financial difficulties;\n\u2022\nThe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n\u2022\nOur cyber security risks are increased as a result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely; and\n\u2022\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums may increase if the agency experiences additional resolution costs.\nMoreover, our future success and profitability substantially depends on the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the outbreak could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nAny one or a combination of the factors identified above, or other factors, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to our Lending Activities\nWe are subject to credit risk in connection with our lending activities, and our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and other factors that adversely affect our borrowers.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are affected by the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, and in a timely manner. Lending money is a significant part of our banking business. Borrowers, however, do not always repay their loans. The risk of non-payment is assessed through our underwriting and loan review procedures based on several factors including credit risks of a particular borrower, changes in economic conditions, the duration of the loan, and in the case of a collateralized loan, uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral and other factors. Despite our efforts, we do and will experience loan losses, and our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. Our non-performing assets were approximately $12.5 million at December 31, 2021. Our allowance for loan losses was approximately $19.0 million at December 31, 2021. Our loans between 30-89 days delinquent totaled $9.6 million at December 31, 2021.\nOur concentration of commercial real estate loans could result in increased loan losses and costs of compliance.\nAt December 31, 2021, commercial real estate loans totaled $780.3 million, or 31.0% of our loan portfolio. Given their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial real estate loans generally have more risk than the single-family residential loans that we originate. Because the repayment of commercial real estate loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy. If we foreclose on these loans, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for a single-family residential property because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. In addition, commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to single-family residential loans. Accordingly, charge-offs on commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred by our single-family residential real estate or consumer loan portfolios.\nThe commercial real estate market is cyclical and poses risks of loss to us because of the concentration of commercial real estate loans in our loan portfolio, and the lack of diversity in risk associated with such a concentration. Banking regulators have been giving and continue to give commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny, and banks with larger commercial real estate loan portfolios are expected by their regulators to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress-testing practices to manage risks associated with commercial real estate lending. In addition, commercial real estate lenders are making greater provisions for credit losses and accumulating higher capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending exposures. Additional losses or regulatory requirements related to our commercial real estate loan concentration could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to absorb actual loan losses, and we may be required to make further provisions for credit losses and charge off additional loans in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses, established through a provision for credit losses accounted for as an expense, which is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio. If our allowance for credit losses is inadequate, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses. Increases in nonperforming loans have a significant impact on our allowance for credit losses. Our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to absorb actual loan losses. If trends in the real estate markets were to deteriorate, we could experience increased delinquencies and credit losses, particularly with respect to real estate construction and land acquisition and development loans and one-to four-family residential mortgage loans. As a result, we may have to make provisions for credit losses and charge off loans in the future, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to our internal processes for determining loss allowances, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase the provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that differ from those of our management. Any increases in our allowance for credit losses will result in a decrease in net income and capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur mortgage banking revenue and the value of our mortgage servicing rights can be volatile.\nIn 2021, we originated $579.8 million residential mortgage loans and sold $398.7 million of those loans to investors in the secondary market. The residential mortgage business is highly competitive, and highly susceptible to changes in market interest rates, consumer confidence levels, employment statistics, the capacity and willingness of secondary market purchasers to acquire and hold or securitize loans, and other factors beyond our control.\nBecause we sell a substantial number of the mortgage loans we originate, the profitability of our mortgage banking business also depends in large part on our ability to originate a high volume of loans and sell them in the secondary market at a gain. In fact, as rates rise, we expect (1) the demand for mortgage loans to fall thereby reducing loan origination volume and (2) increasing industry-wide competitive pressures reducing our pricing margins, both of which would reduce our mortgage revenues. Thus, in addition to our dependence on the interest rate environment, we are dependent upon (1) the existence of an active secondary market and (2) our ability to profitably sell loans or securities into that market. If our level of mortgage production declines, the profitability will depend upon our ability to reduce our costs commensurate with the reduction of revenue from our mortgage operations.\nOur ability to originate and sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans, which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by government-sponsored entities (\u201cGSEs\u201d) and other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. We are highly dependent on these purchasers continuing their mortgage purchasing programs. Additionally, because the largest participants in the secondary market are Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, GSEs whose activities are governed by federal law, any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of these GSEs could, in turn, adversely affect our operations. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship by the U.S. government. The federal government has for many years considered proposals to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but the results of any such reform, and their impact on us, are difficult to predict. To date, no reform proposal has been enacted.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses in some circumstances, which could harm liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe sell a large portion of the mortgage loans that we originate. When mortgage loans are sold, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including the GSEs, about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Whole loan sale agreements require that we repurchase or substitute mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses in the event we breach these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan, resulting in these mortgage loans being placed on our books and subjecting us to the risk of a potential default. A subsequent sale of a repurchased mortgage loan could be at a significant discount to the unpaid principal balance. The Company maintains a reserve for repurchased loans. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims and are in excess of our provision for potential losses, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may be exposed to environmental liabilities with respect to real estate that we have or had title to in the past.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. In the course of our business, we may foreclose, accept deeds in lieu of foreclosure, or otherwise acquire real estate in connection with our lending activities. We also acquire real estate in connection with our store expansion plans and growth strategy. As a result, we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may become responsible to a governmental agency or third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with environmental investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before acquiring title to any real property, these may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities, it could materially and adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Accounting and Disclosure Matters\nWe are required to make significant estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements, including our allowance for loan losses, and our estimates and assumptions may not be accurate.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or \u201cGAAP,\u201d require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. These estimates and assumptions are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. The critical estimates are made by management in determining, among other things, the allowance for loan losses and the realization of deferred income taxes. If our underlying estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur assets as of December 31, 2021 included a deferred tax asset and we may not be able to realize the full amount of such asset.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2021, the net deferred tax asset was $14.2 million, compared to a balance of $12.0 million at December 31, 2020.\nWe regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management\u2019s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.\nBased on the analysis of the available positive and negative evidence, we determined that a valuation allowance should not be recorded as of December 31, 2021. We used projections of future taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary timing differences and carryforwards, as a factor to project recoverability of the deferred tax asset balance. There can be no assurance as to when or whether we will be in a position to fully recapture the benefits of our deferred tax asset. Further discussion on the analysis of our deferred tax asset can be found in the \u201cProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\u201d section of Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOur failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures related to the structure and operations of our corporate governance may result in current and potential shareholders losing confidence in our financial reporting and disclosures and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, referred to as Section 404, we are required to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting.\nAs part of our ongoing monitoring of internal and disclosure controls for the year ended December 31, 2021, we discovered material weaknesses in our internal and disclosure controls that required remediation. See \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d Effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and disclosures to shareholders, to prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and disclosures or prevent fraud, our business may be adversely affected, our reputation and operating results could be harmed could and our current and potential shareholders and customers could lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the Exchange Act, which could adversely affect our business.\nControl processes that involve human diligence and compliance, such as our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, are subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Controls can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there are risks that material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected and that information may not be reported on a timely basis. If our controls are not effective, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and market for our common stock, and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny.\nManagement concluded there were deficiencies in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting that represented material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, including from a failure to maintain an effective control environment, which resulted in deficiencies in the communication of certain relevant information to the Board of Directors of the Company, including information related to branch expenditures. While the material weaknesses did not result in a misstatement of the Company\u2019s financial statements, effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and disclosures to shareholders, to prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and disclosures or prevent fraud, our business may be adversely affected, our reputation and operating results could be harmed and our current and potential shareholders and customers could lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the Exchange Act, which could adversely affect our business. For more information, see \u201cItem 9A: Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\u201d\nContinued delays in the filing of our periodic reports with the SEC could impact our listing on Nasdaq, which would materially and adversely affect our stock price, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nAs a result of an independent review concerning related party transactions, the Company\u2019s internal controls, and the associated financial statement and disclosure implications, and the evaluation of such independent review by the Company\u2019s Audit Committee and management and by the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm in connection with the audit of the Company\u2019s financial statements as of an for the year ended December 31, 2021, we were unable to file this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC on a timely basis. We have not filed our Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, which were due in May 2022 and August 2022, respectively. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. If we are not able to file our delinquent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our common stock may be subject to delisting by Nasdaq.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by other-than-temporary impairment charges relating to our investment portfolio.\nIn prior years we recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain bank pooled trust preferred securities, and we may be required to record future impairment charges on our investment securities if they suffer declines in value that we determine are other-than-temporary. Numerous factors, including the lack of liquidity for re-sales of certain investment securities, the absence of reliable pricing information for investment securities, adverse changes in the business climate, adverse regulatory actions or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment, could have a negative effect on our investment portfolio in future periods. If an impairment charge is significant enough, it could affect the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends, which could materially adversely affect us. Significant impairment charges could also negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios and result in us not being classified as \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for regulatory purposes.\nA significant percentage of our assets is invested in securities, which typically have a lower yield than our loan portfolio.\nOur results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income. At December 31, 2021, 50.7% of our assets were invested in investment securities and cash and cash equivalents. These investments yield substantially less than the loans we hold in our portfolio. While we intend to invest a greater proportion of our assets in loans with the goal of increasing our net interest income, we may not be able to increase originations of loans that are acceptable to us. Further, at December 31, 2021, $1.7 billion, or 60.7%, of our securities portfolio was designated as held to maturity. As a result, we are unable to sell these securities to respond to changes in interest rates that may occur in the future.\nUnfavorable economic and financial market conditions may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nEconomic pressure on consumers and businesses, the impact of inflation, any resulting lack of confidence in the financial markets, the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and the responses thereto, risks related to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, including, but not limited to, the impact from, and compliance with, economic sanctions, and concerns surrounding the long term fiscal position of the United States may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. A worsening of current economic conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of market conditions on us and others in the industry. In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:\n\u25cf\nincreased regulation of our industry and increased compliance costs;\n\u25cf\nhampering our ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the losses inherent in our credit exposure, as such assessments are made more complex by these difficult market and economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nincreasing our credit risk, by increasing the likelihood that our customers are unable to satisfy their obligations to us;\n\u25cf\nimpairing our ability to originate loans, by making our customers and prospective customers less willing to borrow, and making loans that meet our underwriting criteria difficult to find; and\n\u25cf\nlimiting our interest income, by depressing the yields we are able to earn on our investment portfolio.\nOur business is concentrated in and dependent upon the continued growth and welfare of our primary market area.\nOur primary service area consists of Greater Philadelphia, Southern New Jersey, and New York City. Our success depends upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in this area. Although our customers\u2019 businesses and financial interests may extend well beyond this area, adverse economic conditions that affect our primary service area could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us, and generally adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because of our geographic concentration, we are less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets.\nA transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as a reference rate for financial instruments could negatively affect our income and expenses and the value of various financial instruments.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the United States and globally as a benchmark for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks, which may stop reporting such information after 2021. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020, to facilitate an orderly LIBOR transition, the OCC, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve Board jointly announced that entering into new contracts using LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021 would create a safety and soundness risk. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of 1-week and 2-month LIBOR, and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining LIBOR settings. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates are ongoing, and the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\"ARRC\") has recommended the use of a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\"SOFR\"). SOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a backward-looking secured rate rather than a forward-looking unsecured rate.\nThere are operational issues, which may create a delay in the transition to SOFR or other substitute indices, leading to uncertainty across the industry. These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives over loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit.\nRisks Related to Market Interest Rates\nOur net interest income, net income and results of operations are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates.\nOur net income depends on the net income of Republic, and Republic is dependent primarily upon its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the interest paid on its interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nOur results of operations will be affected by changes in market interest rates and other economic factors beyond our control. If our interest-earning assets have longer effective maturities than our interest-bearing liabilities, the yield on our interest-earning assets generally will adjust more slowly than the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, and, as a result, our net interest income generally will be adversely affected by material and prolonged increases in interest rates, and positively affected by comparable declines in interest rates. Conversely, if liabilities re-price more slowly than assets, net interest income would be adversely affected by declining interest rates, and positively affected by increasing interest rates. At any time, our assets and liabilities will reflect interest rate risk of some degree.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A decline in interest rates generally results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Furthermore, an inverted interest rate yield curve, where short-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions borrow funds) are higher than long-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions lend funds for fixed-rate loans) can reduce a financial institution\u2019s net interest margin and create financial risk for financial institutions that originate longer-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans.\nIn addition to affecting interest income and expense, changes in interest rates also can affect the value of our interest-earning assets, comprising fixed and adjustable-rate instruments, as well as the ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets. Generally, the value of fixed-rate instruments fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates, and changes in interest rates may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business Strategy\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value.\nWe regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire and invest in banks and in other complementary businesses. As a result, we may engage in negotiations or discussions that, if they were to result in a transaction, could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u25cf\nincurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions;\n\u25cf\nusing inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to the target institution or its assets;\n\u25cf\ndiluting our tangible book value and earnings per share in the short- and long-term by payment of a premium over book and market values;\n\u25cf\nincurring potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n\u25cf\nexposing ourselves to potential asset quality problems of the target company;\n\u25cf\ndiluting current shareholders\u2019 ownership interest by issuing additional shares of common stock;\n\u25cf\nrecording goodwill, which if impaired would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings;\n\u25cf\nfailing to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits of the acquisition;\n\u25cf\npotential disrupting our business;\n\u25cf\nthe time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u25cf\ncreating an adverse short-term effect on our results of operations; and\n\u25cf\nlosing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly conceived.\nWe may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth, which may adversely impact our financial results.\nAs part of our retail growth strategy, we may expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current markets by opening new stores and acquiring existing branches of other financial institutions. To the extent that we undertake additional stores openings and acquisitions, we are likely to experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations, which may have an adverse effect on our levels of reported net income, return on average equity and return on average assets. Other effects of engaging in such growth strategies may include potential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention and general disruption to our business.\nAs part of our retail strategy, we plan to open new stores in our primary service area, including Southern New Jersey, the Greater Philadelphia area, and New York City. We may not, however, be able to identify attractive locations on terms favorable to us, obtain regulatory approvals, or hire qualified management to operate new stores. In addition, the organizational and overhead costs may be greater than we anticipate. New stores may take longer than expected to reach profitability, or may not become profitable. The additional costs of starting new stores may adversely impact our financial results.\nOur ability to manage growth successfully will depend on whether we can continue to fund our growth while maintaining cost controls, as well as on factors beyond our control, such as national and regional economic conditions and interest rate trends. If we are not able to control costs, such growth could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition.\nOur retail strategy relies heavily on our management team, and the unexpected loss of key managers may adversely affect our operations.\nIn recent years, we have been successful in attracting new and talented employees to our management team. We believe that our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy will require us to retain and attract additional management experienced in banking and financial services, and familiar with the communities in our market. Our ability to retain executive officers, the current management team, branch managers and loan officers of Republic will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategy. It is also critical, as we grow, to be able to attract and retain additional members of the management team and qualified loan officers with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about our market areas to implement the community-based operating strategy. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we want to, or are compelled to, raise additional capital in the future, that capital may not be available to us when it is needed or on terms that are favorable to us or current shareholders.\nFederal banking regulators require us, and Republic, to maintain capital to support our operations. Regulatory capital ratios are defined and required ratios are established by laws and regulations promulgated by banking regulatory agencies. At December 31, 2021, our regulatory capital ratios were above \u201cwell capitalized\u201d levels under current bank regulatory guidelines. To be \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d banking companies generally must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%, a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%. Regulators, however, may require us, or Republic, to maintain higher regulatory capital ratios.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources to meet our commitments and business needs. We may also at some point need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth. Our ability to raise additional capital in the future will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, on our financial performance and on other factors. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital on terms and time frames acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital in sufficient amounts when needed, our ability to comply with regulatory capital requirements could be materially impaired. Additionally, the inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to raise capital could also be impaired by factors that are nonspecific to us, such as disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. If we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities, we would dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders, and could dilute the per share book value and earnings per share of our common stock. Furthermore, a capital raise through issuance of additional shares may have an adverse impact on our stock price.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nWe are subject to numerous governmental regulations and to comprehensive examination and supervision by regulators, which could have an adverse impact on our operations and could restrict the scope of our operations.\nBoth the Company and Republic operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to supervision and regulation by several governmental regulatory agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (\u201cPDB\u201d). We are subject to federal and state regulations governing virtually all aspects of our activities, including lines of business, capital, liquidity, investments, payment of dividends, and others. Regulations that apply to us are generally intended to provide protection for depositors and customers rather than investors.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. See Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation. The requirements and limitations imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. Financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is within our control. Compliance with these rules could impose additional costs on banking entities and their holding companies. Management has reviewed the new standards and will continue to evaluate all options and strategies to ensure ongoing compliance with the new standards, notwithstanding Republic\u2019s current status as well-capitalized.\nNew programs and proposals may subject us and other financial institutions to additional restrictions, oversight and costs that may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our common stock. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied or enforced. We cannot predict the substance or impact of future legislation, regulation or the application thereof. Compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.\nAny change in regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firm. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Competition\nWe face significant competition in our market from other banks and financial institutions.\nThe banking and financial services industry in our market area is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. We may not be able to compete effectively in our markets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The increasingly competitive environment is a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, and consolidation among financial service providers. Larger institutions have greater access to capital markets, with higher lending limits and a broader array of services. Competition may require increases in deposit rates and decreases in loan rates, and adversely impact our net interest margin. Competition also makes it increasingly difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of new legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks, such as financial technology companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.\nRisks Related to Operational Matters\nWe may not have the resources to effectively implement new technologies, which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is constantly undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand in our market. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to offer, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers. If we are unable to do so, our competitive position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee or customer errors and misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee or customer errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors, and customer or employee fraud. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage, these security measures may not be successful. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThere may be future sales of our common stock, which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common or preferred stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock. Our issuance of shares of common stock, preferred stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock in the future will dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders.\nAdditionally, the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, whether directly by us or by existing common shareholders in the secondary market, the perception that such sales could occur or the availability for future sale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock could, in turn, materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Governance Matters\nOur governing documents, Pennsylvania law, and current policies of our Board of Directors contain provisions, which may reduce the likelihood of a change in control transaction, which may otherwise be available and attractive to shareholders.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive or may discourage a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our Board of Directors. In particular, the articles of incorporation and bylaws: classify our Board of Directors into three groups, so that shareholders elect only approximately one-third of the Board each year; permit shareholders to remove directors only for cause and only upon the vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting shares; require our shareholders to give us advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the Board of Directors or to make shareholder proposals at a shareholders\u2019 meeting; require the vote of the holders of at least 75% of our voting shares for shareholder amendments to our bylaws; require the vote of the holders of at least 75% of our voting shares to approve certain business combinations; and restrict the holdings and voting rights of shareholders who would acquire more than 10% of our outstanding common stock without the approval of two-thirds of our Board of Directors. These provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, even though a majority of our shareholders may consider such proposals desirable. Such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace the members of our Board of Directors. Moreover, these provisions could diminish the opportunities for shareholders to participate in certain tender offers, including tender offers at prices above the then-current market value of our common stock, and may also prevent increases in the trading price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts or speculation.\nIn addition, anti-takeover provisions in Pennsylvania and federal law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. These provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that shareholders might receive if we are sold. For example, Pennsylvania and federal law may restrict a third party\u2019s ability to obtain control of us and may prevent shareholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock.\nOur business could be impacted by a potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nIn December 2021, Driver Management Company LLC (together with its affiliates, the \"Activist Investor\"), announced the nomination of three candidates for election to our Board of Directors at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. A proxy contest with the Activist Investor for the election of directors could result in us incurring substantial costs, including proxy solicitation, public relations, and legal fees. Further, such a proxy contest could divert the attention of our Board of Directors, management, and employees, and may disrupt the momentum in our business and operations, as well as our ability to execute our strategic plan. The actions of the Activist Investor may also create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy, which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and may impact our relationship with investors, vendors, and other third parties. A proxy contest could also impact the market price and the volatility of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12166, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FRBK"}
