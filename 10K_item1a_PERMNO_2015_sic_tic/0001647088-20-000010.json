Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe face significant competition in the modular space and portable storage unit industry. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose customers and our revenue and profitability could decline.\nAlthough our competition varies significantly by market, the modular space and portable storage unit industry is highly competitive in general. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including customer relationships, product quality and availability, delivery speed, VAPS and service capabilities, pricing, and overall ease of doing business. We may experience pricing pressures in our operations as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices, and we may face reduced demand for our products and services if our competitors are able to provide new or innovative products or services that better appeal to customers. In most of our end markets, we face competition from national, regional and local companies who have an established market position in the specific service area, and we expect to encounter similar competition in any new markets that we may enter. In certain markets, some of our competitors may have greater market share, less debt, greater pricing flexibility, more attractive product or service offerings, or superior marketing and financial resources. Increased competition could result in lower profit margins, substantial pricing pressure and reduced market share. Price competition, together with other forms of competition, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are exposed to operational, economic, political and regulatory risks.\nWe operate in the US, Canada and Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 90.9%, 7.6%, and 1.5% of our revenue was generated in the US, Canada and Mexico, respectively. Our operations in these countries could be affected by foreign and domestic economic, political and regulatory risks, including the following:\n\u2022 regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to assemble, lease or sell\nproducts;\n\u2022 inflation, recession, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates;\n\u2022 trade protection measures, including increased duties and taxes and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022 compliance with applicable antitrust and other regulatory rules and regulations relating to potential acquisitions;\n\u2022 different local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022 pressures on management time and attention due to the complexities of overseeing multi-national operations;\n\u2022 challenges in maintaining staffing;\n\u2022 different labor regulations and the potential impact of collective bargaining;\n\u2022 potentially adverse consequences from changes in, or interpretations of, tax laws;\n\u2022 political and economic instability;\n\u2022 enforcement of remedies in various jurisdictions;\n\u2022 the risk that the business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance will not perform as expected;\n\u2022 compliance with applicable export control laws and economic sanctions laws and regulations;\n\u2022 price controls and ownership regulations;\n\u2022 obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash;\n\u2022 differences in business practices that may result in violation of company policies, including, but not limited to, bribery\nand collusive practices; and\n\u2022 reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries.\nThese and other risks may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGlobal or local economic movements could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate our business in the US, Canada and Mexico. Our business may be negatively impacted by economic movements or downturns in the local markets in which we operate or global markets generally. These adverse economic conditions may reduce commercial activity, cause disruption and extreme volatility in global financial markets and increase rates of default and bankruptcy. Reduced commercial activity has historically resulted in reduced demand for our products and services. For example, reduced commercial activity in the construction, energy and natural resources sectors in certain markets in which we operate, particularly the US and Canada, has negatively impacted our business in the past. Disruptions in financial markets could negatively impact the ability of our customers to pay their obligations to us in a timely manner and increase our counterparty risk. If economic conditions worsen, we may face reduced demand and an increase, relative to historical levels, in the time it takes to receive customer payments. If we are not able to adjust our business in a timely and\neffective manner to changing economic conditions, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nMoreover, the level of demand for our products and services is sensitive to the level of demand within various sectors, particularly the commercial and industrial, construction, education, energy and natural resources, and government end markets. Each of these sectors is influenced not only by the state of the general global economy, but also by a number of more specific factors as well. For example, a decline in global or local energy prices may materially adversely affect demand for modular buildings within the energy and resources sector. The levels of activity in these sectors and geographic regions may also be cyclical, and we may not be able to predict the timing, extent or duration of the activity cycles in the markets in which we or our key customers operate. A decline or slowed growth in any of these sectors or geographic regions could result in reduced demand for our products and services, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEffective management of our fleet is vital to our business, and our failure to properly safeguard, design, manufacture, repair and maintain our fleet could harm our business and reduce our operating results and cash flows.\nOur modular space and portable storage units have long economic lives and managing our fleet is a critical element to our leasing business. Rental equipment asset management requires designing and building long-lived products that anticipate customer needs and changes in legislation, regulations, building codes and local permitting in the various markets in which we operate. In addition, we must cost-effectively maintain and repair our fleet to maximize the economic life of the products and the proceeds we receive from product sales. As the needs of our customers change, we may incur costs to relocate or retrofit our assets to better meet shifts in demand. If the distribution of our assets is not aligned with regional demand, we may be unable to take advantage of sales and leasing opportunities in certain regions, despite excess inventory in other regions. If we are not able to successfully manage our lease assets, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we do not appropriately manage the design, manufacture, repair and maintenance of our product fleet, or if we delay or defer such repair or maintenance or suffer unexpected losses of rental equipment due to theft or obsolescence, we may be required to incur impairment charges for equipment that is beyond economic repair or incur significant capital expenditures to acquire new rental equipment to serve demand. These failures may also result in personal injury or property damage claims, including claims based on poor indoor air quality and termination of leases or contracts by customers. Costs of contract performance, potential litigation and profits lost from termination could materially adversely affect our future operating results and cash flows.\nTrade policies and changes in trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, their enforcement and downstream consequences, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and outlook.\nTariffs and/or other developments with respect to trade policies, trade agreements and government regulations may materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the US government has imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum and lumber imports from certain countries, which could result in increased costs to us for these materials. Without limitation, (i) tariffs currently in place and (ii) the imposition by the federal government of new tariffs on imports to the US could materially increase (a) the cost of our products that we are offering for sale or lease, (b) the cost of certain products that we source from foreign manufacturers, and (c) the cost of certain raw materials or products that we utilize. We may not be able to pass such increased costs on to our customers, and we may not be able to secure sources of certain products and materials that are not subject to tariffs on a timely basis. Although we actively monitor our procurement policies and practices to avoid undue reliance on foreign-sourced goods subject to tariffs, when practicable, such developments may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to acquire and integrate new operations, which could cause our business to suffer.\nWe may be unable to complete strategic acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses or assets into our operations for various reasons. We completed the Modular Space Holdings, Inc., or ModSpace, and Acton Mobile Holdings LLC, or Acton, acquisitions in 2018 and 2017. While the ModSpace and Acton integrations are substantially complete, we may explore acquisitions in the future that meet our strategic growth plans. We cannot predict if or when acquisitions will be completed, and we may face significant competition for acquisition targets. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business;\n\u2022loss of key employees;\n\u2022difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and where our competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u2022difficulties in complying with regulations, such as environmental regulations, and managing risks related to an acquired business;\n\u2022an inability to timely obtain financing, including any amendments required to existing financing agreements;\n\u2022an inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022undiscovered and unknown problems, defects, liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only after the acquisition, particularly relating to rental equipment on lease that are unavailable for inspection during the diligence process; and\n\u2022loss of key customers, suppliers or employees.\nIn connection with acquisitions, we may assume liabilities or acquire damaged assets, some of which may be unknown to us at the time of such acquisitions.\nWe assess the condition and regulatory certification of an acquired fleet as part of our acquisition due diligence. In some cases, fleet condition or regulatory certification may be difficult to determine due to the fleet being on lease at the time of acquisition and/or inadequate certification records. Fleet acquisitions may therefore result in a rectification cost that we may not have factored into the acquisition price, impacting deployability and ultimate profitability of the fleet we acquired.\nIn particular, we have made two major acquisitions (Acton and ModSpace) since November 29, 2017. Although we have substantially integrated the acquired businesses and assets into our organization and platforms, we must continue to take actions in 2020 to realize the combined cost synergies that we forecast for those acquisitions. We may incur more costs than we anticipated to achieve the forecast synergies (thus reducing the net benefit of the cost synergies), realize synergies later than we expected or fail altogether to achieve a portion of the cost savings we anticipated. Any of these events could cause reductions in our earnings per share, impact our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility, decrease or delay the accretive effect of the acquisitions that we anticipated and negatively impact our stock price.\nAcquisitions are inherently risky, and we cannot provide assurance that any future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we do not manage new markets effectively, some of our new branches and acquisitions may lose money or fail, and we may have to close unprofitable branches. Closing a branch in such circumstances would likely result in additional expenses that would cause our operating results to suffer. To manage growth successfully, we will need to continue to identify additional qualified managers and employees to integrate acquisitions within our established operating, financial and other internal procedures and controls. We will also need to effectively motivate, train and manage our employees. Failure to successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions and new branches into existing operations could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not manage our credit risk effectively, collect on our accounts receivable, or recover our rental equipment from our customers, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe perform credit evaluation procedures on our customers on each transaction and require security deposits or other forms of security from our customers when we identify a significant credit risk. Failure to manage our credit risk and receive timely payments on our customer accounts receivable may result in the write-off of customer receivables and loss of units if we are unable to recover our rental equipment from our customers\u2019 sites. If we are not able to manage credit risk, or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our credit and rental equipment losses would increase above historical levels. If this should occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had US net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $899.5 million and $619.9 million for US federal income tax and state tax purposes, respectively, available to offset future taxable income, prior to consideration of annual limitations that Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 may impose. The US NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2019 for state and 2022 for federal if not utilized. In addition, we had foreign NOLs of $20.7 million as a result of our operations in Canada and Mexico. Our Mexico and Canadian NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2021 and 2038, respectively, if not utilized.\nOur US NOL and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and corresponding provisions of US state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its US NOLs and other applicable tax attributes before the ownership change, such as research and development tax credits, to offset its income after the ownership change may be limited. We have completed Section 382 analyses for applicable transactions, and performed utilization analysis under US GAAP. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-ModSpace US NOL carryforwards to offset US federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of US NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nLastly, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our\nhistorical NOL and tax credit carryforwards is materially limited, it may result in increased future tax obligations and income tax expense.\nWe may be unable to recognize deferred tax assets such as those related to our tax loss carryforwards and, as a result, lose future tax savings, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial position.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets primarily related to deductible temporary differences based on our assessment that the item will be utilized against future taxable income and the benefit will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority. Such deductible temporary differences primarily relate to tax loss carryforwards and business interest expense limitations. Tax loss carryforwards arising in a given tax jurisdiction may be carried forward to offset taxable income in future years from such tax jurisdiction and reduce or eliminate income taxes otherwise payable on such taxable income, subject to certain limitations. Deferred interest expense exists primarily within our US operating companies, where interest expense was not previously deductible as incurred but may become deductible in the future subject to certain limitations. We may have to write down, through income tax expense, the carrying amount of certain deferred tax assets to the extent we determine it is not probable we will realize such deferred tax assets.\nSome of the tax loss carryforwards expire and if we do not have sufficient taxable income in future years to use the tax benefits before they expire, the benefit may be permanently lost. In addition, the taxing authorities could challenge our calculation of the amount of our tax attributes, which could reduce certain of our recognized tax benefits. Further, tax laws in certain jurisdictions may limit the ability to use carryforwards upon a change in control.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax obligations, the adoption of a new tax legislation, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the US, Canada and Mexico. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charged for inventory, services, funding and other transactions on an intercompany basis. We are subject to potential tax examinations in these jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations, and the amounts that we ultimately pay upon resolution of examinations could be materially different from the amounts we previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. Changes in tax laws or regulations may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in state building codes could adversely impact our ability to remarket our buildings, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBuilding codes are generally reviewed, debated and, in certain cases, modified on a national level every three years as an ongoing effort to keep the regulations current and improve the life, safety and welfare of the building\u2019s occupants. All aspects of a given code are subject to change, including, but not limited to, such items as structural specifications for earthquake safety, energy efficiency and environmental standards, fire and life safety, transportation, lighting and noise limits. On occasion, state agencies have undertaken studies of indoor air quality and noise levels with a focus on permanent and modular classrooms. This process leads to a systematic change that requires engagement in the process and recognition that past methods will not always be accepted. New modular construction is very similar to conventional construction where newer codes and regulations generally increase cost. New governmental regulations may increase our costs to acquire new rental equipment, as well as increase our costs to refurbish existing equipment.\nCompliance with building codes and regulations entails risk as state and local government authorities do not necessarily interpret building codes and regulations in a consistent manner, particularly where applicable regulations may be unclear and subject to interpretation. These regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities that oversee these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays or increases in the cost of compliance in particular markets. The construction and modular industries have developed many \u201cbest practices\u201d which are constantly evolving. Some of our peers and competitors may adopt practices that are more or less stringent than ours. When, and if, regulators clarify regulatory standards, the effect of the clarification may be to impose rules on our business and practices retroactively, at which time we may not be in compliance with such regulations and we may be required to incur costly remediation. If we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers, our business, financial condition, operating cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur operations face foreign currency exchange rate exposure, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenue and pay expenses in certain currencies other than the US dollar, primarily the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso. Our consolidated financial results are denominated in US dollars, and\ntherefore, during times of a strengthening US dollar, our reported revenue in non-US dollar jurisdictions will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer US dollars. Revenue and expenses are translated into US dollars at the average exchange rate for the period. In addition, the assets and liabilities of our non-US dollar subsidiaries are translated into US dollars at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. Foreign currency exchange adjustments arising from certain intercompany obligations with and between our domestic companies and our foreign subsidiaries are marked-to-market and recorded as a non-cash loss or gain in each of our financial periods in our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, changes in currency exchange rates will cause our foreign currency translation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss to fluctuate. In addition, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the amount of US dollars we receive when we repatriate funds from our non-US dollar operations.\nFluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices may also materially adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we have converted a portion of our senior secured revolving credit facility borrowings into fixed-rate debt through interest rate swaps, a significant portion of our borrowings under the facility remain variable rate debt. Fluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact the amount of interest payments, as well as our ability to refinance portions of our existing debt in the future at attractive interest rates. In addition, certain of our end markets, as well as portions of our cost structure, such as transportation costs, are sensitive to changes in commodity prices, which can impact both demand for and profitability of our services. These changes could impact our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant.\nSignificant increases in raw material and labor costs could increase our operating costs significantly and harm our profitability.\nWe incur labor costs and purchase raw materials, including steel, lumber, siding and roofing, fuel and other products to perform periodic repairs, modifications and refurbishments to maintain physical conditions of our units and in connection with get-ready, delivery and installation of our units. The volume, timing and mix of such work may vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Generally, increases in labor and raw material costs will increase the acquisition costs of new units and also increase the repair and maintenance costs of our fleet. We also maintain a truck fleet to deliver units to and return units from our customers, the cost of which is sensitive to maintenance and fuel costs and rental rates on leased equipment. During periods of rising prices for labor or raw materials, and in particular, when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal, we may incur significant increases in our acquisition costs for new units and higher operating costs that we may not be able to recoup from customers through changes in pricing, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThird parties may fail to manufacture or provide necessary components for our products properly or in a timely manner.\nWe are often dependent on third parties to manufacture or supply components for our products. We typically do not enter into long-term contracts with third-party suppliers. We may experience supply problems as a result of financial or operating difficulties or the failure or consolidation of our suppliers. We may also experience supply problems as a result of shortages and discontinuations resulting from product obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by suppliers. Unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with third parties to secure products that we require in sufficient quantities or on reasonable terms. If we cannot negotiate arrangements with third parties to produce our products or if the third parties fail to produce our products to our specifications or in a timely manner, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks associated with labor relations, labor costs and labor disruptions.\nWe are subject to the costs and risks generally associated with labor disputes and organizing activities related to unionized labor. From time to time, strikes, public demonstrations or other coordinated actions and publicity may disrupt our operations. We may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contractual disputes, negotiations or other labor-related disruptions. We have collective bargaining agreements with employees in portions of our Mexico-based operations, which accounted for approximately 1.0% of our total employees as of December 31, 2019. These operations may be more highly affected by labor force activities than others, and all collective bargaining agreements must be renegotiated annually. Other locations may also face organizing activities or effects. Labor organizing activities could result in additional employees becoming unionized. Furthermore, collective bargaining agreements may limit our ability to reduce the size of work forces during an economic downturn, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nFailure to retain key personnel could impede our ability to execute our business plan and growth strategy.\nOur ability to profitably execute our business plan depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. Certain of our key executives, managers and employees have knowledge and an understanding of our business and our industry, and/or have developed meaningful customer relationships, that cannot be duplicated readily. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is dependent on, among other things, the availability of qualified personnel and our ability to provide a competitive compensation package. Failure to retain qualified key personnel may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMoreover, labor shortages, the inability to hire or retain qualified employees and increased labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to control expenses and efficiently conduct our operations. We may not be able to continue to hire and retain the sufficiently skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our operating strategies. Labor expenses could also increase as a result of continuing shortages in the supply of personnel.\nIf we determine that our goodwill, intangible assets, and indefinite-life intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which may adversely impact our operating results.\nWe have a substantial amount of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets (trade names), which represents the excess of the total purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of the assets acquired, and other intangible assets. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $235.2 million and $126.6 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets, which would represent approximately 8.1% and 4.5% of total assets, respectively.\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset may be below its carrying amount. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to inherent uncertainties and changes in estimates and assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, EBIT margins, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, tax rates, terminal growth rates, discount rates, exchange rates, royalty rates, benefits associated with a taxable transaction and synergistic benefits available to market participants. Declines in market conditions, a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance for our reporting units or declines in projected revenue, a decline in our share price for a sustained period of time, an increase in the market-based weighted average cost of capital or a decrease in royalty rates, among other factors, are indicators that the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite-life intangible assets may not be recoverable. In the event impairment is identified, a charge to earnings would be recorded which may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations, including those governing government contracts, corruption and the environment. Obligations and liabilities under these laws and regulations may materially harm our business.\nGovernment Contract Laws and Regulations\nWe lease and sell our products to government entities, and this subjects us to statutes and regulations applicable to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts can differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain favorable pricing terms and conditions that are not typically included in private contracts, such as clauses that make certain obligations of government entities subject to budget appropriations. Many government contracts can be terminated or modified, in whole or in part, at any time, without penalty, by the government. In addition, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties or the suspension of our government contracts or debarment and, as a result, the loss of the related revenue which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are not aware of any action contemplated by any regulatory authority related to any possible non-compliance by or in connection with our operations.\nOur operations are subject to an array of governmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, our activities in the US are subject to regulation by several federal and state government agencies, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and by federal and state laws. Our operations and activities in other jurisdictions are subject to similar governmental regulations. Similar to conventionally constructed buildings, the modular business industry is also subject to regulations by multiple governmental agencies in each jurisdiction relating to, among others, environmental, zoning and building standards, and health, safety and transportation matters. Noncompliance with applicable regulations, implementation of new regulations or modifications to existing regulations may increase costs of compliance, require a termination of certain activities or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUS Government Contract Laws and Regulations\nOur government customers include the US government, which means we are subject to various statutes and regulations applicable to doing business with the US government. These types of contracts customarily contain provisions that give the US government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts and which are unfavorable to contractors, including provisions that allow the government to unilaterally terminate or modify our federal government contracts, in whole or in part, at the government\u2019s convenience. Under general principles of US government contracting law, if the government terminates a contract for convenience, the terminated company may generally recover only its incurred or committed costs and settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, the defaulting company may be liable for any extra costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source.\nIn addition, US government contracts and grants normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n\u2022 specialized disclosure and accounting requirements unique to US government contracts;\n\u2022 financial and compliance audits that may result in potential liability for price adjustments, recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent, civil and criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions such as suspension or debarment from doing business with the US government;\n\u2022 public disclosures of certain contract and company information; and\n\u2022 mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor requirements, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nIf we fail to comply with these requirements, our contracts may be subject to termination, and we may be subject to financial and/or other liability under our contracts or under the Federal Civil False Claims Act. The False Claims Act\u2019s \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions allow private individuals, including present and former employees, to sue on behalf of the US government. The False Claims Act statute provides for treble damages and other penalties, and if our operations are found to be in violation of the False Claims Act, we could face other adverse action, including suspension or prohibition from doing business with the US government. Any penalties, damages, fines, suspension or damages could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nAnti-Corruption Laws and Regulations\nWe are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials by a US person for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in countries that may present a more corruptible business environment than the US. Such activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various laws, including the FCPA. We have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents. However, existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be ineffective and employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.\nIf employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including suspension or debarment from US government contracting, and we may be subject to other liabilities which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are also subject to similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nWe are subject to a variety of national, state, regional and local environmental laws and regulations. Among other things, these laws and regulations impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of, and establish standards for the use, disposal and management of, regulated materials and waste and impose liabilities for the costs of investigating and cleaning up, and damages resulting from, present and past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or materials. In the ordinary course of business, we use and generate substances that are regulated or may be hazardous under environmental laws. We have an inherent risk of liability under environmental laws and regulations, both with respect to ongoing operations and with respect to contamination that may have occurred in the past on our properties or as a result of our operations. From time to time, our operations or conditions on properties that we have acquired have resulted in liabilities under these environmental laws. We may in the future incur material costs to comply with environmental laws or sustain material liabilities from claims concerning noncompliance or contamination. We have no reserves for any such liabilities.\nWe cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, or what environmental conditions may be found to exist at our facilities or at third party sites for which we may be liable. Enactment of stricter laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the requirement to undertake the investigation or remediation of currently unknown environmental contamination at sites we own or third party sites may require us to make additional expenditures, some of which could be material.\nAny failure of our management information systems could disrupt our business operations both in the field and back office, which could result in decreased lease or sale revenue and increase overhead costs.\nThe failure of our management information systems to perform as anticipated could damage our reputation with our customers, disrupt our business or result in, among other things, decreased lease and sales revenue and increased overhead costs. Any such failure could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively could disrupt our business, distract management\u2019s focus and attention from business operations and growth initiatives and increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.\nWe have previously been the target of an attempted cyber-attack and may be subject to breaches of the information systems that we use. We have not experienced a material cybersecurity breach. We have programs in place that are intended to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and that provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to protect against cyber risks and security breaches. However, because the techniques used to\nobtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, because our systems contain information about individuals and other businesses, the failure to maintain the security of the data we hold, whether the result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenue, increased costs, regulatory sanctions and other potential material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could materially adversely affect our future revenue, financial condition, cash flows and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions such as fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and terrorism, which could adversely affect our future revenue, financial condition, and cash flows and increase our costs and expenses. In addition, the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks may directly or indirectly affect economic conditions, which could adversely affect demand for our products and services. In the event of a major natural or man-made disaster, we could experience loss of life of our employees, destruction of facilities or business interruptions, any of which may materially adversely affect our business. If any of our facilities or a significant amount of our rental equipment were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay orders, shipments and revenue recognition and result in expenses to repair or replace the damaged rental equipment and facility not covered by asset, liability, business continuity or other insurance contracts. Also, we could face significant increases in premiums or losses of coverage due to the loss experienced during and associated with these and potential future natural or man-made disasters that may materially adversely affect our business. In addition, attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact one or more of our properties could significantly affect our ability to operate those properties and thereby impair our results of operations.\nIn general, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the global economy and worldwide financial markets. Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.\nWe are predominantly self-insured for a number of different risk categories, such as property, general liability (including product liability), workers' compensation, automobile claims, crime, and cyber liability, with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. The occurrence of significant claims, a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance, or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to redeploy our units effectively should a significant number of our leased units be returned during a short period of time, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWhile our typical lease terms include contractual provisions requiring customers to retain units on lease for a specified period, our customers generally rent their units for periods longer than the contractual lease terms. As of December 31, 2019, the average lease duration of our current lease portfolio is approximately 34 months. If a significant number of leased units are returned in a short period of time, a large supply of units would need to be remarketed. Our failure to effectively remarket a large influx of units returning from leases could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nFailure to close our unit sales transactions as we project could cause our actual revenue or cash flow for a particular fiscal period to differ from expectations.\nSales of new and used modular space and portable storage units to customers represented approximately 9.3% of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019. Sale transactions are subject to certain factors that are beyond our control, including permit requirements, the timely completion of prerequisite work by others, and weather conditions. Accordingly, the actual timing of the completion of these transactions may take longer than we expect. As a result, our actual revenue and cash flow in a particular fiscal period may not consistently correlate to our internal operational plans and budgets. If we are unable to accurately predict the timing of these sales, we may fail to take advantage of business and growth opportunities otherwise available and our business, results of operations and financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. There is no assurance that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur or that we will be successful in adequately remediating any such material weaknesses and significant deficiencies. We may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting and financial processes. Furthermore, as we\ngrow our business, including through acquisition, our internal controls will become more complex, and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, subject us to investigations from regulatory authorities or cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe incur significantly increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance efforts. Public company requirements may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention, which could adversely impact our ability to execute our strategy and harm operating results.\nWe incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as amended (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as related rules implemented by the SEC, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. In addition, rules that the SEC is implementing or is required to implement pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to require additional change. We expect that ongoing compliance with these and other similar laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, will substantially increase our expenses, including legal and accounting costs, and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. It is possible that these expenses will exceed the increases that management projects. These laws, rules and regulations may also make it more expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage, which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on its board of directors or as officers.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increases the demands on our systems and resources.\nCertain executives have more experience in managing a public company than other members of our management team. Our internal infrastructure may not be adequate to support increased reporting obligations, and we may be unable to hire, train or retain necessary staff and may be reliant on engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome lack of experience or employees. Our management may fail to comply with public company requirements, or may fail to do so effectively and efficiently, either of which would materially and adversely harm our ability to execute our strategy and, consequently, our operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nGlobal capital and credit market conditions could materially and adversely affect our ability to access the capital and credit markets or the ability of key counterparties to perform their obligations to us.\nAlthough we believe the banks participating in our credit facility have adequate capital and resources, we can provide no assurance that all of those banks will continue to operate as a going concern in the future. If any of the banks in our lending group were to fail, it is possible that the borrowing capacity under our facility would be reduced. Practical, legal and tax limitations may also limit our ability to access and service the working capital needs of our businesses. In the event that the availability under our credit facility were reduced significantly, we could be required to obtain capital from alternate sources to finance our capital needs. The options for addressing such capital constraints would include, among others, obtaining commitments from the remaining banks in the lending group or from new banks to fund increased amounts under the terms of our credit facility, and seeking to access the public capital markets. In addition, we may delay certain capital expenditures to ensure that we maintain appropriate levels of liquidity. If it became necessary to access additional capital, any such alternatives could have terms less favorable than those terms under our credit facility, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, in the future we may need to raise additional funds to, among other things, refinance existing indebtedness, fund existing operations, improve or expand its operations, respond to competitive pressures or make acquisitions. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to achieve our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively. Our ability to pursue certain future opportunities may depend in part on our ongoing access to debt and equity capital markets. We cannot assure you that any such financing will be available on terms satisfactory to us or at all. If we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our growth by, among other things, curtailing the expansion of our fleet of units or our acquisition strategy.\nEconomic disruptions affecting key counterparties could also materially adversely affect our business. We monitor the financial strength of our larger customers, derivative counterparties, lenders, vendors, service providers and insurance carriers on a periodic basis using publicly-available information to evaluate our exposure to those who have or who we believe may\nlikely experience significant threats to their ability to adequately perform their obligations to us. The information available will differ from counterparty to counterparty and may be insufficient for us to adequately interpret or evaluate our exposure and/or determine appropriate or timely responses.\nOur leverage may make it difficult for us to service our debt and operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $1,663.0 of total indebtedness, excluding deferred financing fees, consisting of $903.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility, $270.0 million of 7.875% senior secured notes due December 15, 2022, and $490.0 million of 6.875% senior secured notes due August 15, 2023. Our leverage could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022 making it more difficult to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt and liabilities;\n\u2022 requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt payments, thus reducing the\navailability of cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital expenditures on our existing fleet\nor a new fleet and for other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow\nand that, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage would prevent us from pursuing;\n\u2022 limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022 restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities or causing us to make\nnon-strategic divestitures; and\n\u2022 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such\nadditional financings.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations or to refinance our debt depends on our future operating and financial performance, which will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before its maturity, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we may not be able to affect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of our existing or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. If we default on the payments required under the terms of certain of our indebtedness, that indebtedness, together with debt incurred pursuant to other debt agreements or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all of our debts. As a result, our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the indentures that governs our outstanding secured notes and the credit agreement that governs our credit facility contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of debt that we could incur in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the indentures and the credit agreement do not prevent us from incurring other obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. If we add debt to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing debt levels, the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness described above, including our possible inability to service our debt, will increase.\nWe are subject to and may, in the future become subject to, covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility and, if we default under our debt covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations.\nThe credit agreement that governs our credit facility and the indentures that govern our outstanding notes, as well as any instruments that govern any future debt obligations, contain covenants that impose significant restrictions on the way our subsidiaries can operate, including restrictions on the ability to:\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain types of stock;\n\u2022 create or incur certain liens;\n\u2022 make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to our equity securities;\n\u2022 prepay or redeem junior debt;\n\u2022 make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;\n\u2022 engage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 create unrestricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022 create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to, and on\nthe transfer of, assets to the issuer or any restricted subsidiary;\n\u2022 sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022 sell or transfer all or substantially all our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; and\n\u2022 issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries.\nAlthough these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications, these covenants could limit our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may be in our interest. Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If any of our subsidiaries default on their obligations under our credit facility or our secured notes, then the relevant lenders or holders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, if any, immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt. If the debt under our credit facility, the indentures or any other material financing arrangement that we enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full the credit facility, the secured notes and our other debt.\nThe credit agreement that governs our credit facility also requires our subsidiaries to satisfy specified financial maintenance tests in the event that we do not satisfy certain excess liquidity requirements. Deterioration in our operating results, as well as events beyond our control, including increases in raw materials prices and unfavorable economic conditions, could affect the ability to meet these tests, and we cannot assure that we will meet these tests. If an event of default occurs under our credit facility, the lenders could terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand. In these circumstances, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness then outstanding.\nThe amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our credit facility is subject to compliance with limits based on a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder. As a result, our access to credit under the credit facility is subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date, as well as certain discretionary rights of the agent in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value. As a result of any change in valuation, the availability under the credit facility may be reduced, or we may be required to make a repayment of the credit facility, which may be significant. The inability to borrow under the credit facility or the use of available cash to repay the credit facility as a result of a valuation change may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nThe uncertainty regarding the potential phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact our operating results.\nLIBOR, the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt, including our asset backed credit facility and interest rate swaps is expected to be phased out after 2021, when private-sector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate. Without this data, LIBOR may no longer be published, or the lack of quality and quantity of data may cause the rate to no longer be representative of the market. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, although the U.S. Federal Reserve, in connection with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Secured Overnight Financing Rate is a more generic measure than LIBOR and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. Given the inherent differences between LIBOR and Secured Overnight Financing Rate or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established, there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR, including but not limited to the need to amend\nall contracts with LIBOR as the referenced rate and how this will impact the Company\u2019s cost of variable rate debt and derivative financial instruments. The Company will also need to consider new contracts and if they should reference an alternative benchmark rate or include suggested fallback language, as published by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt or derivative financial instruments which may be detrimental to our financial position or operating results.\nIf our warrants are exercised, the number of shares of our Class A common stock eligible for future resale in the public market would increase and result in dilution to our stockholders.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had issued and outstanding 24,232,867 warrants exercisable for 12,116,433 shares of WillScot Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share and 9,977,516 warrants exercisable for 9,977,516 shares of WillScot Class A common stock at an exercise price of $15.50 per share. To the extent warrants are exercised, additional Class A shares will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of our Class A common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. We would also receive a cash capital contribution equal to the number of warrants exercised multiplied times the exercise price of the warrant, to the extent the warrants are not exercised on a cashless basis. In addition, sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Refer to the Recent Developments section in Part I, Item 1, Business, herein for further information about our recent Warrant Redemption.\nOur principal stockholder controls a significant amount of our common stock and has substantial control over our business, and it may take actions or have interests that are adverse to or conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Sapphire, which TDR Capital controls, beneficially owned approximately 45.1% of our Class A Common Stock and 100% of our outstanding Class B common stock. Sapphire also owns warrants giving it the right to buy 2,425,000 additional shares of our Class A common stock, and also has the right to receive additional new shares of our Class A common stock in exchange for its stock of WS Holdings, pursuant to an exchange agreement with us, which we described in Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTwo directors nominated by TDR Capital currently serve on our board of directors. As a result of its control of a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock, TDR Capital may have substantial control over matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. TDR Capital may have interests that are different from those of other stockholders.\nSapphire's ownership of our common stock may adversely affect the trading price for our Class A shares to the extent investors perceive disadvantages in owning shares of a company with a significant stockholder or in the event Sapphire takes any action with its shares that could result in an adverse impact on the price of our Class A shares, including a sale of a substantial portion of our common shares.\nIn August 2018, Sapphire pledged all of the Class A shares that it owns as security for a margin loan under which Sapphire borrowed $125.0 million. An event of default under the margin loan could result in the foreclosure on the pledged securities and a subsequent sale of a significant number of shares of our common stock by the lender, which could cause the market price of our Class A shares to decline. Moreover, the occurrence of a foreclosure, and a subsequent sale of all, or substantially all, of the pledged shares could result in a change of control under the credit agreement governing our credit facility and the indentures governing our secured notes, even when such change may not be in the best interest of our stockholders. Such sale of Sapphire\u2019s pledged shares may also result in another stockholder beneficially owning a significant amount of our common stock and being able to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs. Such stockholder's interests may be different from or conflict with those of TDR Capital or our other stockholders.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nIn order to complete the Merger, we must obtain certain governmental authorizations, and if such authorizations are not granted or are granted with conditions that become applicable to the parties, completion of the Merger may be jeopardized or prevented or the anticipated benefits of the Merger could be reduced.\nCompletion of the Merger is conditioned upon the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and certain other applicable laws or regulations and the required governmental authorizations having been obtained and being in full force and effect. Although we have agreed in the Merger Agreement to use our reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain governmental filings or obtain the governmental authorizations required to complete the Merger, as the case may be, there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting periods will expire or authorizations will be obtained and no assurance that the Merger will be completed.\nIn addition, the governmental authorities from which these authorizations are required have broad discretion in administering the governing laws and regulations, and may take into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the Merger, including other potential transactions in the specialty rental services industry, the portal storage industry or other industries. These governmental authorities may initiate proceedings seeking to prevent, or otherwise seek to prevent, the Merger. As a condition to authorization of the Merger or related transactions, these governmental authorities also may impose requirements, limitations or costs, require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after completion of the Merger.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are not required to agree to or commit to any actions that individually or in the aggregate would, or could reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), assets, liabilities, business or results of operations of the combined company. However, notwithstanding the provisions of the Merger Agreement, we could become subject to terms or conditions in connection with such waiting periods, laws or other authorizations (whether because such term or condition does not rise to the specified level of materiality or we otherwise consent to its imposition) the imposition of which could adversely affect our ability to integrate Mobile Mini\u2019s operations with our operations, reduce the anticipated benefits of the Merger or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations after completion of the Merger.\nIn addition to receipt of certain governmental authorizations, completion of the Merger is subject to a number of other conditions, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger will not be completed.\nOur obligations to complete the Merger are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions in addition to receipt of certain governmental authorizations, including, among other conditions: (i) approval of the Merger by Mobile Mini\u2019s stockholders at a Mobile Mini special meeting, (ii) approval of the stock issuance by us to Mobile Mini\u2019s stockholders and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation by our stockholders at a WillScot special meeting, (iii) absence of any applicable law or order that prohibits completion of the Merger, (iv) accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the Merger Agreement by Mobile Mini, subject to certain materiality qualifications, (v) performance in all material respects by Mobile Mini of the material obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to completion of the transaction, and (vi) the absence of a material adverse effect on Mobile Mini. There can be no assurance that the conditions to completion of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or that the Merger will be completed.\nAfter completion of the Merger, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger, which could adversely affect the value of shares of our common stock.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our and Mobile Mini\u2019s businesses. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks, including:\n\u2022our ability to successfully combine our and Mobile Mini\u2019s businesses and the costs relating thereto;\n\u2022whether the combined business will perform as expected;\n\u2022the possibility that we paid more for Mobile Mini than the value we will derive from the acquisition;\n\u2022the incurrence of additional indebtedness in connection with the Merger; and\n\u2022the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of Mobile Mini.\nIf we are not able to successfully combine our and Mobile Mini\u2019s businesses within the anticipated time frame, or at all, or the costs of such combination exceed our current expectation, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined business may not perform as expected and the value of the shares of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nWe and Mobile Mini have operated and, until completion of the Merger will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that our respective businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of our key employees, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, issues that must be addressed in integrating our and Mobile Mini\u2019s operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger so the combined business performs as expected include, among other things:\n\u2022combining the companies\u2019 separate operational, commercial, financial, reporting and corporate functions;\n\u2022integrating the companies\u2019 products and services;\n\u2022identifying and eliminating redundant operations and assets;\n\u2022harmonizing the companies\u2019 operating practices, employee development, compensation and benefit programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes;\n\u2022addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022consolidating the companies\u2019 corporate, administrative and information technology infrastructure;\n\u2022coordinating sales, distribution and marketing efforts;\n\u2022managing the movement of certain businesses and positions to different locations;\n\u2022maintaining existing agreements with customers and suppliers and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers and suppliers; and\n\u2022effecting potential actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.\nIn addition, at times, the attention of certain members of our management and resources may be focused on completion of the Merger and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt our ongoing business and the business of the combined company.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of Mobile Mini\u2019s stockholders failing to approve the Merger or our stockholders failing to approve the stock issuance by us to Mobile Mini\u2019s stockholders and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our ongoing business may be materially and adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the trading price of our common stock and other securities, and from our customers, suppliers and employees;\n\u2022we may be required to pay Mobile Mini a termination fee of $66.6 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances;\n\u2022we will be required to pay certain transaction expenses and other costs incurred in connection with the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed;\n\u2022the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our businesses prior to completion of the Merger, and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of Mobile Mini, may prevent us from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the Merger that we would have made, taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place; and\n\u2022matters relating to the Merger (including arranging permanent financing and integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nThere can be no assurance that the risks described above will not materialize. If any of those risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, financial results, ratings, stock prices and/or bond prices.\nWe may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Merger, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed, which may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operation.", "PERMNO": 15782, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "WSC"}
