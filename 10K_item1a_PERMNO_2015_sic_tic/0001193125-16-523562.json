{"cik": "719402", "company": "FIRST NATIONAL CORP /VA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s securities involves risks. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, investors in the Company\u2019s securities should carefully consider the factors discussed below. These factors could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position, and could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from its historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report, in which case the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities could decline.\nRisks Related To The Company\u2019s Business\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nThe community banking industry is directly affected by national, regional, and local economic conditions. The economies in the Company\u2019s market areas continued to show improvement during 2015. Management allocates significant resources to mitigate and respond to risks associated with the current economic conditions, however, such conditions cannot be predicted or controlled. Therefore, such conditions, including a reduction in federal government spending, a flatter yield curve, and extended low interest rates, could adversely affect the credit quality of the Company\u2019s loans, and/or the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s financial performance is dependent on the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, in particular, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services the Company offers. In addition, the Company holds securities which can be significantly affected by various factors including credit ratings assigned by third parties. An adverse credit rating in securities held by the Company could result in a reduction of the fair value of its securities portfolio and have an adverse impact on its financial condition. While general economic conditions in Virginia and the U.S. continued to improve in 2015, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue.\nThe inability of the Company to successfully manage its growth or implement its growth strategy may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial conditions.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully implement its growth strategy if it is unable to expand market share in existing locations, identify attractive markets, locations, or opportunities to expand in the future. In addition, the ability to manage growth successfully depends on whether the Company can maintain adequate capital levels, maintain cost controls, effectively manage asset quality, and successfully integrate any expanded business divisions or acquired businesses into the organization.\nAs the Company continues to implement its growth strategy by opening new branches or acquiring branches or banks, it expects to incur increased personnel, occupancy, and other operating expenses. In the case of new branches, the Company must absorb those higher expenses while it begins to generate new deposits. In the case of acquired branches, the Company must absorb higher expenses while it begins deploying the newly assumed deposit liabilities. With either new branches opened or branches acquired, there would be a time lag involved in deploying new deposits into attractively priced loans and other higher yielding earning assets. Thus, the Company\u2019s plans to expand could depress earnings in the short run, even if it efficiently executes a branching strategy leading to long-term financial benefits.\nDifficulties in combining the operations of acquired bank branches or entities with the Company\u2019s own operations may prevent the Company from achieving the expected benefits from acquisitions.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve fully the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies expected in an acquisition. Inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of an acquired entity. In addition, the markets and industries in which the Company and its potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. The Company may lose customers or the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition; the Company may lose key personnel, either from the acquired entity or from itself; and the Company may not be able to control the incremental increase in noninterest expense arising from an acquisition in a manner that improves its overall operating efficiencies. These factors could contribute to the Company\u2019s not achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions within desired time frames, if at all. Future business acquisitions could be material to the Company and it may issue additional shares of common stock to support those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership interests. Acquisitions also could require the Company to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt; the Company could therefore become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures.\nThe Company faces substantial competition that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth and/or operating results.\nThe Company operates in a competitive market for financial services and faces intense competition from other financial institutions both in making loans and attracting deposits which can greatly affect pricing for its products and services. The Company\u2019s primary competitors include community, regional, and national banks as well as credit unions and mortgage companies. Many of these financial institutions have been in business for many years, are significantly larger, have established customer bases and have greater financial resources and higher lending limits. In addition, credit unions are exempt from corporate income taxes, providing a significant competitive pricing advantage. Accordingly, some of the Company\u2019s competitors in its market have the ability to offer products and services that it is unable to offer or to offer at more competitive rates.\nConsumers may increasingly decide not to use the Bank to complete their financial transactions, which would have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe carrying value of intangible assets, such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles, may be adversely affected.\nWhen a Company completes an acquisition, intangibles, such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles, are recorded on the date of acquisition as an asset. Current accounting guidance requires an evaluation for impairment, and the Company would perform such impairment analysis at least annually. A significant adverse change in expected future cash flows, sustained adverse change in the Company\u2019s common stock, or a decline in core deposit balances could require the asset to become impaired. If impaired, the Company would incur a charge to earnings that could have a significant impact on the results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nFrom time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the performance of the Bank\u2019s fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the performance of the Bank\u2019s fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties, and its financial condition could be adversely affected if it relies on misleading information.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or to enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, the Company may rely on information furnished to it by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information, which the Company does not independently verify. The Company also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, the Company may assume that a customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the customer. The Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent it relies on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.\nThe Company\u2019s dependency on its management team and the unexpected loss of any of those personnel could adversely affect operations.\nThe Company has assembled an experienced management team and continues to build the depth of that team. Although management development plans are in place, the unexpected loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and may result in lower revenues or greater expenses.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure controls could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nEffective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, and to operate successfully as a public company. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, its reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of the Company\u2019s ongoing monitoring of internal controls, it may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control that require remediation. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company continually works on improving its internal controls. However, the Company cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that it implements and maintains adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of the Company\u2019s internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm the Company\u2019s reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s risk-management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nThe Company maintains an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, quantify, monitor, report, and control the risks that it faces. These risks include: interest-rate, credit, liquidity, operations, reputation, compliance, and litigation. While the Company assesses and improves this program on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that its approach and framework for risk management and related controls will effectively mitigate all risk and limit losses in its business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the Company\u2019s risk-management program, or if its controls break down, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact liquidity and profitability.\nAs a financial institution, the Company\u2019s earnings, liquidity, and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion of the Company and of the financial services industry as a whole. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, the failure of any product or service sold by us to meet our clients\u2019 expectations or applicable regulatory requirements, corporate governance and acquisitions, or from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep, attract and/or retain customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by one of our businesses can result in negative public opinion about our other businesses. Negative public opinion could also affect our ability to borrow funds in the unsecured wholesale debt markets.\nNegative perception of the Company through social media may adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and business.\nThe Company\u2019s reputation is critical to the success of its business. The Company believes that its brand image has been well received by customers, reflecting the fact that the brand image, like the Company\u2019s business, is based in part on trust and confidence. The Company\u2019s reputation and brand image could be negatively affected by rapid and widespread distribution of publicity through social media channels. The Company\u2019s reputation could also be affected by the Company\u2019s association with clients affected negatively through social media distribution, or other third parties, or by circumstances outside of the Company\u2019s control. Negative publicity, whether true or untrue, could affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract or retain customers, or cause the Company to incur additional liabilities or costs, or result in additional regulatory scrutiny.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s income and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and the policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory agencies. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the prepayment of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding. The impact of these changes may be magnified if the Company does not effectively manage the relative sensitivity of its assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to reflect such interest rate changes in pricing its products is influenced by competitive pressures. Fluctuations in these areas may adversely affect the Company and its shareholders. The Bank is often at a competitive disadvantage in managing its costs of funds compared to the large regional, super-regional, or national banks that have access to the national and international capital markets.\nThe Company generally seeks to maintain a neutral position in terms of the volume of assets and liabilities that mature or re-price during any period so that it may reasonably maintain its net interest margin; however, interest rate fluctuations, loan prepayments, loan production, deposit flows, and competitive pressures are constantly changing and influence the ability to maintain a neutral position. Generally, the Company\u2019s earnings will be more sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates depending upon the variance in volume of assets and liabilities that mature and re-price in any period. The extent and duration of the sensitivity will depend on the cumulative variance over time, the velocity and direction of changes in interest rates, shape and slope of the yield curve, and whether the Company is more asset sensitive or liability sensitive. Accordingly, the Company may not be successful in maintaining a neutral position and, as a result, the Company\u2019s net interest margin may be affected.\nLimited availability of financing or inability to raise capital could adversely impact the Company.\nThe amount, type, source, and cost of the Company\u2019s funding and capital directly impacts the ability to grow assets. The ability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings and other sources, or raise capital could become more difficult, more expensive, or altogether unavailable. A number of factors could make such financing more difficult, more expensive or unavailable including: the financial condition of the Company at any given time; rate disruptions in the capital markets; the reputation for soundness and security of the financial services industry as a whole; and, competition for funding from other banks or similar financial service companies, some of which could be substantially larger or be more favorably rated.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to operational, technological, and organizational risk may adversely affect the Company.\nSimilar to other financial institutions, the Company is exposed to many types of operational and technological risk, including reputation, legal, and compliance risk. The Company\u2019s ability to grow and compete is dependent on its ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure while it expands and integrates acquired businesses. Operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, occurrences of fraud by employees or persons outside of the Company, and exposure to external events. The Company is dependent on its operational infrastructure to help manage these risks. From time to time, it may need to change or upgrade its technology infrastructure. The Company may experience disruption, and it may face additional exposure to these risks during the course of making such changes. If the Company would acquire another financial institution or bank branch operations, it would face additional challenges when integrating different operational platforms. Such integration efforts may be more disruptive to the business and/or more costly than anticipated.\nThe Company and the Bank rely on other companies to provide key components of their business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of the Company\u2019s (and the Bank\u2019s) business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections, and network access. While the Company has selected these third party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problem caused by these third parties, including poor performance of services, failure to provide services, disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor and failure to handle current or higher volumes, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business, and may harm its reputation. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt the Company\u2019s operations if those difficulties affect the vendor\u2019s ability to serve the Company. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to the Company\u2019s business operations.\nThe Company continually encounters technological change which could affect its ability to remain competitive.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company continues to invest in technology and connectivity to automate functions previously performed manually, to facilitate the ability of customers to engage in financial transactions, and otherwise to enhance the customer experience with respect to its products and services. The Company\u2019s continued success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy customer demands and create efficiencies in its operations. A failure to maintain or enhance a competitive position with respect to technology, whether because of a failure to anticipate customer expectations or because the Company\u2019s technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not rolled out in a timely manner, may cause the Company to lose market share or incur additional expense.\nThe operational functions of business counterparties over which the Company may have limited or no control may experience disruptions that could adversely impact the Company.\nMultiple major U.S. retailers have recently experienced data systems incursions reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other financial data of the retailers\u2019 customers. Retailer incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including the Bank. Although neither the Company\u2019s nor the Bank\u2019s systems are breached in retailer incursions, these events can cause the Bank to reissue a significant number of cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to the Bank and its customers. In some cases, the Bank may be required to reimburse customers for the losses they incur. Other possible points of intrusion or disruption not within the Company\u2019s nor the Bank\u2019s control include internet service providers, electronic mail portal providers, social media portals, distant-server (\u201ccloud\u201d) service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers.\nThe Company\u2019s operations may be adversely affected by cyber security risks.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees in systems and on networks. The secure processing, maintenance, and use of this information is critical to operations and the Company\u2019s business strategy. The Company has invested in accepted technologies, and continually reviews processes and practices that are designed to protect its networks, computers, and data from damage or unauthorized access. Despite these security measures, the Company\u2019s computer systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. A breach of any kind could compromise systems and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged or disclosed. A breach in security could result in legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect its business. Furthermore, as cyber threats continue to evolve and increase, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify or enhance its protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any identified information security vulnerabilities.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s nonperforming assets adversely affect its net income in various ways. The Company does not record interest income on nonaccrual loans, which adversely affects its income and increases loan administration costs. When the Company receives collateral through foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to mark the related loan to the then fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, which may result in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets also increases the Company\u2019s risk profile and may affect the capital levels that the Company believes are appropriate in light of such risks. The Company utilizes various techniques such as workouts, restructurings, and loan sales to manage problem assets. Increases in or negative adjustments in the value of these problem assets, the underlying collateral, or in the borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and staff, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, including origination of new loans. There can be no assurance that the Company will avoid further increases in nonperforming loans in the future.\nThe Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in its loan portfolio.\nLike all financial institutions, the Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans that its borrowers may not repay in their entirety. The Bank believes that it maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date and in compliance with applicable accounting and regulatory guidance. However, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results. Accounting measurements related to impairment and the allowance for loan losses require significant estimates that are subject to uncertainty and changes relating to new information and changing circumstances. The significant uncertainties surrounding the ability of the Bank\u2019s borrowers to execute their business models successfully through changing economic environments, competitive challenges, and other factors complicate the Bank\u2019s estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan. Because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change, the actual losses may vary from current estimates. The Company expects fluctuations in the loan loss provisions due to the uncertain economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require the Bank to increase its allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense, or to decrease the allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge-offs, net of recoveries. Any such required additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Bank\u2019s valuation allowance on OREO becomes inadequate, results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Bank maintains a valuation allowance that it believes is a reasonable estimate of known losses in OREO. The Bank obtains appraisals on all OREO properties on an annual basis and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. The carrying value of OREO is susceptible to changes in economic and real estate market conditions. Although the Company believes the valuation allowance is a reasonable estimate of known losses, such losses and the adequacy of the allowance cannot be fully predicted. Excessive declines in market values could have a material impact on financial performance.\nThe Bank\u2019s concentration in loans secured by real estate may adversely affect earnings due to changes in the real estate markets.\nThe Bank offers a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer, and other loans. Many of the Bank\u2019s loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) in the Bank\u2019s market areas. A major change in the real estate markets, resulting in deterioration in the value of this collateral, or in the local or national economy, could adversely affect borrowers\u2019 ability to pay these loans, which in turn could negatively affect the Bank. Risks of loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry; the Bank tries to limit its exposure to these risks by monitoring extensions of credit carefully. The Bank cannot fully eliminate credit risk; thus, credit losses will occur in the future. Additionally, changes in the real estate market also affect the value of foreclosed assets, and therefore, additional losses may occur when management determines it is appropriate to sell the assets.\nThe Bank has a significant concentration of credit exposure in commercial real estate, and loans with this type of collateral are viewed as having more risk of default.\nThe Bank\u2019s commercial real estate portfolio consists primarily of owner-operated properties and other commercial properties. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans. They are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and depend on cash flows from the owner\u2019s business or the property to service the debt. Cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions, and a downturn in the local economy or in occupancy rates in the local economy where the property is located could increase the likelihood of default. Because the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in the percentage of non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Bank\u2019s banking regulators generally give commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies, and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures, which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s loan portfolio contains construction and development loans, and a decline in real estate values and economic conditions would adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the loans and have an adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition.\nAlthough most of the Bank\u2019s construction and development loans are secured by real estate, the Bank believes that, in the case of the majority of these loans, the real estate collateral by itself may not be a sufficient source for repayment of the loan if real estate values decline. If the Bank is required to liquidate the collateral securing a construction and development loan to satisfy the debt, its earnings and capital may be adversely affected. A period of reduced real estate values may continue for some time, resulting in potential adverse effects on the Bank\u2019s earnings and capital.\nThe Company\u2019s credit standards and its on-going credit assessment processes might not protect it from significant credit losses.\nThe Company assumes credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. The Company manages credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit decisions and a continuous quality assessment process of credit already extended. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize local lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. The Company\u2019s credit administration function employs risk management techniques to help ensure that problem loans are promptly identified. While these procedures are designed to provide the Company with the information needed to implement policy adjustments where necessary and to take appropriate corrective actions, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit risk.\nThe Company\u2019s focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase its credit risk.\nMost of the Company\u2019s commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. If general economic conditions in the market areas in which the Company operates negatively impact this important customer sector, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by the Company in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Any deterioration of the borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank relies upon independent appraisals to determine the value of the real estate which secures a significant portion of its loans, and the values indicated by such appraisals may not be realizable if the Bank is forced to foreclose upon such loans.\nA significant portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate. The Bank relies upon independent appraisers to estimate the value of such real estate. Appraisals are only estimates of value and the independent appraisers may make mistakes of fact or judgment that adversely affect the reliability of their appraisals. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to increase or decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the real estate securing some of the Bank\u2019s loans may be more or less valuable than anticipated at the time the loans were made. If a default occurs on a loan secured by real estate that is less valuable than originally estimated, the Bank may not be able to recover the outstanding balance of the loan.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act substantially changes the regulation of the financial services industry and it could have a material adverse effect upon the Company.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides wide-ranging changes in the way banks and financial services firms generally are regulated and affect the way the Company and its customers and counterparties do business with each other. Among other things, it requires increased capital and regulatory oversight for banks and their holding companies, changes the deposit insurance assessment system, changes responsibilities among regulators, establishes the CFPB, and makes various changes in the securities laws and corporate governance that affect public companies, including the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires numerous studies and regulations related to its implementation. The Company is continually evaluating the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act, together with implementing the regulations that have been proposed and adopted. The ultimate effects of the Dodd-Frank Act and the resulting rulemaking cannot be predicted at this time, but it has increased the Company\u2019s operating and compliance costs in the short-term, and it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements as a result of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and the Dodd-Frank Act, the short-term and long-term impact of which is uncertain.\nThe Company and the Bank are each subject to capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital which each must maintain. From time to time, regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies have established stricter capital requirements and leverage limits for banks and bank holding companies that are based on the Basel III regulatory capital reforms. These stricter capital requirements will be phased-in over a four-year period, which began on January 1, 2015, until they are fully-implemented on January 1, 2019. The application of these more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital and adversely affect future growth opportunities. In addition, if the Company and the Bank fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and/or other regulatory requirements, the Company\u2019s financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRecent regulations issued by the CFPB could adversely impact the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to financial institutions that offer covered financial products and services to consumers. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a final rule effective January 10, 2014, requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms, or to originate \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d that meet specific requirements with respect to terms, pricing, and fees. The rule also contains additional disclosure requirements at mortgage loan origination and in monthly statements. These requirements could limit the Company\u2019s ability to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and/or time consuming to make these loans, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nCurrent and proposed regulation addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could increase the Company\u2019s costs and impact its reputation.\nThe Company is subject to a number of laws concerning consumer privacy and data use and securities, including information safeguard rules under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These rules require that financial institutions develop, implement, and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution\u2019s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution\u2019s activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. The United States has experienced a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy and data security, including requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach. In addition, most states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of certain types of security breaches. New regulations in these areas may increase compliance costs, which could negatively impact earnings. In addition, failure to comply with the privacy and data use and security laws and regulations to which the Company is subject, including by reason of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information, could result in fines, sanctions, penalties, or other adverse consequences and loss of consumer confidence, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, overall business, and reputation.\nLegislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, could adversely affect the Company or the businesses in which the Company is engaged.\nThe Company is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision, and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations. Laws and regulations change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, and the FDIC\u2019s DIF. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively affect the Company or its ability to increase the value of its business. Such changes include higher capital requirements, and could include increased insurance premiums, increased compliance costs, reductions of noninterest income, and limitations on services that can be provided. Actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against the Company could cause it to devote significant time and resources to defend itself and may lead to liability or penalties that materially affect the Company and its shareholders. Future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations or enforcement could be materially adverse to the Company and its shareholders.\nSee the section of this report entitled \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d for additional information on the statutory and regulatory issues that affect the Company\u2019s business.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nThe authorities that promulgate accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB), the United States Securities Exchange Commission (the SEC), and other regulatory authorities, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of financial statements for prior periods. Such changes could also require the Company to incur additional personnel or technology costs.\nRisks Related To The Company\u2019s Securities\nThe Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends depends upon the results of operations of its Bank subsidiary.\nThe Company is a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiary Bank. As a result, the Company\u2019s ability to make dividend payments on its common stock depends primarily on certain federal regulatory considerations and the receipt of dividends and other distributions from the Bank. There are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company. Although the Company has historically paid a cash dividend to the holders of its common stock, holders of the common stock are not entitled to receive dividends, and regulatory or economic factors may cause the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to consider, among other things, the reduction of dividends paid on the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThere is a limited trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock; it may be difficult to sell shares.\nThe trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock has been relatively limited. Even if a more active market develops, there can be no assurance that a more active and liquid trading market for the common stock will exist in the future. Consequently, shareholders may not be able to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares. In addition, the Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of its common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of the common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, could cause the price of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline, or reduce the Company\u2019s ability to raise capital through future sales of common stock. The lack of liquidity of the investment in the common shares should be carefully considered when making an investment decision.\nFuture issuances of the Company\u2019s common stock could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could be dilutive.\nThe Company is not restricted from issuing additional authorized shares of common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of common stock. Issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the expectation that such issuances might occur, including in connection with acquisitions by the Company, could materially adversely affect the market price of the shares of common stock and could be dilutive to shareholders. Because the Company\u2019s decision to issue common stock in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors, it cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of possible future issuances of its common stock. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s shareholders bear the risk that future issuances will reduce the market price of the common stock and dilute their stock holdings in the Company.\nThe current economic conditions may cause volatility in the Company\u2019s common stock value.\nIn the current economic environment, the value of publicly traded stocks in the financial services sector has been volatile. However, even in a more stable economic environment the value of the Company\u2019s common stock can be affected by a variety of factors such as expected results of operations, actual results of operations, actions taken by shareholders, news or expectations based on the performance of others in the financial services industry, and expected impacts of a changing regulatory environment. These factors not only impact the value of the Company\u2019s common stock but could also affect the liquidity of the stock given the Company\u2019s size, geographical footprint, and industry.\nThe Company\u2019s subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt are superior to our common stock, which may limit our ability to pay dividends on common stock in the future.\nOur ability to pay dividends on common stock is also limited by contractual restrictions under our subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt. Interest must be paid on the subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt before dividends may be paid to common shareholders. The Company is current in its interest payments on subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt; however, it has the right to defer distributions on its junior subordinated debt, during which time no dividends may be paid on its common stock. If the Company does not have sufficient earnings in the future and begins to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debt, it will be unable to pay dividends on its common stock until it becomes current on those distributions.\nThe Company\u2019s governing documents and Virginia law contain anti-takeover provisions that could negatively affect its shareholders.\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and the Virginia Stock Corporation Act contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of the Board of Directors to deal with attempts to acquire control of the Company. These provisions and the ability to set the voting rights, preferences, and other terms of any series of outstanding preferred stock and preferred stock that may be issued, may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may discourage takeovers (which certain shareholders may deem to be in their best interest). To the extent that such takeover attempts are discouraged, temporary fluctuations in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock resulting from actual or rumored takeover attempts may be inhibited. These provisions also could discourage or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest, even though such transactions may be favorable to the interests of shareholders, and could potentially adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company may deregister under the Exchange Act, which would result in a reduction in the amount and frequency of publicly-available information about the Company.\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act) may allow the Company to terminate the registration of its common stock under the Exchange Act. If the Company determines to deregister its common stock under the Exchange Act, it would enable it to save significant expenses relating to its public disclosure and reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. However, a de-registration of common stock also would result in a reduction in the amount and frequency of publicly-available information about the Company and the Bank.", "PERMNO": 18554, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FXNC"}
